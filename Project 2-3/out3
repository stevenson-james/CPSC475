<vocnois> 
<iver>
now that wa up to ag eighteen to or there about to <sil> <nois> <vocnois> <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> i think that the <vocnois> you said get back to the veri begin of the birth and up to kindergarten so forth <cutoff-we=well> <vocnois> i that's that's the famili <vocnois> but uh i think that we in our educ program <vocnois> <sil> we realli need to start teach uh <vocnois> what i call the older valu uh but but but good valu i <unknown-won't_given_you> whether thei're old or new but good valu <vocnois> <sil> and i think we realli need to have that establish within our educ system <vocnois> uh start in the elementari right on up to colleg i think there ought to be a number of colleg uh cours <vocnois> uh that that devot exclus for thi so that those student can go back and <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> assist in teach <vocnois> but i think that mani of the cours <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> <sil> other cours ought to have <sil> element within them that ar teach valu famili valu <vocnois> um i could even so go so far as to sai chemistri or botani or psycholog <vocnois> uh ani on of those <vocnois> those ar special subject <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> and <vocnois> but <vocnois> the i think there ar element that thei can have within each on of those <vocnois> talk about famili valu famili valu <vocnois> uh and that will help them <vocnois> permeat the entir societi <sil> and but it's got to start back here in the first and i think <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> just uh <ext-why> don't i just go back and copi cat someth she said uh pick up that <cutoff-bai=babi> pick up that child and cuddl it um <sil> and have <vocnois> have that babi touch your skin and uh <vocnois> and uh uh teach <vocnois> <sil> how what love is <vocnois> <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> <sil> uh you <cutoff-do> don't necessarili teach love by word but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother littl brother and the littl sister <vocnois> <sil> all of those <vocnois> <sil> now you sai <vocnois> teach that well my god didn't thei know that when thei first came into thi classroom <vocnois> <sil> no not todai <vocnois> not todai <vocnois> <sil> i i dare sai that uh the vast major and i mean abov fifti well abov fifti percent when i sai that i'm not be arbitrari <vocnois> um <sil> <vocnois> student in high school todai <vocnois> probabl haven't had their mother or their father <vocnois> <sil> truli <vocnois> <sil> hold them and hug them <vocnois> rather than just sai hi johnni <vocnois> bye <iver>

<sil> my answer to your question is ha thi erod i'm gonna answer with the word us the word respect <vocnois> <sil> uh ye i feel that uh <sil> thi ha erod over time <vocnois> uh there's not the respect for our <sil> elder i don't <vocnois> necessarili mean elder in term of the uh chronolog ag but i'm talk in term of gener <vocnois> the uh there's less respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandpar and the great grandpar <vocnois> uh i'm gonna give you a first hand exampl <vocnois> <sil> i just had a <sil> uh convers with on of my granddaught who is now twenti <sil> <vocnois> uh <sil> she will come over to my hous grandpa's hous <vocnois> and she'll come in and she'll flop down in a chair <vocnois> uh <sil> and she will do noth in that household even if you suggest it <vocnois> uh i don't ever <sil> tell her uh do <sil> to do thing <vocnois> and i've point out to her that whenev we went to visit grandpa <vocnois> or great grandfath <vocnois> uh <vocnois> if the if we saw weed out in the garden we went out and we ho the garden if we if or the chicken hous need to be clean uh <vocnois> and thei hadn't gotten to it that dai we went out and clean the chicken hous we would sai <vocnois> grandpa is it okai if we go out and clean your chicken hous well cours you knew veri well it wa gonna be okai <vocnois> but <sil> a matter of respect though you ask is it okai for us to do it <vocnois> and uh <sil> now with her <vocnois> uh <sil> i can have dish out there in the sink uh that ar left there for from breakfast mayb <sil> lunch and <vocnois> uh <sil> she she'll walk out there and will sai <vocnois> well grandpa how come your dish aren't done and then she turn around walk awai <vocnois> <sil> that's right you uh huh <sil> and and she mai then go ahead and sai <vocnois> well now sometim she'll ask and sometim she doesn't but let assum she did she'll ask <vocnois> is it alright if i have some of thi <vocnois> she goe ahead and get the dish out so forth <vocnois> she put them right in there in that sink uh with those other dish <vocnois> make no effort to clean them <sil> <he-and> and <sil> i <sil> i <sil> i've seen thi in mani mani mani incid but i'm give you thi is veri first hand i know thi <vocnois> and i strongli suspect that thi is a typic typic thing in our societi todai <vocnois> so ye in my opinion definit it's erod i know you took a littl differ approach in answer the question <vocnois> uh <sil> from <sil> over the time that that <sil> thi kind of thing is erod base upon the word respect <vocnois> <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> <laugh> <vocnois> <sil> <laugh> <sil> <vocnois> she just us the word penalti <sil> <ext-uh> <vocnois> penalti ha <error-nlot of differ definit each individu ha a mental pictur what the word penalti mean <vocnois> base upon their own experi <vocnois> <sil> all i wanna take just <sil> and it sai it <sil> penalti in a veri gener sort of wai <sil> <vocnois> whatev your extrem is to the right or to the left let come back to about the middl <vocnois> <sil> i'm concern that we ar get awai from penalti <sil> complet <vocnois> and i feel it's absolut essenti that we have penalti we have <vocnois> for everyon <sil> for everyon realli across the board uh we we're get awai from penalti we're get awai from penalti <vocnois> uh <sil> uh so mani peopl i just to give an exampl <vocnois> talk about adult <vocnois> i just read uh statist the other dai right here <error-kah columbu where <vocnois> uh it wa an extrem high percent i can't quot the percentag <vocnois> of peopl who uh ignor uh yellow light and and of consequ thei ar end up go through red light <vocnois> and there mani mani mani accid take place <vocnois> uh <sil> i <sil> and we <sil> it us to be that you could place uh uh an a law enforc offic the corner if it happen and he immedi he would uh <vocnois> penal you by give your ticket and you face the <sil> court as the case mai be <vocnois> well now we have pass so mani littl ordin and law and chang the <vocnois> enforc polici and thi kind of thing <vocnois> well the poor polic offic he can't even do that ani longer he's got <vocnois> if somebodi uh run through red light you almost have to hit somebodi <vocnois> and then be accus for go through the red light <sil> he can't just arbitrarili be there becaus that's call <vocnois> <ext-oh> i think the word harass plai a part <vocnois> you ar harass that individu becaus you were stand there wait for him <vocnois> to commit thi problem <vocnois> when i <sil> let's just get awai from that exampl you can talk about whether you did you were carri <vocnois> uh <sil> i don't want to get in to the gun and knive and stuff in the school that's enough for

so <sil> i mean basic the entir winter i'd either <ext-be> <sil> do stuff by myself or on the team wrestl with my friend so <vocnois> the whole reason i quit wrestl is becaus the coach want me to cut too much weight <vocnois> i wa realli start to feel it physic <iver>
yeah i wa cut twenti pound in three dai <iver>
dehydr <iver>
you'd run around in three pair of sweat suit and <sil> vinyl jump suit over that <vocnois> under heater <iver>
you'd sleep in three pair of sweat so you'd lose about two and a half pound in your sleep <iver>
it is that's why i quit <iver>
by the end i wa pretti much <sil> just puke up blood and pass out a lot <iver>
there were a lot of teammat that were cut that much weight if not more <sil> thei were pretti much do it for the team <nois> <iver>
yeah by then it wa junior year <sil> when we were wrestl <ext-varisti> and everyon just figur it wa two more year left thei could just <sil> struggl through it <iver>
it definit did becaus <sil> i would sleep <vocnois> probabl <sil> the <sil> eight hour <sil> right after practic until i woke up in the morn <iver>
i deliv the columbu dispatch in the morn too so <iver>
it wa pretti much deliv paper go to class wrestl sleep <iver>
almost all the parent did <iver>
but he'd bring in nutrit list or whatev to explain to the <ext-parent> <sil> blah blah blah <iver>
so <iver>
yeah <iver>
not that i know of none of the other sport team were so <sil> inclin to <sil> like push their athlet to cut weight <iver>
or to do anyth extrem to their bodi <iver>
um-hum <iver>
and the lower you ar appar the easier it is or someth <sil> that wa the coach's philosophi anywai <iver>
some of them ar athlet thei're pretti much just <ext-preppi> student council i'm good at school but bad outsid of school <vocnois> thei'd go out and parti outsid of school but thei'd join all like the student against drug program <iver>
so thei're realli hypocrit <iver>
there's a littl bit well quit a bit of it wa yeah <sil> some of the peopl in the group didn't plai sport but it wasn't all from on sport or <sil> it wa footbal wrestler <vocnois> it wa usual <sil> like the best footbal player the best wrestler <iver>
in high school yeah i wa friend with most of them <iver>
but i just didn't <sil> hang out with <sil> the entir crowd <iver>
yeah <iver>
it wasn't so much of a hate thing it wa just more these ar the peopl i like to hang out with <ext-if> <sil> you don't like that that's fine <iver>
<vocnois> our school wasn't realli a violent on there weren't realli ani fight or anyth <iver>
it wa mostli caucasian <sil> and veri few asian and other ethnic <iver>
yeah my roommat actual had that teacher and <sil> none of the alleg ar true <iver>
she wa alleg that student were write racial slur on their desk and stuff <sil> but <sil> i had friend in class of her and none of them wrote ani <iver>
thei never saw it thei never said anyth about it <sil> 
<sil> <iver>
a lot of peopl switch from be like the realli quiet more reserv peopl to the <sil> parti anim <iver>
go out and have fun person <iver>
just the number of peopl that were here <iver>
<iver>
brother <iver>
brother jed <iver>

yeah <iver>
yeah i think everi colleg doe <iver>
um <vocnois> i'm a lutheran and a lot of what he sai about everyon go to hell <iver>
is <ext-realli> oppos my belief so i stand there and pretti much spar with him about it <ext-and> he usual end up get frustrat and tell me to leav <iver>
well <sil> he told a jewish friend of mine that <sil> her grandpar that di in the holocaust went to hell becaus thei were jewish <sil> <iver>
yeah he sai <vocnois> a lot of racial slur like that he's realli homophob <iver>
where <ext-as> <vocnois> i don't know lutheran is a littl bit more open to <iver>
homosexu i guess <iver>
just pretti much that if you ask for forgiv forgiv is grant <vocnois> whatev <iver>
um doesn't <sil> just becaus you sin doesn't mean you're go to <ext-hell> <iver>
<vocnois> and <vocnois> pretti much stuff like <ext-that> <sil> and he'd try to quot the bibl and i'd have a bibl there with me and i'd look it up and <vocnois> it wouldn't <sil> it wouldn't be right at all <iver>
yeah <laugh> <iver>
yeah <sil> <iver>
well when he's tell my friend that their grandpar went to hell becaus thei're of a differ religion <iver>
that's pretti extrem <iver>
yeah um <sil> i've grown up here all my life so it realli hasn't shock me all that <ext-much> <iver>
yeah i had about three or four friend that were actual gai <iver>
it wasn't a huge shock it wasn't my first encount with homosexu <iver>
if thei wanna get marri that's their busi i don't <sil> think <ext-it> <sil> mine or anyon els to sai that thei can't <iver>
thei're normal peopl just outsid of <sil> their sexual <sil> well <sil> major of the peopl prefer <sil> heterosexu <iver>
relat but thei're normal peopl outsid of thei're <sil> homosexu i mean it's noth differ than regular parent <iver>
i <sil> realli am not educ in that at all so i wouldn't <sil> probabl sai anyth <sil> sinc i'd <sil> ignor in the field <iver>
um-hum <iver>
yeah he us a lot <ext-of> <sil> differ slur toward <sil> gai peopl <iver>
yeah i rememb polit correct <iver>
chang the word doesn't chang how someon feel about someth <iver>
i don't think it made us ani better or ani <ext-wors> <iver>
it's just chang the languag <iver>
<vocnois> i don't think so not with the divers that we have here <vocnois> <iver>
i mean if we were that racist of a citi then we wouldn't be that accept to <vocnois> gai pride <ext-march> and the black out that we had on campu a few week back <iver>
with the n doubl a c p <iver>
<sil> i <vocnois> realli don't think we're incred racist <iver>
i mean i'm sure there is some <vocnois> but it's <sil> not as extrem as some place that i've been <iver>
<vocnois> birmingham alabama <laugh> <iver>
yeah <laugh> <iver>
um <vocnois> when i went i went with my friend <iver>
<sil> and <sil> we were stai at hi grandpa's and hi grandpa would sit on the back porch <ext-and> <sil> sai all kind of racial slur toward black <vocnois-peopl> <iver>
<iver>
and everyon would be all right with that <iver>
um-hum <iver>
i think so <sil> i mean there's enough open mind peopl in the countri <iver>
that i think that we would be readi <iver>
<vocnois> i mean colin powel wa pretti close if he would have ran <iver>
yeah <iver>
i'd sai it's not ani differ than have a man i mean <vocnois> it's <sil> a person <sil> she'd just have a differ wai of go about it <cutoff-clip=the> <vocnois> probabl <sil> <iver>
i'd sai probabl the black man <iver>
yeah well <sil> the white man would probabl win but the black man also <vocnois> ha a <vocnois> he ha a better chanc than the woman i think <iver>
simpli <ext-becaus> <sil> it's not too much of a chang from the statu quo <iver>
<nois> <iver>
i wa too young <iver>
no <iver>
all of hi problem have <ext-been> person problem that realli shouldn't have been touch on <vocnois> except the media got into it <sil> and <vocnois> <sil> um <vocnois> i mean we look up to the presid to be a moral man whatev but if you look at the other nation thei weren't <sil> that shock that a presid would do someth like that 
thei were wonder why we were make such a big deal out of it <sil> and <sil> pretti much <sil> all the other problem <sil> well there weren't realli too mani other problem i mean the economi's <sil> do realli <laugh-well> and <sil> foreign relat <sil> ar alwai shaki but <sil> thei're get a littl bit better <iver>
i'd probabl vote for bush <sil> over clinton <sil> <iver>
i don't think that'd chang my mind about anyth i mean <sil> i don't <sil> approv of hi immor behavior but <vocnois> it doesn't chang the wai he run the countri <iver>
i'm just more of a conserv person i mean <sil> i'm not sure exactli what hi platform is <sil> but i've seen him speak a coupl <ext-time> <sil> and <sil> i don't know he just <sil> impress me more than al gore <iver>
al gore realli doesn't entic me at all he claim he invent the internet <laugh> <iver>
all thi other stuff <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
no it'd probabl be <ext-someth> with hi foreign polici or domest polici that would chang my mind <iver>
<sil> or some kind of tax program <iver>
that would probabl affect my decis a littl bit <iver>
becaus i work with a gui that wa a cocain addict for a while <iver>
<vocnois> and <sil> he couldn't have ani kind of caffein otherwis he'd get the shake and he took all kind of pill <iver>
to help <sil> calm him down <iver>
and to learn anyth it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right <iver>
and that type of person i don't think would make a veri effect presid becaus <sil> i don't know presid need to be abl to think fast on their feet <vocnois> <iver>
that would probabl chang my decis a littl bit <vocnois> <iver>
yeah i don't think i could vote for a violent presid <sil> i could vote for a presid that made some mistak with <vocnois> their person life <iver>
gun control <sil> i'm not realli too interest in <sil> i mean you look at israel peopl ar carri gun in the street <sil> big huge <ext-gun and <sil> thei're on of the safest nation in the countri <vocnois> then you look at england thei have no gun at all and thei're <sil> rel safe <sil> so i mean <iver>
it's <sil> more our societi than the gun i believ it's more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself <iver>
gun should definit be kept in a lock box <sil> where kid can't get them <sil> besid that there's not a whole lot that <sil> govern can do it's more the parent' respons to keep the gun out of their <sil> kid' hand <sil> <iver>
no the worst thing that happen wa a wallet got stolen out of a locker <iver>
yeah <sil> pretti much <sil> <iver>
here at colleg i realli haven't wit ani violenc at all <iver>
<vocnois> i haven't seen ani fight i haven't seen anyon get shot i mean you read about it in the lantern but <vocnois> the onli thing that i wa realli shock about wa <sil> the peopl beg on high street <iver>
yeah that's realli not someth you see in worthington <iver>
well <vocnois> i agre that we should help them <sil> mayb through some sort of govern <sil> program <vocnois> <sil> but i think what realli hurt them the most is the peopl that actual give them the monei on high street becaus it realli doesn't motiv them to get out of the gutter <sil> i mean if thei can make a live off of beg chang off of colleg student thei're probabl gonna stai with that becaus it's real easi life <iver>
<sil> <iver>

when i start date at <sil> almost seventeen <vocnois> um <sil> so no i think <vocnois> i think you learn a lot from your famili <vocnois> and the wai their relationship ar <vocnois> um <vocnois> i <vocnois> i person don't think a school can do it <iver>
um <vocnois> i think thei can help <vocnois> but i think it ha to be someth that <vocnois> societi in gener or famili <iver>
unit doe it <vocnois> um and it wasn't that i had a bad famili unit it wa just that <vocnois> there wasn't yknow we never talk about it <vocnois> my <laugh-sister_and_i were just talk about that becaus <nois-we_were> <vocnois> she goe <vocnois> we were like <cutoff-w=?> <vocnois> yknow how did peopl start talk about <sil> <ext-sex> and relationship and what not she goe <vocnois> you don't <cutoff-mem=rememb> mom and dad hand me a book <vocnois> i'm like thei did <iver>

<vocnois> <iver>
like <vocnois> you mean sexual relationship and what <vocnois> um <vocnois> probabl the <cutoff-r=?> <vocnois> the bad thing about it <vocnois> yeah <vocnois> um but just come from my christian belief and what not <vocnois> the best thing and i know it <sil> even though i didn't partak in it when i wa a teenag and i wasn't promiscu at all <vocnois> but i still had sex befor marriag <vocnois> um <vocnois> just to be <vocnois> it'd be nice if thei teach you how to be confid in your self <vocnois> and i don't mean like self esteem but <vocnois> yknow like <sil> we said if if uh <vocnois> yknow you come from a situat like that that doesn't mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of <iver>
<vocnois> yeah <vocnois> <iver>
right <vocnois> well kind of like <vocnois> just becaus everybodi els is do it thi wai doesn't mean it's the right <ext-wai> <vocnois> and um <vocnois> <cutoff-i=i> yeah <vocnois> <cutoff-i=i> <vocnois> yknow i realli struggl with that <vocnois> becaus <vocnois=i> <sil> i come more from i think the famili should teach it <vocnois> but let's be realist how mani famili ar gonna do that <vocnois> or <vocnois> have the <vocnois> mental to do that <sil> it seem like um <vocnois> <laugh> <vocnois> sound like my dad <laugh-but_it_seem> like these dai <vocnois> most of the peopl a lot of peopl that ar have kid <vocnois> shouldn't be <iver>
and the peopl that <vocnois> would be decent parent aren't <vocnois> becaus of the <vocnois> situat and what not <vocnois> um just my <cutoff-fam=famili> <sil> nobodi in my <cutoff-fam=famili> my sister doesn't have kid i don't have kid <vocnois> we're in our mid to late thirti <vocnois> um our friend just had on <vocnois> um i do have some friend that have <vocnois> like more than on <vocnois> which is great <vocnois> becaus thei're just great parent i'll know those kid ar gonna be go in <vocnois> but then <sil> i have uh other peopl that <vocnois> like my other friend that just had on <vocnois> were try to help a a child <error-nin=in> children servic <vocnois> that came from <vocnois> <unknown> <iver>
<vocnois> yknow <vocnois> imagin it and that's basic what happen to her and her mom had three kid <vocnois> by three differ dad <vocnois> and thei thought if thei could get her out of that environ thei actual <vocnois> had her move in with them <vocnois> thei were her temporari foster parent <vocnois> and <vocnois> she just turn sixteen <vocnois> so she wa fifteen when she move in with them <vocnois> she refus to chang <vocnois> and <vocnois> i don't know what could have chang it if thei would have got her out earlier <vocnois> but basic <vocnois> all three of them <vocnois> i don't wanna sai ar doom but <vocnois> thei're not <sil> even though thei're out of that environ <vocnois> thei're not do ani better <iver>
so <iver>
<vocnois> i don't know <vocnois> yeah so it's kind of like <vocnois> i'm for educ in school but <sil> um <vocnois> just like the bad thing about it yknow <sil> sex can do <vocnois> you can get pregnant number on <iver>
which isn't fun <vocnois> <laugh-and> number two yknow the diseas and thing like that <vocnois> i think that's a good idea <vocnois> to teach just <sil> that it's not all <vocnois> uh fun and peer pressur and stuff i know i kind of got off track there but <vocnois> <iver>
hum <iver>
no <vocnois> becaus thei're gonna learn that on their own <vocnois> um <vocnois> <cutoff-a=i> <vocnois> i person think that it's a choic <sil> i don't think you're born that wai <vocnois> becaus <cutoff-a=i> i <vocnois> i have friend <vocnois> that ar homosexu and <vocnois> um <vocnois> yknow <cutoff-wa=?> i don't believ in what thei're do but <vocnois> <laugh-i_don't> do everyth right everydai <vocnois> so i still love them and thei're my friend and blah blah blah becaus <vocnois> but i've also known peopl that <vocnois> were that wai <vocnois> and now ar heterosexu and ar much happier <vocnois> and thei realiz that it wa just a choic thei made and thing like that <vocnois> um <vocnois> so it's <vocnois> <vocnois> in todai's dai and ag thei're gonna learn about it <vocnois> quickli <iver>
and i don't realli think it's someth that need to be taught <vocnois> um <vocnois> the onli thing <vocnois> probabl <vocnois> is like <vocnois> what do thei call that uh <vocnois> cultur divers or whatev class thei have us take i think <vocnois> that i don't think is such a bad idea <vocnois> uh becaus just becaus you grew up in <vocnois> i don't know <vocnois> what i grew up in but i'll i'll give an exampl i didn't grow up in let's sai <vocnois> somebodi goe hunt and fish and drive truck and wear ball cap and listen to countri music <vocnois> doesn't mean if somebodi doesn't do that <vocnois> thei're not okai <vocnois> i think that would be a good idea or yknow cultur all ar differ <vocnois> so if you want to view that as a cultur or <vocnois> do yknow what i mean <vocnois> that that <vocnois> is someth differ <vocnois> um <vocnois> accept the peopl you don't have to like what thei're do <vocnois> but thei're still peopl <vocnois> so <iver>
yeah <iver>
yeah <iver>
yeah <vocnois> um <vocnois> yeah <vocnois> i <vocnois> it's hard becaus i i do come <cutoff-a=across> <vocnois> i'm a christian <vocnois> so i believ that homosexu is wrong <vocnois> but <vocnois> i don't like i said i'm not gonna condemn them <vocnois> um at all <vocnois> like i said i have friend <vocnois> it <vocnois> i understand what you're sai <vocnois> um <vocnois> but i think that's someth more for <vocnois> the parent <vocnois> or the teacher to pick out <vocnois> that mayb that child <vocnois> um is have a problem and then send them to counsel of some sort <vocnois> and not actual incorpor it <sil> in a <vocnois> thirti student <vocnois> ensembl <vocnois> um <vocnois> uh it'd be nice if we had more of an open environ in school and if teacher realli had the time <vocnois> to notic that mayb somebodi had a problem and talk to them about it <vocnois> and then send them on that counsel <vocnois> on on on wai <vocnois> um <vocnois> just becaus <vocnois> if you're gonna teach it to um a larg amount of <vocnois> student <vocnois> i'm not even sure if that on <cutoff-sh=?> student would listen becaus all the rest of them <error-wund=would> probabl be make crack and just make them feel <ext-more> <vocnois> do you know what i mean <vocnois> <ext-so> i don't <cutoff-f=feel?> <iver>
<laugh> <vocnois> yeah <laugh> <iver>
<ext-so> <ext-i> yknow thei probabl all hei you resembl that remark or <laugh-ynknow> <iver>
<vocnois> <cutoff-i=i> so i hesit to sai that it would realli help them <sil> um it would just be better if somebodi could <vocnois> yknow keep their ey open <vocnois> or if we <ext-had> <vocnois> um <vocnois> more counselor or thing like that to deal with everyth <vocnois> includ that <iver>
normal i would sai no <vocnois> but <vocnois> yeah <vocnois> i do <vocnois> just becaus <vocnois> let's face it <sil> <laugh-thei're_probabl_gonna> do it anyhow <vocnois> and i would feel better for them <sil> and if <cutoff-i=if> <sil> if thei us it becaus <vocnois> uh <vocnois> yknow <sil> it's not good for the children that ar born it's not good for them <vocnois> um <vocnois> i'd prefer abstin but let's be realist <vocnois> yknow i think we're past that point now <vocnois> um i know a lot of christian argu oh but you're wrong <vocnois> well yeah i might be wrong but <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> <laugh-we> <vocnois> we can't go backward on that i don't think <vocnois> you can onli work on your own <iver>

<laugh> um <sil> not to sound like a broken record but i realli think it's <sil> our uh <vocnois> backslid on <vocnois> on famili unit <vocnois> i think it's too easi to stai <vocnois> <cutoff-i=i> and i've been marri and divorc so i've <vocnois> unfortun had that experi to me <vocnois> um <vocnois> that <vocnois> it's too easi to get divorc <vocnois> um peopl don't realli go into marriag with commit <sil> and lifetim <vocnois> and have that <sil> i don't wanna sai old fashion valu but just the valu of thi is veri import <vocnois> um becaus let face it <vocnois> to <sil> to me love is a choic <vocnois> becaus there's time when i don't love my husband i wanna smack him and he's be a littl barnei <vocnois> but i choos to be in love with him becaus i made that choic and then that pass <vocnois> and lo and behold an hour later week later what <cutoff-ha=happen> <laugh-whatev_long_it> take <vocnois> i'm in love with him again <vocnois> i mean realli <vocnois> yknow what i'm sai <vocnois> and um <vocnois> i think it's just too easi to get divorc <vocnois> i don't believ in stai in a marriag for the sake of a just children <vocnois> but i think if you realli make that commit and <vocnois> actual work on it <vocnois> you can have a great relationship you can <cutoff-h=have> have kid <vocnois> and bring them up in <sil> a more stabl environ <vocnois> um <sil> unfortun i think that's <vocnois> the problem <vocnois> parent <vocnois> um ar <sil> a either get divorc <vocnois> and then thei get caught up in their petti littl thing and start pit the kid against each other <vocnois> yknow us the kid as a medium <vocnois> um <vocnois> or <vocnois> thei're too selfish and don't listen to their kid or thei didn't <vocnois> i <vocnois> i don't wanna sai selfish but let face it like we said yknow even have a dog take some time out of your <cutoff-s=schedul> <sil> your <cutoff-s=schedul> <vocnois> your schedul <vocnois> and um <vocnois> not spend enough time with the kid <vocnois> yknow thei're work what not <sil> and it take a lot of effort <vocnois> to rais kid these dai and actual listen to them and get to know them <vocnois> and let them grow and thing like that <vocnois> uh <vocnois> and i don't think <sil> enough <sil> famili ar do that <iver>

<nois-um> <iver>
um-hum <iver>
um-hum <iver>
<vocnois> um <sil> actual <sil> <vocnois> <sil> i wa over there when all of that happen but of cours it wa <sil> <vocnois> all over the paper and <vocnois> yknow <sil> i think <sil> i mean i <ext-i'd> i don't know what it wa like realli here i can imagin but <vocnois> i mean there especi thei realli focus on <sil> um <sil> not columbin but <sil> the on with the <sil> the younger kid in arkansa <vocnois> wa it <sil> the year befor i wa there for <sil> both of those but <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> in the first on yknow thei thei put the pictur of the littl kid in combat gear <cutoff-ho=hold> hold the gun <sil> everywher and <vocnois> columbin <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> yknow <sil> <vocnois> everi paper had a slightli differ slant on the stori and <vocnois> yknow their fact were all over the place but that's anoth <vocnois> kind of issu but <vocnois> um <sil> what i think caus it i mean <sil> i don't know i think that <sil> like <sil> more should've been made of the fact of <vocnois> yknow thi <sil> like <sil> terribl <vocnois> sort of <sil> resent for the other student and <sil> and <vocnois> yknow i'm not in ani wai defend <sil> the gui who did it but <vocnois> um <sil> yknow <vocnois> someth <sil> is wrong <sil> not onli with them but in the fact that thei were like driven to that point where thei felt so hate and so malign or whatev <vocnois> that <sil> yknow that you would even <sil> think of do someth like that <sil> um <sil> i don't know especi with <vocnois> yknow everyth that wa said about the famili and <sil> yknow thei didn't seem to <vocnois> of cours you never realli know but thei didn't seem to have grown up in thi yknow terribl environ and <vocnois> yknow have that sort of <vocnois> yknow <sil> precondit or anyth like that <vocnois> um <sil> yeah i think <cutoff-i=it> <sil> a lot more effort <sil> need to be made <vocnois> yknow to sort of <vocnois> yknow placat those sort of situat and <vocnois> i mean <sil> who doe it is sort of anoth question becaus <vocnois> yknow the teacher alreadi <sil> ar over work and underpaid and <sil> yknow <vocnois> all those kind of thing but <vocnois> i don't know <iver>
right <iver>
right <sil> right <iver>
well i do think access is too easi but it's sort of <vocnois> like anyth els i think if law were pass <sil> the peopl who were <sil> against it would be so <sil> yknow <sil> just besid themselv that it would <vocnois> i don't know for how long but i think it would make <sil> the situat <sil> not with <cutoff-th=the> <sil> the shoot and thing like that but i think it would make <sil> the <sil> just the gun situat probabl <cutoff-m=?> <sil> much wors for a while becaus peopl would be <vocnois> yknow <sil> do <sil> illeg thing to get gun and that sort of thing <vocnois> but <sil> i mean too mani peopl have gun here <sil> there's too much of a <vocnois> in my opinion yknow there's too much of a gun cultur <vocnois> i mean over there <sil> thei've <sil> pretti much <sil> <vocnois> outlaw gun except for hunt and thing and the fact that <cutoff-y=you> <sil> yknow of cours there ar some float around but the fact that you can pretti much successfulli do that <sil> obvious england's such a small countri in comparison but <vocnois> i mean that's just amaz to me <sil> and <vocnois> but it's true i mean the fact that <sil> <vocnois> yknow the access is just <vocnois> there's <vocnois> <sil> almost noth bar and i mean <sil> just the amount of peopl that i just hear sort of <vocnois> yknow in convers talk about oh yeah i <sil> yknow <vocnois> get a gun for secur and all thi stuff it's like <sil> yknow <sil> <ext-what> your chanc of <vocnois> number on need it <sil> and <vocnois> number two <sil> if you were in that just minut <vocnois> percentag of <sil> yknow <sil> happen chanc that you would need it the fact that <vocnois> if you us it to shoot someon who wasn't yknow i <ext-mean> <sil> <vocnois> everyth is against you <vocnois> <iver>
yknow <vocnois> <iver>
yeah exactli and it's just <vocnois> it's just ridicul but so mani peopl don't seem to think that wai and <vocnois> i do think <vocnois> yeah access <sil> it would help if access <sil> were restrict <vocnois> <sil> or <vocnois> at least if thei were more <sil> care about it i mean it seem like even <vocnois> the law that there ar in place now aren't necessarili follow and <sil> yknow that kind of thing <iver>
but the whole <vocnois> it <sil> especi with the first <vocnois> few shoot yknow with the children's <vocnois> i mean <iver>
yknow thei shouldn't know where the kei ar if there were kei to the gun cabinet or whatev i mean the fact that <vocnois> a yknow how do you explain your wai out of <sil> your kid take gun to school <iver>
right <iver>
oh were thei were alreadi in the garag did thei not bui them themselv <iver>
oh right <iver>
oh right <iver>
right <iver>
right <vocnois> right <sil> well it's sort of a problem as well the <sil> yknow <sil> doe <sil> <vocnois> <sil> i mean uh it's seem <vocnois> yknow from what i've read it <sil> if you want to make a bomb it's fairli <cutoff-un=uncompl> <sil> uncompl <sil> yknow so <vocnois> that's <iver>
right <vocnois> um <sil> at the ag that thei were <iver>
i don't know <sil> i <sil> i wouldn't <sil> person like think that the parent should be held respons <vocnois> i mean thei do have <vocnois> yknow a certain amount of respons for the fact that thei should've been more awar and <sil> and especi becaus <vocnois> i mean i believ that those <vocnois> or at least on of the two had been in <vocnois> counsel and <vocnois> had to <sil> yknow wa do it <sil> <vocnois> aggress manag or someth like that <vocnois> um <sil> yknow you would think <sil> that <sil> if thei were go through someth like that <vocnois> you would just sort of <sil> yknow mayb keep a closer ey on <sil> what thei were do so i think <vocnois> yknow <sil> to that degre <sil> yknow the parent should've <sil> um <vocnois> yknow <sil> um <sil> wors <vocnois> sort of respons <sil> and also <vocnois> with like their kid disposit i mean <vocnois> yknow <sil> would you not notic some differ if someth like that wa go to happen i mean depend on <sil> a <sil> yknow how well thei hid it or whatev but <vocnois> um <vocnois> i think at that point though you're <sil> you're so influenc by your peer <iver>
that like <he-uh> <sil> the parent influenc isn't as much as <sil> yknow befor then i think by the time that you ar past adolesc <iver>
um-hum <iver>
right <iver>
i know <iver>
um <sil> well like i said befor i think <sil> i don't know i think screen would be veri difficult <sil> i mean <vocnois> especi <sil> becaus at that ag you're gonna have a lot of peopl who ar <sil> yknow peopl sai thing to sai thing and to get a reaction and <vocnois> to tell their friend that <sil> thei said i mean <vocnois> yknow <sil> thei can plai off <sil> whatev and unless thei were <vocnois> yknow 
<sil> highli <sil> skill or train in that area i mean <sil> you can't realli do a simpl sort of screen and <sil> these ar good and these ar bad uh and <vocnois> again as i mention previous <sil> i think it's more to do with <vocnois> mayb be awar of the interact <sil> of <sil> yknow the differ student with each other and <vocnois> i mean if it wa as bad as <sil> thei claim it to be or as it appear to be and <vocnois> i mean you're you're never go to get rid of all of that becaus there ar alwai differ group and differ cliqu but <sil> i can't help but think that if it wa bad enough that you would <sil> do someth like that <vocnois> that <sil> yknow <sil> had to have been more than just <sil> yknow sort of <sil> normal <sil> jock versu <sil> whatev <sil> so i think it should be more <vocnois> i don't know <sil> i mean even <sil> yknow i went to a <sil> privat <sil> cathol highschool <sil> but <vocnois> even there yknow there wa <sil> yknow uh <sil> a sens of that and i mean some of the thing that went on <vocnois> should definit not have been go on and that wa <vocnois> <sil> onli on a veri small level there were eighti six peopl in my graduat class yknow and i mean <sil> thi is a highschool with like sever hundr student that thi happen at so <iver>
um-hum <iver>
um-hum <vocnois> i think in fifth grade <sil> wa the first <iver>
um <sil> i mean at that point <sil> i uh <sil> i certainli didn't have <sil> ani uh <sil> real <vocnois> knowledg <laugh-about_ani> of that sort of thing <vocnois> um <vocnois> yknow thei cover <vocnois> the basic <sil> <ext-um> <sil> thei did talk about condom and <vocnois> um contracept <vocnois> i rememb we <vocnois> watch a film <sil> which everyon wa veri embarrass by <sil> um <vocnois> i mean i don't realli <vocnois> <sil> uh thei uh thei did send home a packet to the parent <vocnois> becaus i rememb be realli upset and not want my mom <laugh-to_talk_with_me_about_it> <iver>
<vocnois> um <sil> but <vocnois> yknow i think what thei did wa <sil> fairli good thei didn't realli <vocnois> as far as i rememb at that point at least thei didn't <sil> well thei must have done gone into the sort of moral issu <vocnois> um <sil> but it i <sil> what i rememb wa more of a scientif approach <iver>
um-hum <iver>
right <iver>
all i rememb is <sil> them talk about condom i don't think thei talk about <sil> anyth besid that <vocnois> but <vocnois> um <sil> then again <vocnois> i could <laugh-be_rememb_wrong> <vocnois> um but ye that <he-i> mean <vocnois> it is the stanc but i think <vocnois> in the school <sil> i mean that's sort of like the the hard line of the cathol church but in the more progress school thei're a littl bit more realist <sil> i mean thi wasn't <sil> i mean it wa a cathol school but we didn't have nun or anyth there i mean <vocnois> um <vocnois> yknow i think <sil> thei were sort of <sil> more concern with <sil> yknow <sil> it it actual it might have been later than the first <vocnois> um <vocnois> sex educ we had that young i mean it might have been more like a <error-coup-ah=coupl> <vocnois> like eight grade that thei talk about condom <sil> i doubt that thei would've done that that earli now that i think about it <vocnois> but i know that there wa at on point <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> some sort of <iver>
um-hum <iver>
um <sil> <vocnois> <sil> not realli <vocnois> <sil> becaus i think <sil> yknow <sil> <ext-if> <sil> if thei're go to <sil> thei're go to and <sil> i don't think <sil> a lot of them at <sil> that stage ar gonna go out of their wai to go <vocnois> <sil> and bui them so i don't think it's like <sil> oh i have a condom i'm go to have sex <vocnois> <sil> i mean actual it's <sil> thi <vocnois> is is veri hot topic in england right now becaus thei thei've got <sil> the highest rate <sil> of teenag pregnanc in the world <vocnois> and i mean there ar stori everywher about <sil> yknow twelv year old have babi and <vocnois> i mean there thei've gone to distribut <sil> condom on playground which i do think is <sil> a littl bit <vocnois> too much i think mayb have them avail in the nurs offic is on thing <vocnois> thei're there <vocnois> yknow <sil> thei can go and <sil> and <sil> get some or someth but i think actual like physic <vocnois> yknow pass them out is a bad idea <vocnois> <sil> but demonstr and that kind of thing i think is pretti import just <vocnois> <sil> yknow uh <sil> becaus of the simpl fact of the statist that thei're thei ar do it so <sil> at least <sil> at the veri least thei might as well be <vocnois> yknow safe about it <iver>
um <sil> well actual <sil> it's <sil> sort of all happen in a certain area <vocnois> <sil> yknow with <sil> yknow veri high unemploy like council <vocnois> council state <vocnois> um <sil> yknow <sil> the sort of stereotyp yknow kind of bad famili environ <sil> yknow <sil> parent have lot of <sil> boyfriend and girlfriend drug everyth els and <vocnois> yknow a lot of these <vocnois> girl that have been interview <sil> yknow sai oh yknow i want someth to love or <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> we were bore so we decid to have sex and i mean i find it just total appal <sil> and <sil> yknow a thirteen year old boi who wa interview wa sai <vocnois> oh yknow he had <sil> yknow <vocnois> slept with like <sil> ten girl or someth and <sil> i'm think <sil> oh my gosh yknow and he's thirteen and <vocnois> yknow had a few kid and <vocnois> that wa it but <vocnois> in my opinion the main problem there is <vocnois> thei get more support <sil> even at that ag <sil> when thei have <sil> thei <sil> yknow thei get unemploy becaus onc thei've had a kid even if thei're not <vocnois> of work ag thei get like a <sil> an a certain amount of monei and then onc thei reach i think <cutoff-f=fifteen> <sil> um fifteen or sixteen <vocnois> if thei have a babi thei're provid thei're <cutoff-li=like?> <sil> the top of the list for a council hous <vocnois> so thei get their own there wa actual a <sil> long documentari on befor i left <vocnois> um <vocnois> yknow of thi girl who wa constantli fight with her parent <vocnois> and <vocnois> yknow her parent were at the end of their rope <vocnois> she got pregnant and she wa like well <vocnois> yknow hei <sil> thi is my ticket to move out becaus she get her own place she get <sil> monei for herself monei for the babi she doesn't have to pai ani util or anyth <vocnois> and <sil> yknow <sil> what more <vocnois> could she want <sil> yknow wa basic what she wa sai <sil> i've got my own place i can do whatev i want i'm get monei and i don't have to work <vocnois> and <sil> and so <sil> <vocnois> that i think is a veri bad situat becaus thei're almost reward for <sil> yknow <iver>

right <iver>
right <iver>
i think that's great <sil> yknow i think <sil> obvious <vocnois> there's alwai <sil> a down side and <sil> but <sil> i think that <sil> too mani peopl abus the system <vocnois> and <vocnois> yknow <sil> unfortun <sil> it's <sil> veri hard when <sil> yknow <sil> then it ruin it for the peopl who realli do need it <sil> and but <vocnois> yknow as long as thei have <vocnois> yknow creat <sil> a system <sil> wherebi <sil> yknow it won't be <vocnois> obvious as good for those peopl <vocnois> as it ha been the on who ar genuin unemploy but <vocnois> yknow <sil> i think <sil> depend on how <sil> um <vocnois> sort of focus thei ar on <vocnois> the individu in their area or whatev howev it's divid up <vocnois> i don't know hopefulli <sil> not special treatment but obvious you would try to steer them more in <sil> whichev direct thei're most suit for <vocnois> yknow as <error-fall=far> <vocnois> far as mayb like the volunt work becaus i mean <vocnois> yknow there is so much volunt to be done <sil> everywher and even if you don't have <vocnois> yknow <sil> if you're lack in <vocnois> whatev wai <vocnois> <sil> <ext-you'd> think that you can <sil> yknow there is someth <vocnois> yknow hopefulli that <vocnois> <sil> i don't know <iver>
um-hum <vocnois> um-hum <iver>
actual thei're thei ar work on it i'm sorri i didn't mean to interrupt you uh <vocnois> um <sil> thei've <vocnois> <sil> thei've um just instat some bonu scheme where <vocnois> as <sil> the poverti <cutoff-lete=level> <sil> level i think is consid um <sil> thirteen <sil> thousand pound a year <vocnois> um <sil> and if <vocnois> if you're below the poverti level and you do go back to work you get a certain like <sil> extra <sil> bonu <vocnois> beyond <vocnois> yeah so there's a bonu for back to work <vocnois> you mention earlier about like how thi would effect the children with thi two year welfar thing <vocnois> i mean at least <vocnois> i know a lot more about <sil> the system there for <sil> <laugh-for_whatev> reason than i do about the system here which is kind of unfortun but <vocnois> um <vocnois> there i mean <sil> i don't realli think <sil> and a lot of situat <vocnois> of cours <sil> i i'm sure there ar peopl who follow it <vocnois> as it should be and who <sil> who realli need it and who realli <vocnois> yknow take care of their children but unfortun you don't realli see that side veri much you see the peopl who like <vocnois> their kid see none of that monei <sil> yknow thei're left at home by themselv <sil> if <vocnois> if thei can even <vocnois> yknow get them to school if thei even go to school if thei're even bother yknow <sil> and <vocnois> <sil> yknow those <sil> yknow a lot of there's there <cutoff-doc=documentari> documentari on all the time there so you realli <sil> it's sort of <cutoff-s=?> <sil> it's more in your face than it is here at <sil> that i ever notic um <vocnois> but i do think <sil> and and <sil> with that thei have specif program for the children and <vocnois> um <vocnois> i think on of the problem too with the school is the fact that yknow <vocnois> if a <sil> if a kid ha bad behavior or <vocnois> yknow bad attend that you send them home i mean i think that's the most ridicul thing like sure that's <sil> not a punish for a lot of these kid <vocnois> and <vocnois> yknow <sil> at least in england <vocnois> on these thing i've seen yknow thei send them home and these kid ar just <sil> do whatev <vocnois> go around the neighborhood shoplift bulli <sil> yknow hotwir car at the ag of yknow ten or someth and <vocnois> i don't know i think <sil> i do have <laugh-sort_of_veri_strong_opinion> about <sil> peopl <vocnois> yeah who <vocnois> ar have all these kid and don't take care of them <sil> at all <iver>

<iver>
<iver>
oh it can be yeah <iver>
yeah there ar there ar time when it all just <sil> there's a uh group over there call star check <iver>
and thei fly check <sil> like <sil> if you write a check todai and you deposit at the bank <sil> well that check ha to go from your bank <sil> to clearinghous <sil> and that's all thei do all night long <iver>
right tuesdai wednesdai and thursdai <sil> everi night <iver>
so like thirti of them will <sil> go out at on time and thirti will come back well that isn't too bad <sil> but thei're mix in with <sil> everybodi els that's normal fly like all the airlin and stuff so and thei want to get there a s a p so <sil> yknow <sil> i <sil> i just don't <sil> feel comfort do <sil> that much at on time i mean not that <sil> o s u is not a wa not a a dead place yknow it wa veri busi it's like the third busiest in ohio <sil> but uh yeah it's amaz and thei're onli open sixteen hour a dai <iver>
so yknow <sil> um <sil> it it's pretti <sil> pretti busi there but <sil> it <sil> it's <cutoff-sp=spread> spread out over the sixteen hour is where as port columbu sometim you have like mayb seventi five eighti airplan <sil> in an hour time <sil> so <iver>
uh well we have an <sil> upstair and downstair upstair is the tower and there's like a uh ground control <sil> <vocnois> a clearanc <error-levri=level_read> which read all the clearanc all the airplan and the ground control taxi them to and from the runwai and the tower work <sil> everybodi <sil> land and depart <sil> or ani airplan within five mile radiu <sil> then onc thei get out of that <sil> radiu downstair which is call the approach control thei work <sil> everyth from there <sil> to ten thousand feet <sil> and out to about sixti mile <sil> and when thei get to that point then thei go to the en rout center <iver>
so <sil> yknow <vocnois> downstair there's five differ sector so thei split the uh <sil> area up into five differ area <sil> and uh yknow there ar some <sil> sector down there that get <sil> extrem busi and then sometim it's just like yknow you're just twiddl your thumb it's <sil> uh it's like feast or famin <sil> yknow it's not like steadi like if you're <sil> work at meijer run the cash regist it's just kind of like steadi it's like you look at <sil> yknow you <cutoff-s=sit> <unknown> <cutoff-s=so?> you'd be like sit at meijer and there's <vocnois> no on in your line <sil> and then you turn your back and turn back around and there's like seventi five <iver>
wait <sil> and thei all want to go right now <sil> yknow and that's how most airplan ar yknow thei all thei don't think about anybodi els thei think <sil> i'm here why um <sil> why aren't i first <sil> yknow so <sil> <iver>
<iver>
<iver>
right <iver>
uh well the problem is is um <sil> like sai <sil> everi airlin want to go to new york citi and thei want all their busi men there at eight a m <sil> well <sil> an airport ha <sil> so mani runwai <sil> and so mani taxi wai <sil> and yknow like sai <sil> ten airplan <sil> everi ten minut can come in and out <sil> of those airport <sil> well <vocnois> thei <sil> end up shoot like thirti there <sil> so <sil> instead of let them all get in the air <sil> and stai up there and hold while thei're <error-foo_uh_fi=fire_shoot> uh yknow shoot them in what thei do is thei uh <sil> like uh sai go to o'hare thei'll <sil> you hafta call for releas time at these differ airport <sil> and thei will sai well uh <sil> he can't go right now but he can go like at <sil> twenti seven past the hour <sil> so he thei know by look at the entir pictur and how mani airplan ar come to that airport <sil> when he will fit in <sil> so it's not so much <sil> air traffic delai it's <sil> airlin that caus it themself it's like uh yknow like <sil> you and i and five hundr peopl want to get to thi room <sil> at ten o'clock todai <sil> well rather than sai <sil> why don't some of you come at ten <sil> and anoth group come at ten fifteen anoth group <sil> <unknown> and we're <sil> all try to do the same thing at onc and it doesn't work yknow you <sil> you can't get <unknown> you can onli get so mani peopl through that door <sil> and if you sai well i'm gonna take five at a time <sil> well thei can get in but if you sai i'm take five hundr at time <sil> it doesn't work and <sil> so the <cutoff-airpla=airplan> <sil> airlin alwai go well it's the govern <sil> and regul and blah blah blah that's <sil> why we're delai and it's realli them themselv <vocnois> becaus thei're <iver>

<iver>
<sil> so that i think that's a problem too yknow everybodi sai well i don't want to get there at eight thirti <sil> yknow so <iver>
yeah <sil> the on thing thei've done is thei've <sil> put on bigger airplan <sil> becaus it us to be yknow you <sil> like a uh <sil> sai uh <sil> seven thirti seven would go from here to new york citi and now it's a seven fifti seven so that add more seat <sil> so instead of <sil> becaus i <cutoff-wo=would> when i first got there i couldn't understand <sil> at o s u <sil> when it wa like <sil> christma time or someth it wa just <sil> you'd drive up and the park lot wa just full of car and you're like oh boi <laugh> <iver>
gonna be a realli busi dai <sil> and i would <sil> the same thing at port columbu yknow i <sil> i'd see <sil> all these car but it would be just about the same traffic and i'm like <sil> and i mention somebodi i go <sil> where ar the extra airplan and thei go thei can't add extra airplan <sil> it's <sil> thei have certain rout thei can do thei just hafta <cutoff-b=be> <sil> put <sil> bigger airplan on <sil> so he said <sil> yknow you'll see larger airplan when it's <sil> holidai time so thei can <sil> put more peopl on <sil> so <iver>

until thei start <sil> get <sil> a littl bit better equip becaus the equip is realli ancient i mean there's stuff there that's older than i am <laugh-yknow> <laugh> <sil> so but thei like uh port columbu is get a new tower <sil> and thei're it's suppos be done in about three and a half year and the equip thei're get is <sil> all brand new stuff it's not like thei're take all the old junk we've got <sil> and move it over there so <sil> yknow that will help and <sil> and <vocnois> <sil> nationwid thei're also put new stuff in but the bad part is is <sil> um <sil> pictur your father <sil> is your father comput liter <sil> okai <sil> he's <sil> he's at hi job and tomorrow morn thei come in and thei go <sil> everybodi's gonna put <sil> all their work <sil> on comput <sil> well <sil> <iver>
<sil> hi speed wa like sai <sil> seventi mile an hour befor and now it's gonna be <sil> twenti <sil> becaus he doesn't know how to do it and that's the problem thei're run into thei have all these qualifi peopl who know how to separ airplan and how to get them in <sil> trail and <sil> yknow everyth <sil> but now thei've gotta do thi <sil> extra part <sil> which is go to make their job easier <sil> down the road <sil> but everybodi hate chang <sil> so what thei're do now is <sil> it <sil> thei're have problem becaus <sil> peopl can't take the volum of airplan becaus thei're try to keep up with the comput so it's make it even slower yet but onc thei get in <sil> yknow in the swing of thing it'll be okai but <sil> yknow you're <sil> you're talk a while yknow becaus it's not someth that you can do overnight but it'd be like your dad learn the comput he's not go to do it overnight <iver>
and <iver>
right and if he <unknown> <sil> if he's open mind enough to do it <sil> eventu he'll see the light and sai <sil> boi thi would make it a lot easier but <sil> there ar peopl who ar like <sil> i will not <sil> do thi <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> so <sil> those the on that <sil> hafta be drug scream and kick <iver>
<iver>

<sil> sometim <sil> it's even easier to understand them becaus their thei enunci so well <sil> but uh yknow <sil> it that's someth we've never understood yknow if we can <sil> fake that accent <iver>
why can't thei fake our to make it easier for <sil> us to understand but <sil> yknow <sil> but no usual there's no problem <sil> the onli problem you usual have is like somebodi like yourself <sil> who ha never flown <sil> and is take lesson <sil> and you <sil> you have about ten or fifteen hour <sil> and we tell you to do someth and you like <sil> um <sil> well <sil> i think i know what thei mean so i'll just keep fly and it that's the worst thing you can do the best thing to do is sai <sil> okai <sil> i heard what you said <sil> but i'm brand new at thi and i've got no idea what you mean can you try it again and thei'll go okai now we know where you're come from <sil> and thei'll make it realli easi for you becaus if thei just yknow <unknown> <sil> yknow zoom out some phraseolog and you go <sil> nine eight juliet which is <sil> the <sil> <cutoff-wh=what> how you respond with a call sign the airplan <iver>

<laugh> <iver>
em <vocnois> aw that's nice <vocnois> yeah i'm sure <vocnois> <iver>
right <iver>
i think sometim you there's a tradeoff between <vocnois> time and monei and you just have to look at it and sai which is realli more import <iver>
absolut <iver>
um-hum <iver>
<vocnois> i know that thei chang it i know that it us to just be on dai i guess becaus of the healthcar <vocnois> someth like that <he-i> <he-i> i feel like <vocnois> <sil> a dai and a half certainli would be long enough for me i mean unless there's some type of complic <he-i> <vocnois> <vocnois> i would be <laugh-perfectli_readi_to_go_home> <vocnois> <vocnois> yknow <cutoff-unl=unless> unless there's someth extra that thei could do for me there <iver>
and <he-and> then i would expect that if there wa a problem that thei would make sure <cutoff-tha=that> that thei kept me there but i think a dai and a half is perfectli reason <vocnois> i mean i <he-don't> <sil> i don't <cutoff-n=know> <sil> i don't know i've never done thi <laugh-befor_so> i can't realli sai <vocnois> but i mean <vocnois> my feel is <vocnois> <sil> the least <laugh-amount_of_time> i have to be in the hospit <laugh-the_happier_i'm_gonna_be> <iver>

yeah that's true well we <cutoff-wen=went> o s u's and thei've got a nice facil i mean thei have uh <vocnois> uh <cutoff-d=?> uh <cutoff-wv=?> <sil> like a labor and deliveri room it's got like <vocnois> it's weird though becaus when you go thei show you thei thei talk about all thi whirlpool bath thing a room with it i don't know if you've heard those commerci or not <vocnois> <sil> but <cutoff-there=there's> <vocnois> <sil> there's onli on room that's like that <iver>
and it's <sil> interest that thei <sil> advertis that when you go there though <vocnois> if you get that room that's what you get <iver>
if not you just get the <cutoff-re=regular> <vocnois> the regular room ar still nice and thei have shower and stuff <vocnois> but it's <sil> interest becaus the wai thei advertis it thei make it sound like <vocnois> there's thi huge place and you're gonna get that no matter <ext-what> and thi and that <vocnois> but when you actual go and look around it kind of <vocnois> <iver>
littl differ <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
<cutoff-it=it> <iver>
yeah it's well basic it's like a <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> it's about the size of a <error-s=small> veri small hotel room and then it's got a separ bathroom with like a big bathtub <vocnois> and there's like <he-a> thei there like oh it's aroma therapi which is a littl box on the wall about thi big that ha like some smelli stuff come out of it <vocnois> but <sil> i mean there's enough room where peopl can come and sit down there's like a fold out <vocnois> couch bed for whoever's in there with you and then thei've got the babi <vocnois> thei keep the babi right there in the room with you after it's born <iver>

that kind of stuff <vocnois> so it wa mostli <cutoff-th=?> like <vocnois> <sil> what we would do is we would talk about <vocnois> we'd talk about like <ext-medic> like as far as while you're in labor <iver>
uh breast feed <vocnois> there wa a lot of that <vocnois> i could tell these poor gui ar like uh <vocnois> <laugh-can_we_not_talk_about_thi> yknow thei were all kind of uncomfort <vocnois> <sil> um <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
and then <vocnois> like let see <cutoff-w=?> <sil> a lot of it wa <he-i> mean <vocnois> most of it wa <vocnois> <sil> wa <cutoff-y=yknow> like <vocnois> pre <ext-labor> and then there wa the breath that we did at the end but other than the video <vocnois> <sil> it wa mostli like labor relat <iver>
thei tie it with <vocnois> it wa all veri pro breast <cutoff-fee=feed> you could tell you could realli tell that thei had an opinion about thi <vocnois> <sil> um <vocnois> we talk about posit and neg of breast feed thing about <vocnois> um <cutoff-he=he> like the immun <cutoff-syst=system> some of that stuff i alreadi knew <vocnois> <iver>

ar you <ext-sure> <he-i> <iver>
i wa <iver>
<vocnois> right <iver>
and that's the wai i felt about it <he-not> i'm not sai that that's not a possibl but <iver>
<sil> for someon to actual state <sil> in a class <vocnois> <sil> if you breast feed your babi thei're gonna have a higher i q than if you don't <vocnois> <sil> i <he-thought> <vocnois> <iver>
um-hum the bond <iver>

<vocnois> right and i think that yknow i think that it's just becaus yknow <he-you> <sil> do so becaus i know i've done studi and i took some of those class and you just think about it that wai <vocnois> and i think a lot of these peopl just <vocnois> yknow thei <he-sai> <vocnois> the nurs sai someth you take everyth for a fact and i thought that wa kinda strang but i mean <vocnois> i think there's a lot of thing that ar probabl posit enough about it that it <vocnois> i would want to do it for <vocnois> for a while as long as i could <iver>
but <vocnois> i don't know <vocnois> <iver>
realli <iver>

<vocnois> i <ext-rememb> it be <vocnois> it's a pretti posit thing for me i wa never upset about the fact that thei weren't togeth <vocnois> becaus thei all <vocnois> both gave me a lot of attent <vocnois> but um <vocnois> <ext-about> <vocnois> i think i <ext-wa> mayb five or six my mom move into apart in german villag <iver>
and we stai there for a while and then <vocnois> <sil> she met my step <ext-dad> <vocnois> <sil> when i wa about <vocnois> like six year old i think and then thei move up <vocnois> uh to clintonvil <sil> about when i wa about eight <sil> now my dad live up in clintonvil too <sil> so <iver>

so that wa real nice and i wa her maid of honor when thei got <laugh-marri_it_wa_just_it_wa_well_of_cours_about_thi_big_but> <iver>

um-hum <iver>
um-hum <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> um <vocnois> i think that <vocnois> <vocnois> i don't think that divorc is a bad thing <vocnois> i think that <sil> <cutoff-it=it's> <sil> it's <vocnois> <sil> if you're marri <vocnois> and <ext-you> <sil> realiz that you get to a point where you and thi other person <vocnois> <ext-ar> ar not in a posit relationship for each other or for anybodi els in your famili <vocnois> that it's better to just sai <vocnois> look thi is not <laugh-work> <vocnois> we both deserv to be happi and we <cutoff-de=deserv> <he-and> <he-and> <vocnois> and <vocnois> go your own <laugh-separ> wai <vocnois> <sil> um <vocnois> i think that <vocnois> <he-i> <sil> i think for me person <sil> i would certainli <sil> i would certainli try veri hard to be in a situat where i wouldn't <vocnois> end up get divorc <vocnois> just becaus i think it make thing a littl bit more difficult as far as like coordin <laugh-thing> and i know that sound kinda petti <vocnois> but just <vocnois> um <vocnois> <he-but> <sil> <he-i> <sil> <he-i> <he-i> <sil> i mean i don't think it's i don't think it's bad but i think that that if you can find a wai obvious <vocnois> to continu to <he-make> a relationship work that you should but my parent ar veri differ <iver>
yknow there's thing about <he-the> <vocnois> my dad that <vocnois> and i wouldn't want to live with <sil> <laugh> <vocnois> uh he's great and he's wonder to me i mean <vocnois> my dad is realli wonder to me <vocnois> but <sil> i mean thing like <vocnois> like when my mom had me <he-he> he didn't pick her up from the hospit <sil> i mean it's that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you think <iver>
yknow <vocnois> like i said he's great to me and and everyth <vocnois> but i wouldn't <sil> i wouldn't want to be marri to him <iver>
<laugh-yknow_i_certainli> wouldn't and would i expect my mom to stai with <sil> with that in that kind of a situat <vocnois> no wai i would want her to be happi <vocnois> and i would want my dad to be happi also <vocnois> so ultim for that situat <he-i> think it wa much better <vocnois> um <vocnois> thei got marri kind of young too yknow and i think that <vocnois> i think that mayb just jump into a situat you need to be <cutoff-m=more> a littl bit more care <sil> <vocnois> i know that <vocnois> that now it's a lot differ than it us to be <vocnois> peopl would get marri and <he-uh> thei'd just be expect to stai togeth and there's a lot of peopl that have been marri <vocnois> for a realli long time and thei're miser <vocnois> <iver>
yknow <he-and> <vocnois> what's the point of stai marri and be miser i think it's better to get a divorc than <iver>
than to do that <vocnois> <iver>
see <iver>
i don't agre with that at all <vocnois> i think if your parent ar unhappi togeth <sil> onli thing that's gonna happen is it's gonna trickl down and you're gonna have to listen to them be miser <vocnois> <he-and> and i think it's much more posit to have two famili <vocnois> that ar happi than on famili that's miser and thei fight and then you feel like it's your yknow peopl sai it's a my fault becaus thi happen <vocnois> yknow <sil> and i think for me it wa easier that thei split up when i wa younger <vocnois> then <he-i> <sil> i can't imagin be a teenag <sil> and have my parent split up i think that that would be <sil> probabl veri difficult <vocnois> um <sil> so i don't <cutoff-ne=know> that's a total differ perspect <he-just> to look at it from from that point of view just becaus i wa a lot younger <iver>
<laugh-no_that's> not what i mean <vocnois> no i <he-don't> i don't mean it that wai but i just mean <vocnois> i think <error-it=it's> i think it's better that if peopl ar <cutoff-g=get> <he-ar> get to a point where thei can't work it out i mean i think that <vocnois> that a lot of time you can do thing like counsel and those type of thing and <vocnois> and mayb there is some wai to work it out <iver>
but i mean if you get to the point <he-where> you where there isn't then you just have to <vocnois> i don't know i think you have to be in the situat in my situat i think for my parent <vocnois> it's better that thei split up becaus thei're both veri happi now <vocnois> <iver>
mm <iver>
um-hum <sil> um-hum but i don't know if that's <vocnois> i think that the divorc rate ha gone up becaus it's more social accept i'm sure there's plenti of peopl twenti year ago that would have love to have <laugh-gotten_a_divorc> <vocnois> had that been an option <vocnois> um <sil> <he-i> i think it just <he-i> think a lot of it is just depend on the wai you handl it <sil> yknow how you <vocnois> how you handl it after after the <he-the> divorc is final i mean not <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> <sil> do you see <cutoff-wha=what> doe that make ani sens at all <vocnois> <iver>
yeah <iver>
yeah i mean <he-i> <vocnois> it is <he-it's> <he-it's> <he-it's> <vocnois> <vocnois> it's a touch <sil> i think it's <he-i> think it's tough and i think it's realli an individu basi <sil> but i wouldn't <sil> i would sai that there's a lot of <vocnois> <sil> other thing that ar <vocnois> <cutoff-th=that> that would contribut more to <he-ani> <he-societ> problem than divorc i realli don't think that that would be the main <iver>
becaus <sil> <vocnois> um <vocnois> i think the fact that thing like <cutoff-ih=?> respons mayb a long time ago <vocnois> peopl stai <vocnois> marri becaus thei felt like thei had a respons to take care of <he-of> <vocnois> their famili i mean and you can be divorc and still take <laugh-care> of your famili <vocnois> instead of <vocnois> <sil> uh yknow <cutoff-m=?> <sil> thing as far as peopl get pregnant and <he-and> then thi person goe off <he-and> and leav and you've got a lot of unmarri <vocnois> singl women that ar all by themselv and <vocnois> and <vocnois> it's just it's more social accept to <sil> to be abl to do these thing now then i think it wa a long time ago i mean <vocnois> peopl' famili wouldn't would never stand for someth like that thei'd sai look you need to take care of thi you need to deal with thi and now it's just <vocnois> <sil> it's kind of normal and everybodi just kinda goe along with it <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
hum <vocnois> <iver>
yeah <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
see <cutoff-i=it?> well if it doesn't if it doesn't work than i can <vocnois> <sil> well that's what my best friend ami said i'll get marri and hell if it doesn't work i'll just get divorc <sil> <vocnois> <laugh-i> <vocnois> <laugh-that's_a_great_attitud_to_have_ami> <vocnois> but i mean <vocnois> <iver>
<laugh> <laugh-yeah_realli> <vocnois> i don't know i mean <he-i> guess for me <he-i> <sil> i just <vocnois> <sil> i just think jason and i get along so well <vocnois> <sil> yknow and <cutoff-w=we've> and we've been togeth for about two year and <vocnois> i <he-mean> <vocnois> <he-i> <vocnois> i don't know i just <he-i> do i just <he-i> just realli like him i don't <laugh-know_if_i'll_feel_that_wai_in> <vocnois> in ten year from now but it certainli <vocnois> there's a lot of thing <he-that> that our famili ar veri similar i mean we have a lot of the same type of opinion about <vocnois> <sil> about differ thing <ext-and> <he-and> we commun veri well and i think those ar a lot of thing you have to look at <vocnois> from the begin i know that i wa in a relationship for about five year befor i met him <vocnois> <sil> and um <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> hi name wa jason too but <cutoff-h=he> <vocnois> <he-he> <vocnois> he drank a lot <sil> <iver>
great gui <vocnois> but he sure like to get drunk <sil> yknow <vocnois> and the problem wa he would turn into such a jerk <iver>
yknow and i just <cutoff-though-thought> <he-it?> <vocnois> <sil> i just don't <sil> i just don't like thi is not so is thi someth <he-that> <vocnois> <sil> when i look long term is thi someth that i wanna deal with for the rest of my life and i said no it just isn't <vocnois> yknow and i think that you have to look <cutoff-a=at> <vocnois> <sil> and see if you're compat with somebodi <sil> <he-befor> <vocnois> <sil> yknow peopl get into situat and thei marri peopl that you <he-just> you've <sil> from the outsid you can look and you can think <vocnois> ar you nut <sil> yknow that is never gonna <laugh-work_yknow> so i think that <vocnois> <sil> you just kinda hafta take into consider yknow ar you compat do you realli feel like thi is someth that's gonna <cutoff-be=be?> that's gonna work and be posit <sil> yeah i don't <sil> i don't <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> i'm not old <laugh-enough_to_know_anyth_yet> <vocnois> <iver>
um-hum <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> it's a lot bigger <sil> <iver>
um <sil> <vocnois> <sil> the thing that i notic that ar differ <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> i guess <cutoff-a=and> i mean <he-if> you look like <vocnois> <cutoff-a=as> as far as expans obvious there's a lot of area that that ar develop now that didn't us to be <iver>
<ext-um> <sil> <he-i> <he-i> certainli spent most of my time <he-well> <sil> in the area that i grew up i mean i don't <iver>
<vocnois> i don't realli go over to the east side veri <cutoff-o=often> veri often yknow sometim we'd go over yknow in highschool and drive and see if we could see a prostitut <sil> yknow or someth like that <vocnois> but <sil> um <vocnois> i <he-don't> <sil> i don't know <cutoff-wha=what> <sil> as far as <vocnois> i don't realli keep up with statist as far as the crime rate and those type of thing i mean i don't know <vocnois> if it's the media <laugh=uh_that's> <unknown> yknow <cutoff-kin=kinda> <sil> portrai as there's more than there us to be <vocnois> um <sil> i know that when i wa younger i wa allow to <cutoff-d=do> to do a lot more thing <vocnois> uh by myself like to to go place on the bu <he-and> and those type of thing and <vocnois> than my famili's allow to do now <iver>
so i don't know mayb it is a littl bit more danger <vocnois> um but i think that come with the <cutoff-b=bigger> with a bigger citi when you get more peopl there's obvious gonna be <cutoff-wi=?> some more problem <sil> um <vocnois> and uh i mean that's <he-realli> that's realli all that i know so it's obvious a lot more build up it's gotten a lot more commerci thing like citi center and 
<iver>
and a lot more um <vocnois> differ suburb so mayb it's <vocnois> it's go and <he-and> becom a littl wealthier <iver>
and <iver>
i don't think it's <cutoff-realli=realli> i don't think it's realli affect me <cutoff-tha=that> i mean obvious there's more place to go shop or to <ext-eat> or you there's more traffic <laugh-laugh_i> don't particularli care much for <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> but <he-it> <he-i> don't think it wa ever such a small town where it wa like everybodi knew each other <vocnois> <he-it> <he-and> it felt like a small commun i mean i know in my own neighborhood <vocnois> <ext-it's> it wa where <he-you> you went to school with the peopl onc at least onc i went to highschool i went to public school <iver>
um <sil> and you kinda knew everybodi around the neighborhood but i think that that's still <vocnois> that's still the same for the neighborhood that my famili live in <sil> um <vocnois> so i don't <cutoff-thing=think> <he-i> me person other than <vocnois> other than the fact that mayb there's a coupl more thing to do there's bigger more comfort movi theater and <vocnois> and that kinda stuff <he-it> hasn't realli <iver>
affect me and i can't sai that <vocnois> <iver>
that mayb if <he-it> if it would have stai small <ext-mayb> <vocnois> mayb <he-i> could notic some kind of a differ <laugh-that_wai_but> <vocnois> but <he-i> i never <vocnois> <he-i> i haven't notic anyth <iver>
right <iver>
<vocnois> i can see that i yknow uh like i said for me i kind of <he-a> <vocnois> i kinda stai where i am so it's not that i realli travel <he-out> into some of those other area <sil> more <vocnois> so i mean <cutoff-w=well?> it doesn't realli affect me person <sil> mayb that's <ext-bad> <laugh-i_don't_know_mayb_should_i> <cutoff-j=just> feel guilti <laugh-about_that> but <iver>
but <iver>
um-hum <iver>
right <iver>
right <vocnois> right <vocnois> i think there's uh you thei're so mani small commun like even <he-o> o s u is realli a <vocnois> <sil> obvious it own it own littl commun and then you've got <vocnois> yknow dublin and thei've got their own parad and their own differ thing so i agre i mean i think that <vocnois> that you there realli is a lot of thing to do in our own individu area that <vocnois> i can't see somebodi from dublin go over to <vocnois> the west side <he-to> to do <laugh-anyth> <laugh> <vocnois> yknow what <he-i> i don't <vocnois> and uh mayb also <he-i> i feel safer <vocnois> where i live too and and that's someth that's an issu for me i know when i <vocnois> do travel down cleveland avenu it make me it doe it make me nervou <vocnois> so <vocnois> i just kinda stai awai from that <vocnois> um <iver>
<laugh> <laugh=i_don't_know> <sil> i don't wanna get shot <iver>
um-hum <sil> yeah <iver>
um-hum <iver>
yeah <iver>
<vocnois> well it's <he-kinda> it's kinda hard when you've got <laugh-your> <vocnois> your <cutoff-v=?> limit choic here yknow some of it some of the issu i thought were kind of <vocnois> import but when you're look at the <vocnois> <sil> mayori candid <sil> did you watch that debat <iver>
oh wa <laugh-horribl_it_wa_a_horribl> <vocnois> becaus you watch it and you think <he-uh> oh my god <vocnois> <iver>
i don't want either of these peopl <iver>
i mean <cutoff-dod=dorothi> dorothi peter obvious been around for a realli long time and i uh <vocnois> i would tip i'm <vocnois> my view ar typic a littl bit more democrat but i'm not too sai that i certainli wouldn't vote <vocnois> um <vocnois> for the person that i thought would do the best job <iver>
but when you look at coleman he <sil> <cutoff-thi=think> <sil> think <vocnois> there wa <cutoff-a=a> <sil> point where thei <cutoff-sai=said?> thei ask a ye or no question <iver>
and neither on of these folk <sil> could <he-answer> it ye <sil> or no and thei're go <vocnois> just answer ye or no thei'll tell you <vocnois> well i think i state my point veri clearli when i wa <vocnois> no the answer is ye or is it wa <vocnois> it wa um <vocnois> healthcar <ext-for> <vocnois> live partner <vocnois> um <vocnois> it's a simpl question <vocnois> ye or no how do you stand on thi issu and it just <vocnois> drive me nut that <vocnois> yknow and i know that that from a p r stand point you don't wanna <vocnois> you don't wanna shun ani peopl awai that might vote for you becaus you feel like the <vocnois> damn it <sil> yknow if you're run for offic <sil> you should just <sil> just be up front <iver>
just sai how you feel <iver>
yknow becaus i just think it look so aw when you can't you can't even admit to what <he-you> what you're opinion is <iver>
yknow and <he-and> it's just <vocnois> i think that that happen so often there ar too mani peopl or even that whole thing with bill clinton when you're talk circl around yourself <vocnois> but you never sai anyth <iver>
so that's <sil> that's frustrat for me when you look at both of the candid and you think <sil> i don't want either on of these peopl there should be a none of the abov <vocnois> yknow if there wa <he-uh> that option i'm sure a lot <cutoff-mo=more> <iver>
um-hum <iver>
realli yknow i agre i mean none of the abov you go and i think a lot more peopl would certainli go out <vocnois> thei would vote for none of the abov and thei we can have some more candid <iver>
i think that would be perfect <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
<vocnois> i think it would <iver>
well i think it's true <he-you> <he-you> don't vote becaus you think i don't want either on of these peopl what doe it matter <iver>
<he-he> who care so yknow peopl just think <vocnois> there's no realli no point to even vote <vocnois> <he-sinc> it's too bad <vocnois> realli is <iver>
hum <vocnois> transport issu <vocnois> that wa kind of a <vocnois> i thought that rail system look kinda cool yknow which is <vocnois> which is kinda tough the question is do we wanna spend the monei on it <vocnois> and will peopl actual us it <vocnois> um <vocnois> i think a lot of it goe back down to traffic and you're like yknow peopl drive both wai <vocnois> and i think if peopl ar <cutoff-actu=actual> if thei're gonna make it so peopl ar actual gonna <ext-us> it <sil> i think i probabl a <cutoff-b=pretti> <sil> pretti good thing to have <vocnois> <sil> and <he-i> i vote for <laugh> <laugh=which_i_know_jason_said> <vocnois> i can't believ you're gonna do that <vocnois> <iver>
yeah <vocnois> <he-uh> and i <vocnois> i just i guess i just felt like <sil> i don't know it's it's kinda <he-i> <cutoff-mea=mean> <laugh> <sil> i don't i just think that that's kinda neat and if you're look at traffic and <vocnois> and i could see if i wa go downtown and come back <vocnois> <sil> the amount of monei that you pai to park downtown is <vocnois> <sil> outrag <vocnois> um <vocnois> even <cutoff-ju=just> just have <he-to> take <sil> i know when it's when it wa snow becaus i work on <he-i> work on front street <vocnois> and where i would come <cutoff-fro=from> i live on bethel road which is <vocnois> i'd take bethel to three fifteen <vocnois> down <sil> through downtown and it would take me an hour and forti five minut <sil> in the snow <vocnois> to get down there and if i could <vocnois> if i could jump on thi rail system and it would take me fifteen minut and i wouldn't have to pai fifti dollar a month for park <vocnois> <he-why> why not do that <vocnois> and all there's also the whole pollut thing and <vocnois> and those type of thing so i thought that wa <iver>

it's just the <cutoff-spirit=spiritu> <ext-the> spiritu aspect there is the realm even einstein the most <vocnois> brilliant man supposedli mathemat of our time <sil> <vocnois> <sil> ah even said that there will be peopl or should be peopl come along with better theori than he ha yet but nobodi ha taken the time or made the time <sil> <vocnois> to challeng hi theori <iver>
yknow <sil> <vocnois> <sil> he sai that e equal m c squar i sai it's e equal m c cube becaus <he-the> the world is three dimension <vocnois> it's not two dimension <sil> <vocnois> <sil> uh two dimension limit <sil> everyth but you look at hi theori of rel <sil> <vocnois> all of our mathemat theorem <vocnois> physic theorem on physic and thing of that natur <sil> <vocnois> <sil> have been base off that <sil> <iver>
and thei're not accur <sil> 
becaus i've <ext-seen> <sil> <vocnois> thing that ar not <sil> physic possibl <iver>
thei're suppos to be not physic possibl <sil> <sil> goe against the first law of physic <sil> <vocnois> <sil> but i saw it happen <sil> <iver>
i experienc it <sil> well <sil> ah <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> <vocnois> and some of our ceremoni <ext-yknow> uh <sil> <vocnois> <sil> thi is confidenti right <sil> no on els is gonna see thi <vocnois> becaus i don't wanna <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> i don't wanna have ani of thi print or anyth <vocnois> yknow it uh <vocnois> <iver>
okai <iver>
all right <iver>
well in in the ambigu part of it yknow just sai try to be <sil> protect of <sil> the wai <iver>
of the peopl of thi land that <vocnois> <sil> there's in a <cutoff-c=ceremoni> a ceremoni call an eneepe which is a sweat lodg <sil> and a lot of peopl will talk about sweat lodg um <sil> it involv heat up stone <sil> in a fire <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and <ext-uh> <vocnois> put the stone <ext-in> <ext-the> <sil> lodg <sil> and pour water over them and close the door and sing song <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it's not a sauna <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it's <sil> not a uh steam room <iver>
uh <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it's a veri spiritu <sil> experi <sil> ye it get hot in there <sil> <vocnois> how hot <sil> who know <sil> but <vocnois> it's been such a strengthen <sil> spiritu strengthen <sil> thing <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it also <sil> physic purifi you by so much sweat that pour out of your bodi becaus of that heat <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> it get all the crap out of you <iver>
yknow <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it clear you purifi you that's what it wa for <sil> that's what the peopl us it for purif <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and even <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it's made up of four round usual sometim three <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <ext-uh> and the last round is usual call the purif round <sil> where whoever's pour the sweat the spiritu leader that's pour the sweat <sil> <vocnois> <sil> he'll make it tough on you <iver>
<vocnois> he'll pour all the water that's left in that bucket <sil> and he'll do it in a wai <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it just bring that heat out that steam that breath that sacr breath is what we call it <iver>
god <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> and breath that <sil> it's like when we were in the womb of her mother <sil> we were breath water <sil> we were breath <sil> fluid <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> oxygen is in that fluid too <sil> it's in that mist that goe over the <sil> <vocnois> <sil> the field <iver>
god's in that <sil> yknow <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> <vocnois> even when a cow take a crap in the middl of the field and that steam come off it in the winter time <sil> <vocnois> god's in that steam <sil> <vocnois> <sil> a lot of peopl can't understand that <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <ext-but> um <sil> <vocnois> <sil> so <cutoff-the> the the law of thermodynam sai that it's imposs for rock to retain heat that wai and that thei can't be heat to an adequ point of <sil> <vocnois> <sil> of withhold heat <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> or sustain heat <vocnois> <sil> when heat by a fire <iver>
<vocnois> that <sil> you would need <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <ext-um> <sil> like in the old dai yknow to melt metal <sil> <vocnois> <sil> thei us uh air <sil> pump it through <iver>
<ext-coal> <sil> <vocnois> <sil> like the blacksmith or whatev yknow <sil> <vocnois> <iver>
<ext-to> melt and <sil> soften the metal so thei could work with it <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <ext-um> <sil> ye the air would help increas the temperatur <sil> <vocnois> <sil> but <sil> a fire kept for a long period of time <sil> will be hotter than ani kind of fire you've ever touch <sil> or been around <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and that fire is sacr it's a sacr fire <vocnois> uh <sil> <vocnois> <sil> so that's why it's possibl <sil> but <sil> if it <sil> if i went down there with the law of physic <vocnois> told me that those rock <sil> couldn't sustain heat <sil> <vocnois> <sil> yet i see when the fire keeper break them out of the <sil> <vocnois> <sil> out of the fire pit and bring them into the sweat lodg that thei're red orang glow <sil> you gonna tell me thei're not hot <sil> so that's that's on exampl <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <iver>
<sil> ye <iver>
i've done it <sil> for the last uh <sil> bout five year <iver>
uh <sil> how mani i don't know it doesn't matter <vocnois> um <vocnois> <sil> been in <ext-in> <vocnois> mani on that were <sil> too hard for me <sil> <iver>
<sil> and i had to get out <sil> uh <sil> and other on <cutoff-i=it> it's a it's a struggl <sil> with that thing and understand it <sil> take time to understand it <sil> <vocnois> <sil> lot of peopl lot of good peopl ar help me <sil> to try and understand it <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> i wa try to let the fear of that <sil> um <sil> <vocnois> though i'm not afraid to die <sil> <vocnois> <sil> i'm afraid sometim that i'll die befor i get a chanc to do <sil> what i feel i wa sent here to do <sil> which is just the basic thing <sil> <vocnois> <sil> fall in love with somebodi have children rais them <iver>

<vocnois> <sil> <he-yeah> <sil> and and the problem is uh the problem is see thing in other peopl <sil> i mean actual see <sil> spirit <sil> in other peopl in term of <sil> <vocnois> <sil> someon said the ey ar the mirror to the soul <sil> that's veri true <sil> yknow <sil> <vocnois> <sil> i could see <sil> in certain peopl's <ext-ey> when i wa in the hospit <sil> the confus <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <ext-the> <sil> unsur <sil> feel <sil> yknow the <sil> <vocnois> <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> <sil> i don't know <sil> i didn't there's someth that i could see there that i can't explain and i still can't explain it <sil> <vocnois> <sil> i just <ext-know> what i <ext-see> <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and then i go and try and tell the psychologist psychiatrist well thei want to put me on some kind of <sil> <vocnois> <sil> anti hallucinogen <sil> medic and i said well listen man <sil> yknow <sil> <vocnois> i'm not hallucin <iver>
<sil> <vocnois> <sil> and these peopl that hear voic <vocnois> thei're not hallucin <sil> thei're hear voic of spirit <sil> and in mani cultur thei'll tell you most the indigen cultur <vocnois> throughout the world will tell you <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and the histori will show <vocnois> that those peopl were rever as gift <sil> <iver>
<sil> thi is the onli societi <sil> <vocnois> <sil> that <sil> label them <sil> mental ill <sil> <iver>
<vocnois> and <ext-becaus> larg becaus of the fear of not know <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and not know how to deal with the unseen <iver>
<sil> <iver>
so <iver>
<vocnois> yeah he did <iver>
<sil> there's no doubt in my mind that he <sil> <vocnois> <sil> heard those voic now whether thei were actual <sil> <vocnois> <sil> audibl voic <sil> or <sil> whether thei were voic from the insid <iver>
in hi own mind <sil> <vocnois> <sil> regardless it's part of that bad spirit that peopl have creat <sil> not the devil <sil> not satan <sil> to the nativ peopl he doesn't <ext-exist> <sil> and to me he doesn't exist <sil> <vocnois> <sil> he's a piec of shit <sil> <vocnois> <sil> but he's real <sil> <iver>
<sil> <vocnois> and he's real becaus peopl give him that <iver>
<sil> thei believ in him <sil> thei empow that <sil> that <ext-fear> of him <sil> <vocnois> <sil> empow it <sil> hi exist <sil> <vocnois> <sil> when you got like mind peopl around yknow <sil> <sil> <sil> you can creat a spirit <sil> <iver>
<sil> a bad on <sil> or a good on <sil> <iver>
<sil> <vocnois> <sil> so <sil> thi boi <sil> <vocnois> whatev he did <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> yeah there's no doubt in my mind that he either heard <sil> <vocnois> <sil> intern voic or <sil> ah actual audibl voic of spirit that were <sil> <vocnois> <sil> ah <sil> misguid spirit <iver>
while thei were here <sil> there ar mani peopl that were bad egg man <sil> 
<vocnois> <sil> and then thei physic di <sil> befor thei got a chanc to live <sil> <vocnois> and when their spirit wake up <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and find out that thei're physic dead and thei can't do anyth in a physic world anymor <vocnois> thei want to <sil> draw themselv to especi if thei were a bad person <sil> <vocnois-word_word> <sil> thei want to draw them to <sil> <vocnois> the brightest thing <iver>
<sil> which ar <sil> children of light <iver>
and as the wai i put it it's kind of new agei and i don't like new agei stuff but <vocnois> <sil> yknow it's <ext-the> best exampl is moth <sil> from the dark when you flip on a light <sil> the moth will go right to it <sil> <vocnois> a child like that <sil> <vocnois> a young man like that is veri impression veri young still <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and uh these bad spirit will be <sil> flock right to him <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> um <sil> so when he did that though i mean <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> there's medic out there that can help peopl like i said i don't wanna see peopl with brain injuri <sil> <vocnois> with mental ill <vocnois> <sil> or with ani kind of disabl <sil> <vocnois> <sil> us that <sil> as an excus <sil> <iver>

when i did school levi campaign <sil> uh and a coupl of other campaign to me the biggest thing is is <sil> what the <cutoff-c=campaign> the <vocnois> campaign doe on elect dai call get out the vote <vocnois> that's the most import thing that can be done <sil> um <sil> i us to <sil> alwai at the begin of a a campaign for a school levi <vocnois> get a list of all the regist voter and of cours i had a veri limit popul in a school district <sil> and i would have the school district compar it to <sil> parent and the first thing i'd do is regist parent <sil> becaus mani of them <vocnois> don't vote <sil> uh and i read a studi somewher that the averag person in thi countri doesn't even begin to vote until thei're forti <sil> if i had known that when i wa in colleg <sil> and work so hard to get the vote chang to eighteen becaus i couldn't vote till i wa twenti on <sil> and i wa upset <sil> yknow becaus i want to vote for certain candid becaus of the vietnam war <sil> that wa a big issu and i couldn't <sil> uh i had to wait till i wa twenti on so there were a bunch of us at colleg that <sil> yknow work and did some volunt work to get that whole thing chang <sil> if i'd known that thei weren't gonna vote at eighteen <sil> and thei were gonna wait until thei were almost forti <sil> i wouldn't of i wouldn't of wast my time <sil> um but anywai um <sil> <cutoff-y=you> <sil> you get parent who ar usual younger especi of the the first second third grade ag <vocnois> 
<vocnois> and you regist them <sil> and then you just keep after them you keep give them inform and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign <sil> uh in ohio i think it's easier to do that becaus there is a law that <sil> <vocnois> i don't think it's in primari <vocnois> but in gener elect at eleven o'clock in the morn and four o'clock in the afternoon <vocnois> thei hafta list those who have vote thei hafta put up a list of uh <sil> regist voter and cross out those who have vote <sil> so what i useta do is i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elect earlier and compar it with my list of who had shown support <sil> or <cutoff-wer=were> wa undecid on the elect <sil> and i would cross off those that had vote <sil> and then i had a list of those that hadn't <sil> and i had peopl wait at a phone bank <sil> and i'd call them at work or at home and and i'd offer to take them to the poll <sil> if you don't have a ride <sil> uh we will take you to the poll <sil> if you're worri about yknow someon watch your kid we have certifi teacher who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babysit for you while you go to vote <vocnois> becaus i've also read studi that sai peopl who ar rout from their home or their offic <sil> yknow and ar remind to go vote <sil> will also vote for whatev issu or candid ha remind them to do that <vocnois> becaus what i did wa is a veri low kei thing i would call peopl on elect dai and sai <sil> hi thi is roberta i'm call to remind you that todai is elect dai and we hope that you will rememb to exercis your most import freedom which is to go vote <sil> and oh by the wai <sil> oh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levi and <sil> and if you need a ride let me know we've got them set up for you <sil> and <vocnois> but yknow that's veri <sil> i mean <cutoff-eh=and> and and that's not get peopl to vote <sil> and encourag them to vote becaus thei should that's a a special campaign for a particular issu or a candid <sil> i don't know how you get peopl to vote <sil> i don't know why thei don't think it's import mayb becaus <sil> we've had it too easi my <error-go=godfath?> <sil> my grandfath didn't <sil> my grandfath didn't i mean there wa a king and queen and yknow he had no right to vote <sil> so that when he came here and he could <sil> that wa the most import thing in the world to him <sil> yknow and that that he just pass it on to <sil> yknow hi daughter my mother <sil> my father i don't know how he <sil> it wa import to him but it wa alwai import to him and we talk about polit at the dinner tabl sometim <sil> we talk about <sil> issu and he said yknow it wa import to to be heard <sil> so i don't know if it wa that <sil> it got pass on parent wise or what it wa <sil> <iver>

middl <iver>
<iver>
<iver>
oh yeah thei were more settl <iver>

thei think everyth thei sai is hilari oh it's just middl school i think it's <vocnois> transit from childhood <vocnois> to adulthood is a tough time <vocnois> <sil> and um <sil> when you have all the other <sil> thing go on like you can't read and you can't write and you can't spell <vocnois> then it's just even wors <error-ik's=it's> <cutoff-ek=exacerb> it's exacerb even more <sil> <vocnois> <sil> so <sil> i get the on that everybodi els throw out of their class <vocnois> <iver>
and thei <cutoff-g=go> <iver>

<vocnois> oh there alwai ha been <vocnois> there alwai ha been i think a lot of peopl feel that kid <vocnois> <sil> a lot of kid ar on medic todai that shouldn't be <sil> but um <sil> i think that's the fault of the school or the parent <vocnois> or some doctor that like for exampl when we <error-frefer=refer> kid in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctor that we work with <vocnois> and we know that thei won't just give thi kid a pill if he doesn't have <vocnois> <sil> eight out of the twelv symptom or whatev <sil> so we refer them to those doctor and then <sil> <vocnois> <sil> if <sil> thi <cutoff-do=doctor> <vocnois> those doctor ar pretti conserv too and if thei put them on med it's usual just for the school dai <sil> <vocnois> <sil> not dure the summer not over vacat not after five o'clock <sil> <vocnois> <sil> not on the weekend <vocnois> and it's just to help them focu <sil> and then <sil> these doctor also ask for <vocnois> report back from the teacher and if you don't see ani appreci differ <vocnois> in two or three week then you take the kid off and you try someth els <vocnois> and some kid medic is like the differ between night and dai you go back in observ the kid you can't believ it's the same kid <vocnois> other kid <sil> doesn't phase them thei might as well be drink a glass of water <vocnois> <sil> well <sil> sinc thei have side effect like thei stunt your growth and thei <vocnois> subdu your appetit and some of the other <sil> yknow some kid get headach from dexadrin and ader <vocnois> <sil> so i sai yknow if it work us it if it <sil> if it doesn't work just forget it <vocnois> but <sil> yknow a lot of <sil> peopl feel that too mani kid ar on thi stuff becaus <vocnois> <sil> there mai be just <sil> not abl to pai attent a littl bit but thei're not realli a d d <vocnois> <sil> and the parent ar take them in and go <vocnois> johnni's not get straight a's put him on someth <laugh> <laugh> so <sil> i guess <iver>

<iver>
<iver>
oh i think <sil> i think that the societi <sil> in uh gener is declin in a <laugh-lot_of> wai <sil> <vocnois> <sil> our moral ar <error-degclin=degrad+declin?> and our <vocnois> <sil> uh <sil> intellig level <sil> mayb not level i mean i q's ar still high but peopl ar <vocnois> settl for less <sil> i have a big sign in my room that sai never settl <sil> <vocnois> <sil> for less than your veri best <vocnois> becaus i realli think peopl <vocnois> ar get lazi <sil> even adult <cutoff-we=we> yknow we don't even want to wait twenti five second for microwav popcorn <vocnois> we don't yknow we're get impati <iver>
yeah we're get impati and we're get <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> it's it's sort of like yknow the pendulum will swing back the other wai eventu mayb thirti year from now there'll be <vocnois> kid'll be yknow in thi countri will be learn more than thei ever have <vocnois> but right now i think we're <sil> <vocnois> <sil> we're realli not <sil> do justic <sil> to <sil> the curriculum <sil> and i sai to <cutoff-m=my> my friend i sai <vocnois> teach these kid well becaus thei're gonna be run the countri in our old ag <vocnois> we'll be sit in a rock chair and thei'll be run the countri so you better teach them well <sil> when you look at it like that <iver>
you it's quit an invest <iver>
<iver>
when you think that <sil> our major resourc <sil> is <cutoff-ch=children> <sil> is our children and our offspr <vocnois> <sil> then we'd better not <sil> yknow <iver>
well i think <iver>
well i think in gener like <sil> let's sai if you took <sil> a <sil> hand of execut from borden or <vocnois> a t and t or <vocnois> someplac like that <vocnois> you would probabl find that <sil> in gener thei're veri concern <iver>
if thei're especi if thei're over forti <vocnois> becaus their compani's give monei back to the commun for thi and that <sil> and <vocnois> yknow that's how thei're try to show that thei care about thi thei're try to <vocnois> mentor some school or some group of kid or give monei for the <vocnois> downtrodden or <sil> yknow <sil> but <sil> you're right i think it's terribl that <sil> everi other countri in the world <sil> <vocnois> <sil> ha higher math skill than we do <sil> <vocnois> <sil> better scienc skill than we do <sil> <vocnois> <sil> better languag <error-shkill=skill> than we do <sil> <vocnois> <sil> why canadian even go to school for thirteen year not twelv <vocnois> yknow <sil> and <vocnois> i just think that <sil> thi profici thing is final go to <vocnois> make peopl account <sil> <iver>
the profici test that thei're now requir <vocnois> you can't graduat from an ohio high school <sil> <vocnois> <sil> with a <cutoff-gra=graduat> uh with a diploma <sil> unless you pass <sil> all the profici test <vocnois> and that mean you have to take <vocnois> on in citizenship <sil> which is like govern and histori <vocnois> on in math <vocnois> on in scienc <sil> <vocnois> <sil> on in write <sil> and on in read <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and you have <sil> you can try to <sil> pass <vocnois> the first time in the <cutoff-e=eighth> at the end of the eighth grade <vocnois> and you get two tri in the ninth grade <sil> two tri in the tenth <sil> two in the eleventh two in the twelfth <vocnois> you can take them as mani time as you need to take them <vocnois> but if you don't pass them all by the time you graduat <vocnois> you get thi nifti littl thing call an attend certif <sil> it's not a real diploma it's like okai i attend <sil> i didn't learn anyth <vocnois> but i wa there <iver>
how mani peopl want that <iver>
<iver>
<sil> <iver>
and the question aren't easi <sil> <sil> i mean <sil> i mean the <sil> i doubt if i could pass some of them <sil> i mean <vocnois> <sil> i probabl could pass the citizenship and the <vocnois> <sil> and the english <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and mayb the scienc becaus i like scienc and i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass the math <sil> becaus i don't teach math and i don't us math that much <vocnois> other than just normal <sil> yknow add subtract multipli <iver>
yeah and geometri and and trig and calculu and physic and <sil> <vocnois> <sil> a littl smatter of everyth <sil> and uh <sil> i bet i couldn't pass the <vocnois> i bet i couldn't pass the math without some <vocnois> instruct <sil> but <sil> my son didn't pass the write part he pass everyth but the write part <vocnois> and the write part <sil> thei ask you to write <sil> two <sil> five paragraph essai and thei give you these topic and you can pick from them <vocnois> and you have to do it right there <sil> in like a three hour block of time <iver>
no <sil> the prompt ar onli given out that dai <vocnois> even the teacher don't know what thei're gonna be <vocnois> and it might be someth as gener as tell about your neighborhood <vocnois> or it might be someth as specif as <vocnois> <sil> when you were littl what <sil> toi wa your most favorit <sil> and you have to write five paragraph on it <sil> so <laugh> <sil> <laugh> <iver>
no more than five becaus there's a specif <sil> <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> it's call the five paragraph essai <sil> the first paragraph is your introduct and the final on is your conclus and the three in the middl is the bodi that develop your idea <vocnois> <sil> so <vocnois> i'm teach all my kid right <iver>
on of those <vocnois> <iver>
on differ topic <iver>
oh it's some committe <sil> i mean you have to send them in to <vocnois> some place at the state of ohio <iver>
no <iver>
we send them in <sil> and then <sil> <vocnois> <sil> the kid <sil> let see the eighth grader take them in march and then we get the <cutoff-pa=paper> <vocnois> the score back in mai <sil> sometim <vocnois> and um <sil> some of my kid <vocnois> <sil> well i have a group of kid that i had them when thei were sixth grader and thei just now graduat <sil> 
from high school and <cutoff-i=i> <sil> on in that origin group of kid that i had <vocnois> never did pass them all <sil> but <vocnois> i guess <sil> <vocnois> he's not worri becaus he's gonna work with hi dad in hi dad's busi <sil> so he's gonna be okai but <vocnois> he never did pass the read and the write he pass everyth els but <vocnois> and the question aren't the same <sil> <cutoff-the=there's> i mean there's sever differ form everi time thei send out <sil> the test it's seal in a box and <sil> nobodi is allow to open it but the princip <sil> and <sil> then he ha to distribut it to the teacher and <vocnois> <cutoff-a=and> so the question could chang <iver>
and thei might be someth as easi as what ar the three color in our flag <vocnois> or uh how much of a <sil> uh <sil> how much do you have to have of the senat <vocnois> to pass a law <sil> yknow it could be someth real real <sil> technic or someth <vocnois> that <sil> a three year old could answer <sil> becaus it's try to hit <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> all the area that you've learn <iver>
i think thei're retir teacher or <vocnois> peopl on mayb the board at differ school district or <sil> i don't know <vocnois> well <iver>
cours the multipl choic there's a right or wrong answer and <iver>
<vocnois> but <sil> the write <vocnois> thei give you on point for each <sil> paragraph so you hafta get <sil> five point to pass <sil> <sil> now you might get four out of five and almost pass <sil> and then you hafta retak that on part <iver>
<sil> well yeah that's kind of subject although <vocnois> <sil> there is a paper that <sil> we hand out to our kid that's tell exactli what's suppos to be in everi part of thi essai <vocnois> like the first the introductori paragraph's suppos to consist of <vocnois> a wai to captur the reader's attent <sil> it's suppos to suppli background inform <vocnois> it's suppos to state your thesi statement which tell mainli what the <cutoff-pa=paper's> paper's gonna be about <vocnois> and then you're suppos to end the introductori paragraph by list three idea <sil> about your thesi <vocnois> that you're go to develop in paragraph two three and four <vocnois> so i mean it's <iver>
<iver>
<iver>
well most kid what thei do is <sil> thei tell someth in the bodi that should be in the bodi wai up here in the <cutoff-intr=introduct> <vocnois> most peopl get ahead of themselv <iver>
yknow befor thei <vocnois> tell you <sil> thi wa last summer and it wa on a vacat to myrtl beach <vocnois> thei're tell you about the surfboard that thei got <sil> and how <sil> great thei surf <vocnois> when that realli should come down in the bodi of the paper <vocnois> yknow most peopl just <sil> thei assum the reader know <sil> i alwai sai to my kid <vocnois> pretend like you're write for an alien <iver>
<iver>
noth about thi planet <iver>
like i had my kid last week i had them all write <vocnois> how to make a peanut butter and jelli sandwich <vocnois> and then <vocnois> i had them on by on come up to the tabl in the front thei didn't know i wa gonna do thi <vocnois> so after thei get <cutoff-e=everyth?> all done i go out and i get my littl bag of stuff and i bring in my bread and my peanut butter and my jelli <vocnois> and i sit them down besid me <vocnois> and i go okai now no ad lib <sil> no ad no take awai read exactli what you wrote <iver>
and i do exactli what thei said <vocnois> if thei sai cover the entir piec of bread with peanut butter <vocnois> i cover both side <iver>
crust <vocnois> uh the entir piec of bread <vocnois> if thei sai reach in the <vocnois> bag and grab two piec of bread i reach in the bag and grab them and by the time i get them out thei've got hole in them <vocnois> becaus to me that's what grab mean <iver>
wherea <sil> yknow <iver>
if you just said take <sil> or get <sil> i just <sil> i sai well <sil> i'm just gonna <vocnois> <sil> becaus when you get <unknown-in_that_in_the?> work <sil> out in the work world <sil> there's gonna be two thing thei care about about your write <sil> is it useabl <sil> and is it persuas <sil> becaus usual when you're write someth in the workplac <vocnois> it's either to explain someth <sil> or it's to persuad somebodi to do someth <sil> so if it's not those two thing <sil> it's not <sil> it's not write <sil> that's gonna make it in the world <sil> it's i mean <iver>
oh i have a few kid from time to time that said thei want to be writer <vocnois> which yknow thei have great idea but usual <vocnois> thei can't <sil> thei can tell you them but when thei write it <sil> my kid <vocnois> usual <vocnois> thei leav out word or thei <vocnois> leav off a suffix at the end or and the sentenc make no sens <sil> yknow <sil> i have to call them up and go <sil> what doe thi sai <iver>
or doe thi sai thi <vocnois> yknow <sil> thi is what i thought thi said doe that what that realli sai <vocnois> well here's a perfect exampl the other dai <vocnois> my kid <sil> my sixth grader turn in paper on if i could be an anim here's the anim i would be and here's why <vocnois> and thei had to research the anim thei had like a month to do it <vocnois> and thei had to pick ani anim and tell about their feed habit and their <vocnois> whether thei travel in group or alon and <vocnois> of what part of the world thei mostli habitat <vocnois> what thei eat all that <vocnois> okai perfect exampl <sil> on of my student want to sai <vocnois> my anim <sil> that i pick live mostli on veget <vocnois> and he couldn't figur out how to spell it <vocnois> so he went into the comput and he <sil> ask it <vocnois> and it gave him the word vestibul <iver>
<iver>
<iver>
said to me that can't be wrong becaus the comput said <sil> that wa a word <vocnois> i said that is a word <vocnois> come with me i'll show you what a vestibul is <iver>
so we walk across the street to the church <iver>
<iver>
i said there's a big <iver>
that's a vestibul <sil> doe your anim eat those <sil> my anim eat mostli vestibul <iver>
i <laugh-see> <laugh-i> mean you see <vocnois> the comput <sil> can't be wrong he said <iver>
i said well he <cutoff-di=didn't> it didn't spell vestibul wrong <vocnois> but i doubt if your anim eat <sil> part of build <vocnois> <laugh> <iver>
perfect yknow or your comput can't tell you that you <vocnois> spell o n e <sil> when you meant to spell <sil> w o n <iver>
we won we were victori <vocnois> we didn't on <sil> <laugh> <laugh_yknow> <vocnois> <iver>
oh yeah <sil> uh <iver>
uh <sil> well a lot of my kid do much better <vocnois> with write on the comput <vocnois> becaus thei know that <vocnois> thei can go back and chang it or fix it or thei can get spell help or thei can even get grammar help <vocnois> or thei can mayb even get <vocnois> syntax help <cutoff-i=if> <sil> if it sai thi is awkward or someth turn the sentenc around <vocnois> so my student do a lot better with write if thei do it on the comput <vocnois> than if thei ar ask to do it <sil> pencil and paper <sil> so that's what i make them do their web <sil> you know what a web is don't you <sil> <vocnois> where you <cutoff-p=put?> <sil> web out an idea you <iver>
and it look like a spider web <iver>
i make them do their web <sil> and get their rough draft start <sil> and then thei can go to the comput <sil> becaus thei i find thei um thei ar a littl more creativ when thei get to <sil> <vocnois> think about ad pictur and <vocnois> we call it publish it <sil> when you get to the publish stage <iver>
you should have all your error correct <vocnois> even if you <vocnois> have to rewrit it six time i mean <cutoff-tha=that> it just blow their mind when i sai to them <vocnois> well the other dai i wrote a letter to a senat <sil> and i had to write it six time <sil> i wrote the letter <sil> and rewrot it <vocnois> until it wa perfect <vocnois> and everi time i rewrot it it got better <sil> and i wrote it six time <sil> and i'm an english teacher <iver>
and i tell them write is not an event <sil> it's a process <sil> it's like get your brace put on <sil> you go in on time <sil> and thei might pull a coupl teeth <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and you go in the next time thei might put that littl wire on <vocnois> <sil> then you go in the next time thei might put the lower on on or part of them <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and the next time <sil> then thei put on more <vocnois> and then on time <sil> thei'll tighten them a littl <vocnois> but it's a process that happen over a period of three year <sil> <vocnois> it's not an event <vocnois> thei think thei can sit down and write <sil> okai i'm done <sil> i'm like <laugh> <sil> i don't think so <sil> <laugh-yeah> <vocnois> write is a <iver>
<iver>
yeah <iver>
well and <iver>
don't you think <iver>
yeah <iver>
well i often have to write on paper <vocnois> i believ you turn in the wrong paper <vocnois> i believ i got the rough draft instead of the final copi <vocnois> do you have the final copi somewher at home <iver>
or on your hard drive <sil> um <vocnois> becaus thi realli for all the world look to me just like a rough draft <sil> or i'll sai to my student have your mom look it over have your sister look it over <vocnois> have somebodi els proofread it <vocnois> becaus you're not gonna see the mistak becaus <vocnois> you're too busi think about the content <sil> of what you want to sai <vocnois> and you're not gonna notic them spell t h i m <vocnois> or thei t h a y <vocnois> yeah <sil> or a sentenc that's too long <sil> or a sentenc that's a fragment and it isn't a complet thought <sil> you're not gonna notic that <vocnois> becaus you know what it wa suppos sai <vocnois> so give it to a p friend or somebodi and let them <vocnois> just on your rough copi just let them circl anyth thei don't understand <sil> and that will realli help you <sil> oh <vocnois> well i had a <iver>
<sil> i had a student bring me a paper todai <vocnois> he said thi is for histori <vocnois> i have to write an essai on anthoni wayn 
and the battl at fallen timber <vocnois> here's my i rough draft <vocnois> would you fix it for me befor i make my final copi so i'll get a good grade <vocnois> see <cutoff-i=i> i tell them i said <nois-that's> what i'm here for <vocnois> yknow <sil> i'm here to help you <sil> us me <vocnois> to help you get better grade <vocnois> us me to run interfer <vocnois> if you think you know the scienc <vocnois> but you're get mark down becaus you can't spell the word <vocnois> let me know i'll go talk to your scienc teacher <vocnois> tell her not to count your spell <sil> or not <sil> yknow not to make you take the test without the littl spell checker thing that's in your book bag <vocnois> to let you us that i mean <vocnois> <sil> i do a lot of um <vocnois> what i call advoc for my kid with the regular ed teacher that don't understand <sil> i go in and i sai well <vocnois> yknow thi is kind of a long test <vocnois> could he mayb take half todai and half tomorrow <vocnois> or <sil> would you mind if he came out to my room <sil> ninth period dure studi hall <vocnois> becaus i have a free <nois-period> and i could <sil> like kind of monitor it and <vocnois> and read the word he doesn't know so that he's actual answer what the question realli sai <vocnois> instead of what he think it sai <vocnois> so that you won't be test hi read abil but you'll realli be test whether he know about magnet <iver>
oh <iver>
<iver>
oh ye thei're get better though thei realli ar <vocnois> thei're much better now than thei were twenti year ago <vocnois> becaus <nois-the> trend is <sil> <nois-to> <nois-keep> these student in the mainstream as much as possibl <vocnois> so teacher ar have to learn <vocnois> to <vocnois> for exampl <iver>
yeah how to modifi <vocnois> like <sil> i give <sil> in servic all the time at my school for the regular ed teacher and i show them <vocnois> thei go well that's gonna make more work for me and i sai how is tell the student to do everi other problem <vocnois> instead of all forti of them gonna make <iver>
<iver>
<iver>
<iver>
<iver>
i'm <iver>
<iver>
<iver>
<iver>
<iver>
<iver>
<iver>
<laugh-yeah> <laugh> so <sil> or <sil> how hard can it be to sai to a student if you have a student with an eighti i q for exampl <vocnois> and you know he's not gonna get all the detail and the battl and the year and the <vocnois> captain's name but <sil> you just want him to get the overal gist of the french and american war wa about thi time uh <cutoff-p=period?> <vocnois> in histori and thi wa the result and thi is how long it last <vocnois> just the main concept <vocnois> well there's the kid that you sai <sil> todd <sil> you studi for the test and when you come in i'll let you answer anyth on the test you know <sil> and anyth you don't know you leav blank <sil> and i'll just grade what you put down <iver>
now that doesn't make ani extra work for the teacher <sil> but <sil> it give him a shot <sil> he usual will answer <sil> the concept he'll usual answer the main stuff that he know <vocnois> and if you onli grade him on that <vocnois> <sil> he might have a shot at a c or a b <sil> i mean there's <sil> all kind of wai to modifi <vocnois> <sil> uh <cutoff-r=reduc?> <sil> give a reduc work amount <vocnois> <sil> uh give a kid a copi of anoth student note if hi ar crummi and he <cutoff-k=can't?> can't studi from them <sil> <vocnois> <sil> we even have a thing at our school <sil> that <sil> it's <sil> it look just like notebook paper <vocnois> and it's got the three hole and the line and everi teacher ha a stack of it on their desk <vocnois> but it's <sil> n c r <sil> yknow the <sil> two copi <sil> <iver>
you write on the top <iver>
n c r paper <vocnois> so when you write on the white copi it come through onto the yellow copi <vocnois> and at the end of the period <vocnois> the student just rip off the back copi and hand it to hi friend <sil> so he didn't have to write <sil> yknow if he wasn't get the note <iver>
<sil> and he didn't spell them and he couldn't read them later <vocnois> nobodi ha to know that <sil> so and so went down the hall and made a copi of so and so's note on the xerox machin for the dumb kid <sil> yknow <sil> you just <sil> yknow you just <sil> sai to on <sil> student that sit in the front that's usual a girl <vocnois> who usual yknow write realli neat and get it all <iver>
<vocnois> just go suzi would you <vocnois> us thi paper todai <vocnois> becaus we're gonna review for the test <sil> and then at the end of the period <vocnois> <sil> when the kid ar leav <sil> and give johnni a copi of it <sil> the back copi would you do that for me <sil> well the girl usual write neater <sil> and thei usual get <sil> a girl that doesn't have a learn disabl thei usual get everyth down off the board <vocnois> wherea the boi <nois-will> get a littl distract <vocnois> or thei'll <sil> yknow mayb not <cutoff-si=sit> <sil> thei don't tend to sit up front <sil> thei'll sit in the back so thei can <sil> yknow <sil> jab their friend with a pencil and <vocnois> throw the <cutoff-f=?> <sil> paper wad and stuff <sil> <iver>
so <iver>
oh yeah <sil> almost alwai <vocnois> doesn't matter what <sil> um the disabl is <sil> <laugh-and> <laugh-i> don't know why thi is <vocnois> but thei us to sai eight to on <vocnois> now thei're sai more like five to on <vocnois> doesn't matter if it's a speech impedi <sil> blind retard <vocnois> cerebr palsi deaf <vocnois> learn <cutoff-disa=disabl> you name it <sil> there's <cutoff-a=alwai?> <sil> five to on more boi than there ar girl <sil> and we don't <sil> know why <iver>
<iver>
<iver>
well deaf for exampl uh and blind ar not alwai genet <vocnois> thei don't know why <sil> thei just know that <error-thit=that_it> <sil> show up more in boi than girl <sil> thi year i don't have <vocnois> on i have sixteen student <sil> and i don't have on girl <sil> fact i haven't had ani girl for a coupl of year <sil> i usual have on or two girl and all the rest boi <sil> but <iver>
oh <iver>
thei're not as mani of them or <sil> you mean becaus <iver>
well um <sil> in the lower grade i believ that thei ar becaus <sil> i think thei should have some male <sil> role model <iver>
the lower grade <sil> we have a few <sil> male teacher at first grade and fourth grade but not mani <vocnois> but i think <sil> that <sil> young men <sil> young boi would do better <sil> in a <sil> set in school if thei had a <sil> a man earlier on <sil> rather than have to wait till <vocnois> thei're in middl school <sil> to relat to a coach <sil> and up until then it's alwai been a woman <iver>
<iver>
<iver>
<iver>
<iver>
don't go into elementari ed that much <iver>
that often <sil> thei do but <vocnois> there's just not near as mani of them <sil> i can count on on hand the number of <vocnois> <cutoff-m=men> um <sil> men teacher i've known over the year in elementari ed <sil> practic <vocnois> yknow five <sil> mayb six <sil> that's that's probabl why the boi don't <sil> yknow <sil> <laugh-yeah> <iver>
realli <sil> and it's a fun job it realli is i <cutoff-n=?> i've onli ever known on male <sil> that taught first grade <sil> and i knew on gui that taught third <sil> most the time if thei go in to elementari ed thei go for the upper grade like four five or six <vocnois> but um <sil> i realli think that <sil> if we let <sil> the boi be more expos to men earlier <sil> then <sil> thei would <sil> be more motiv to learn <vocnois> becaus thei would see that it's not just a girli thing <vocnois> thei would sai oh well mister so and so think it's import that i know thi <sil> and he's a real macho gui so i better learn it <sil> yknow <sil> i do i realli do <sil> nowadai <sil> with the pai <sil> be better <sil> we ar get more men <sil> but <iver>
in most <cutoff-ci=citi> <sil> in most <cutoff-area=area> in most school district it's <vocnois> compar to <sil> ani other job now it us to alwai be low but <vocnois> like a <sil> begin teacher in worthington start at i think twenti six <sil> eight <sil> or someth <sil> cours worthington's <sil> on of the <sil> three highest paid district in ohio <vocnois> um <sil> but <sil> <cutoff-i=it> it us to be that <vocnois> teacher <sil> just got paid <sil> lower than a <cutoff-f=fireman> <sil> start fireman or start policeman and <vocnois> yknow you in a sens you're out there risk your life everydai too <iver>

there's just too much divers <iver>
in the world <iver>
and too much prejudic <sil> there realli is still and it's sad but <sil> it there realli is <iver>

onli the <error-onli-er=owner> can do it i mean <sil> seem like with all the technolog in the world thei should be abl to do someth like that <vocnois> the peopl who have gun and <sil> in their home and not have them <sil> lock up or in a <vocnois> yknow in a <vocnois> <sil> place that no child could find it <sil> thei're to blame <sil> thei ar thei're to blame <sil> um <sil> that whole thing with the um <sil> <vocnois> <vocnois> school out in colorado <sil> um <sil> i forget the name of it but <vocnois> yeah <sil> but when thei said that those boi were make those gun in the garag and the parent didn't <vocnois> were clueless i just find that realli hard to believ <sil> if a child goe in to a garag everi night and you hear clang and <sil> and thei're bui gun metal and <sil> yknow <vocnois> <sil> then thei were total <sil> um <sil> not in tune with what their kid were do <sil> it's on thing them have a site on the internet <iver>

<sil> <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
well <vocnois> <sil> i'll be honest <vocnois> <sil> i have a lot of homosexu friend <vocnois> <sil> and <sil> be in the restaur busi and <vocnois> <sil> grow up in the restaur busi and that's how i <vocnois> <sil> realli kind of <sil> <vocnois> met them <sil> <vocnois> <sil> when i wa go to school i didn't know ani <vocnois> <sil> and i went to o u and honestli down there i didn't know <sil> i didn't know anybodi wa gai <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> i feel <vocnois> <sil> that <sil> a lot of peopl were i'll sai <vocnois> <sil> most of them <sil> or all of them <sil> ar born that wai <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> some of them do make a choic <vocnois> <sil> um <vocnois> <sil> but i <sil> feel that <vocnois> it should be <vocnois> <sil> talk about in school <vocnois> um for so long <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it wa in the closet <laugh> <sil> yknow thei didn't talk about it and these kid yknow <sil> <vocnois> had to hide it and i just think in todai's world and there's so mani peopl that ar openli gai <vocnois> <sil> that <vocnois> <sil> it should be talk about more in school <sil> i do <sil> i think <vocnois> <sil> yknow <sil> especi <vocnois> <sil> i just think some <vocnois> and women <sil> there's <sil> women that <sil> you know i had <sil> my gym teacher brook haven now that i look at it <vocnois> i didn't know then <vocnois> but she wa gai <vocnois> i mean we didn't <sil> i didn't think that then i don't know why but she wa veri manli but she wa veri <vocnois> she wa veri good but she wa <vocnois> you know just <sil> not <sil> feminin at all <iver>
and not that that chang my opinion of her <vocnois> um <vocnois> but <sil> back then and nobodi would talk about it <sil> and <sil> yknow <vocnois> <sil> i just think <sil> in todai's world <sil> we need to bring <vocnois> <sil> subject like that out <vocnois> <sil> no on <sil> <vocnois> becaus there's so mani peopl who ar asham about <sil> thing <vocnois> <sil> and thei shouldn't be asham becaus it's a lifestyl anymor <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> i just <sil> it need to be brought up more <vocnois> <iver>
yeah <iver>
well <iver>
um-hum <iver>
well but see i think if you <sil> realli try to tell <sil> kid and especi women <vocnois> <sil> that <vocnois> yknow you shouldn't <sil> sex is someth that <sil> should be between two peopl that love each other <vocnois> <sil> and unless you realli <sil> <vocnois> <sil> feel love and realli <sil> think <sil> it is love then <sil> yknow <sil> you shouldn't do it <iver>
um i know that's a lot easier said than done <vocnois> becaus <sil> you fall in love everi other week sometim when you're young <vocnois> <sil> um <vocnois> <sil> but i don't think it encourag it <nois> i just think in <sil> you know thei show so much on t v it's all yknow peopl ar <sil> nude on at ten o clock at night on these show <vocnois> <sil> and these girl ar watch it <vocnois> i mean grant most of them ar adult <sil> but on the soap opera and stuff it's a differ stori <vocnois> so thei're see it anywai <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> <nois> <sil> you just i think if you're open enough with your children these parent <vocnois> <sil> and sai you know we <cutoff-w=want> <sil> we want to give you thi option we realli <vocnois> <sil> prefer you don't do thi but if you decid to do it we want you to be protect <iver>
i mean i think that's the best wai to <nois> address it <vocnois> <sil> and as far as the homosexu i think there is kid who <sil> sai well mayb i'm gai i don't know if i'm gai or what <vocnois> well <vocnois> hopefulli <sil> thei'll know <sil> their true ident <sil> eventu <vocnois> <iver>
i mean ye some peopl <sil> 
<vocnois> um <vocnois> you just i think if you're open enough with your children these parent <vocnois> and sai you know we <cutoff-w-want> <sil> we want to give you thi option we realli prefer you don't do thi <vocnois> but if you decid to do it we want you to be protect <iver>
i mean i think that's the best wai to <nois> address it <vocnois> and as far as the homosexu i think there is kid who <sil> sai well mayb i'm gai i don't know if i'm gai or what <sil> well <sil> hopefulli <sil> thei'll know <sil> their true ident <vocnois> eventu <sil> i mean ye some peopl <vocnois> i mean i know men <vocnois> sever men who got marri had children and then thei <nois> decid thei were gai <vocnois> okai were thei gai befor but thei did like women <iver>
yknow and thei did want the children <iver>
and now <sil> thei live <vocnois> in gai relationship <iver>
but thei said all along <sil> thei were gai <sil> thei just fought it <sil> and thei thei didn't want the pressur from their famili <iver>
so <sil> ah <sil> you <nois> know <vocnois> i <vocnois> i just think the more you're open about thing <vocnois> i just think that's the best why it <sil> yknow <vocnois> when you put thing and don't talk about it that's when the problem start <iver>
but i think kid in high school and stuff <sil> some of them <nois> like <sil> my brother in law is gai <vocnois> and <sil> when i met him i knew he wa i <sil> yknow <sil> he wa the type <sil> some of them you can't tell well it doesn't matter what thei look like <vocnois> um <sil> but my husband said all through grow up <sil> he like men <sil> he didn't like girl <vocnois> he look at <laugh-magazin you know all thi stuff <vocnois> and i thought that's so funni becaus grow up i just didn't know <sil> know anybodi that wa <vocnois> <sil> um but <sil> you know he wa openli gai to hi mother right from the begin <vocnois> and <vocnois> she wa from germani which made it a littl tough becaus <sil> yknow thei didn't talk about <sil> <unknown> those thing <sil> over there at all <nois> for a long time <sil> but um <sil> then she becam veri open with him and everi but everybodi knew <nois> <sil> and that wa in the eighti <nois> and <sil> yknow <sil> if some kid know it when thei're young and grow up <sil> yknow i don't know if it's best to not sai it or to <sil> yknow <vocnois> be open but if thei're open to their parent about it <vocnois> then their parent ar go to deal with it a lot better then <sil> than if thei wait <sil> later on in their life <sil> yknow <vocnois> but some of sometim i guess thei chang <sil> yknow <vocnois> most the men i knew <sil> right off the bat <sil> know i mean i mean it wa it <vocnois> and it wa all through their life it wasn't as though thei just said oh <sil> i'm <cutoff-go-go> <sil> i'm go be gai <iver>

<laugh> <iver>
north <iver>
oh project were <vocnois> <sil> right from infanc were <vocnois> i wa design <vocnois> the project <vocnois> first of all we had to find out what we had <vocnois> with the vestur and <vocnois> <sil> uh as everyon should know even as a residenti user you have to know what you have in your hous <sil> the telephon compani doesn't <sil> provid the servic to you anymor <sil> well we had to know what we had through out the state of ohio <sil> and some <sil> eighti eight counti and uh wherev els number of facil we had <sil> and so we went on a scaveng hunt <iver>
basic <sil> becaus the plan which the util had <sil> for our locat thei could not provid to us becaus of the uh <sil> the vestur rule <sil> so we had to go out and um <vocnois> do our own survei <sil> becom self educ through uh cours uh through a t t and through purdu univers it wa i think o u had some cours <vocnois> and um <sil> ultim the univers here now ha i think a major in telecommun group <vocnois> but uh <vocnois> the project basic we were go from a um <vocnois> put togeth a network itself <sil> and uh we had a <sil> you think of a parti line system what thei us call daisi chain <sil> in the industri <sil> uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get on to <sil> a data network <sil> and <vocnois> we got down to point where <sil> we went to a <vocnois> spoke network where everyon had dedic pipe <iver>
to the hub <vocnois> um which cours elimin down time <sil> but with um <vocnois> that we were <sil> not in a posit to monitor traffic <iver>
and telecommun is veri much like a highwai <sil> you need to know what your load's go to be befor you construct it or vice yknow <vocnois> otherwis your plan's wai off <vocnois> well <vocnois> nowadai we're in a posit where we're do <vocnois> more advanc than anyth our agenc is the onli on in the state of ohio <sil> and the privat network <vocnois> uh as a privat sector is still look as <cutoff-lo=look> look at us <vocnois> as a showcas <sil> we're do voic <sil> over i p internet <vocnois> internet protocol <sil> which mean we're do voic and data over the same pipe <sil> and the long line carrier <sil> thei don't even know how to bill us <iver>
and i think there's an articl thi last wednesdai in the dispatch in busi section as to <sil> how <sil> the p u c o can't regul it and becaus of it thei want to deregul telecommun <sil> uh and so for the past <sil> month we haven't been get telephon bill <sil> for usag <sil> we have the backbon we're pai for <sil> and what's go to happen out of thi whole thing is <sil> <vocnois> it offer us a a <vocnois> a a lot of latitud where <vocnois> with uh <sil> we can <cutoff-n-ah=now> now <vocnois> um <sil> <vocnois> if we have a contractor let sai over in dayton <vocnois> and we're call from zanesvil <sil> offic <vocnois> i'd rather make them long distanc we can go on our pipe <vocnois> and if we have a line go over dayton <vocnois> we can make that call as if it's a local call <sil> avoid all long distanc <iver>
okai <vocnois> so our backbon still there but <vocnois> ultim <vocnois> as we get traffic uh measur <vocnois> we will be abl to downsiz the number of pipe we have <sil> so streamlin our network <iver>
and uh <vocnois> i said our our engin thei're not engin <sil> per se <vocnois> but thei ar techi that ar realli in to thi thei thei enjoi their work and <vocnois> it's for <sil> it's in the forefront <sil> of ohio govern <vocnois> along with the technolog <vocnois> there ha to also be the paperwork <vocnois> now i know realiz we have <vocnois> a paperless environ <vocnois> quot unquot <iver>
but we still need to have properti manag record that's veri essenti and a lot time when you're talk to engin thei don't <vocnois> realiz that part of it <vocnois> um thei don't like the detail <sil> at least <sil> that aspect of it <vocnois> uh but we need to have a lot of that becaus you need know how <vocnois> uh your uh <vocnois> facil ar structur <vocnois> uh the time histori <vocnois> ani type of uh <vocnois> activ on that whether it's been uh instal <vocnois> remov <vocnois> reloc <vocnois> whatev might be <sil> but we need know that how it had an impact upon the design of a the particular <vocnois> uh facil voic and data 
<vocnois> so that's basic what <vocnois> we've been do we've been progress for fifteen year <vocnois> and um <vocnois> i'm proud to sai that our state agenc is probabl the onli agenc other than mayb thi <vocnois> highwai patrol <sil> we work a lot with them <vocnois> but i think our we're the onli on that have their own wire cabl peopl <iver>
and <sil> the administr for telecommun for the state of ohio <vocnois> ar <sil> work with us as observ becaus thei don't have a staff <iver>
and um <vocnois> it it's great <sil> we've been reengin last eight year o dot downsiz <vocnois> and try to fit the uh <vocnois> uh fit the i guess the attribut the person bring to work <sil> as oppos to <vocnois> not <vocnois> on of the problem i <cutoff-f=feel> i see as an <vocnois> as an employ or <cutoff-l=?> as a supervisor <vocnois> manag <sil> <vocnois> a lot of time we have to promot becaus <sil> well <vocnois> the bureaucraci sai you have to <sil> do thi in order to get up there <vocnois> thei don't take in consider the attribut the person <ext-ha> and so now we're sai okai if you bring thi attribut to the tabl <vocnois> and you can help the team <ext-out> <vocnois> then why not reward <ext-you> <sil> instead of put you over here in let's sai a <ext-manageri> posit <vocnois> which you realli don't have ani <vocnois> <vocnois-call> for but you're there becaus the monei onli <vocnois> okai <vocnois> so we're try to fit the attribut to the person compens them accordingli <vocnois> which <vocnois> <sil> hei if <vocnois> i think we did that we'd probabl have more teacher <iver>
um <vocnois> but the <error-thr=troubl> troubl is we don't fit the <vocnois> hors with the proper carriag load <vocnois> and we need to do that in our societi we need to work as a <ext-team> <vocnois> there's no sens in have <cutoff-thr=three> <vocnois> have five guard on a basketbal team <vocnois> if you don't have a center that can tip it off and rebound <iver>
but <vocnois> we go out and look uh we look do it differ in sport but we do thi differ in the <unknown> the uh secular world <unknown> <iver>
we should look at it as <vocnois> as a sport <iver>
oh and that that's a problem in our societi and if <cutoff-s=someth> if someth can come out <sil> of the univers here <vocnois> to <ext-promot> <sil> the revers of that <vocnois> i think you have <sil> a lot less psycholog <sil> problem with peopl <vocnois> and domest problem <sil> work problem <sil> everyth <vocnois> becaus the <sil> problem come down to the fact <vocnois> well gee it's not <sil> it's not recogn yknow were <vocnois> <ext-whatev> <ext-these> <he-um> <vocnois> trend in our societi that sai well you gotta be a <vocnois> you gotta be a <vocnois> comput guru <vocnois> you gotta be <cutoff-thi=thi> <vocnois> well befor <sil> befor <vocnois> gate wa recogn <vocnois> he wa noth <iver>
to our societi <vocnois> now we he we bow to him <iver>
but what tell what doe it tell us about our peopl <sil> we're so <ext-naiv> <sil> <vocnois> we've got to look insid ourselv and sai what can we bring to societi that that that can be more benefici <vocnois> and most the time <vocnois> it's <sil> listen <iver>
not for long <iver>
you consid the hous trend <vocnois> and there <vocnois> there again that goe back to the stupid consum <vocnois> i sai stupid consum becaus <vocnois> when i wa in colleg i alwai said well <cutoff-f=fourth?> consum had a fourth grade educ level <iver>
and how <vocnois> how mani dollar doe a consum put in to research as oppos to the busi <vocnois> that's the inequ in our life <vocnois> <he-and> you're you're basic put the shaft to the consum <vocnois> <iver>
and <vocnois> until that consum becom on equal knowledg level as the <vocnois> <cutoff-mark=market> <vocnois> <he-uh> it's alwai gonna be inequit and you're gonna have a <vocnois> problem <vocnois> in our societi becaus <vocnois> we don't need these larg hous and so forth becaus as you progress in ag <vocnois> it becom a liabil <vocnois> but then the develop ar think well let's see well we can make <vocnois-condo> downsiz a littl bit but still we want make thi <sil> we want make thi margin of <ext-profit> <vocnois> yeah we do but what about for societi's <sil> best interest <iver>
<vocnois> well you us a word <vocnois> earlier in your statement <vocnois> what we <ext-should> <sil> <ext-bui> <iver>
<he-what> we should bui <vocnois> yeah the retail <vocnois> what we should bui <vocnois> and that's the <vocnois> <ext-problem> <vocnois> we listen to <vocnois> busi <sil> too <ext-much> <vocnois> if busi <vocnois> reemphas <vocnois> <vocnois> their goal to help societi out and not themselv <iver>

i think thei've tri to to uh bring the laymen in <sil> to <vocnois> <sil> more of the priest <sil> the duti of the priest <vocnois> but there's like the consecr uh of the bread and wine that <sil> that none of that ha been sanction <vocnois> <sil> thei don't perform thei don't <sil> uh <sil> uh <cutoff-t=?> <sil> um thei're not abl to give the sacrament grace for baptism confirm <vocnois> <sil> holi <cutoff-com=communion> uh well thei do holi communion <vocnois> <sil> but uh extrem unction matrimoni none of those <vocnois> uh have been deleg outsid of the duti of the priest <vocnois> <sil> but <sil> um <vocnois> <sil> i still think that it's a good uh <sil> i do think the involv of the laymen is veri import <vocnois> <sil> but i don't have ani <cutoff-qua=qualm> <sil> i i mean that doesn't bother me a bit about women <vocnois> <iver>

um-hum <iver>
bar mitzvah <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
i've never heard it said befor like you said that that the reason women aren't priest is becaus thei <cutoff-c=can't?> don't <vocnois> show ani kind of uh spiritu leadership <vocnois> <sil> i <sil> i've never heard that said <sil> and <cutoff-s=so?> there must be peopl who <sil> think that <iver>
well when thei had to cover their <cutoff-he=head?> i know all of that but i don't think that's realli been <iver>
um-hum um <iver>
i don't <sil> think so <iver>
well that's true <iver>
that's right <iver>
and thei sai not as mani european men attend mass but in in <vocnois> <sil> at church yesterdai i <sil> thought about that and i notic how mani men <vocnois> <sil> there ar who do go to church in the unit state <iver>
um-hum <iver>
um-hum <iver>
um-hum <iver>
um-hum <iver>
i've alwai thought that it it end up be <cutoff-r=?> <sil> a person decis <sil> 
<vocnois> <sil> yknow i i said to myself becaus i had post partem depress with my third and fourth child <vocnois> <sil> and i thought it <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> what good am my go to be to these children if i'm not abl to take care of them <sil> <vocnois> <sil> so <sil> decis wa said <sil> after the fourth child we would practic birth control <sil> <vocnois> so i and i felt comfort that <iver>
no becaus i think there's the ideal <vocnois> <sil> in <vocnois> everyth <vocnois> <sil> and <vocnois> if you can't live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do <sil> and uh i think that's where i wa come from <vocnois> <sil> i mean <vocnois> even now <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> <vocnois> <sil> i mean i i could never <sil> agre with abort let sai <vocnois> <sil> i i would stand by the church and and most <sil> most of the church law i do stand by <vocnois> but i guess the birth control issu becam so person <vocnois> <sil> and um <sil> it wa just a decis that had to be made and i had to make it with a <sil> what i felt wa a clear conscienc and what i did <sil> i don't have ani regret for it <vocnois> <sil> what about you <iver>
i think it ha a lot to do with the fact that the <vocnois> that thei <sil> the church <iver>
yeah <cutoff-d=?> <cutoff-f=?> <cutoff-pro=procreat> <cutoff-t=?> procreat part of <sil> what marriag is all about but i see marriag as <sil> more than just propag <iver>
so that's <sil> yknow <sil> <cutoff-ba=base> <sil> a lot of my decis were base upon that <iver>
thei haven't <nois> hum um <iver>
right <iver>
right <iver>
well and don't you think too the <cutoff-psych=psycholog> that <sil> <vocnois> <sil> the more thei have found out psycholog speak about <vocnois> children and the placement of children in the famili and the <sil> um <sil> throe of not have enough or <vocnois> <sil> or be <sil> <cutoff-s=sore> <sil> sore neglect becaus you were on of so mani i mean janet and i both <sil> know the <cutoff-ek=experi> <sil> that experi from be <vocnois> <sil> on of eleven children rais so yknow you didn't have the advantag that <iver>
um-hum <iver>
um-hum <iver>
um-hum <iver>

right <sil> <vocnois> <iver>
and of cours i think too as in america the um <sil> the <cutoff-f=farm> <sil> farm famili yknow thei want <sil> that wa more labor for the vineyard so to speak so i think that might have influenc a lot of that <vocnois> but over the year it it um <sil> it just made sens to me <vocnois> <sil> in fact it <vocnois> look like in my famili that thei're <cutoff-t=?> go <sil> the children ar go to be mostli in two <vocnois> <sil> yknow not even go to three or four <sil> i mean <error-is=it's> <sil> not over yet but my girl ar forti two and <sil> forti on <vocnois> <sil> soon to be forti on so um <vocnois> <sil> i think that their child bear year ar over <iver>

<vocnois> <iver>
hum <iver>
yeah <iver>
well <vocnois> i we were in north africa first <vocnois> for the north african <vocnois> campaign when rommel wa still <vocnois> roam and then <vocnois> when uh <vocnois> that end up <vocnois> in the summer of <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> fall of nineteen forti two i believ <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> then we <cutoff-w=we?> <sil> <vocnois> were sent to itali i wa in the field artilleri outfit <vocnois> uh six inch gun <iver>
<vocnois> and uh <vocnois> well actual <vocnois> a neighbor boi <vocnois> whose <vocnois> draft number wa <vocnois> smaller than mine <iver>
<vocnois> uh <vocnois> i don't know where he got the contact but anywai <vocnois> he <vocnois> went up to boon iowa and join a nation guard outfit <vocnois> uh <vocnois> which wa field artilleri <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> with the expect of their be mobil <vocnois> soon <vocnois> which thei were <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> so he <vocnois> he wa home on weekend and talk to me about it and i thought well <vocnois> field artilleri i wa expos to that when i wa uh <vocnois> in r o t c at am <vocnois> so i thought that's <sil> be better than <vocnois> carri a rifl and <laugh> so i went up with him and i join up <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> so anywai <vocnois> we <error-hand=had> <vocnois> six inch <vocnois> howitz <vocnois> which had a rang of <vocnois> about sixteen mile <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> the shell were <vocnois> about nineti five pound <iver>
<vocnois> and thei <vocnois> the high explos shell had thirti seven pound of t n t in them <vocnois> so thei'd make <vocnois> quit a bang when thei went off <iver>
and <vocnois> field artilleri is realli <cutoff-inter=interest> or i found it realli interest becaus <vocnois> those uh <vocnois> when you get into figur <vocnois> fire data <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> <laugh-you_can> <vocnois> get lost in mathemat almost back then you could of cours <vocnois> now thei probabl have <iver>
comput that <vocnois> figur it out and just zip zip <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> oh <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> and then thei uh <vocnois> we had to <vocnois> locat our posit on a map <iver>
and <vocnois> i didn't do that myself <vocnois> but we had a coupl boi in the outfit who <vocnois> <sil> could <vocnois> uh <vocnois> find where we were on a map and <vocnois> <sil> where our <vocnois> o p our observ post wa and <vocnois> where the enemi out here wa and all that <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> it's uh <vocnois> it <cutoff-re=realli> it is <cutoff-inter=interest> wa interest <vocnois> uh <vocnois> calcul <vocnois> try to calcul <vocnois> where your shell were gonna land out there <iver>
i wa up <cutoff-o=on> <vocnois> i wa <vocnois> onli on the o p a few time but <vocnois> on time when we <vocnois> had a uh <vocnois> second lieuten up there who wa veri <vocnois> <sil> well congeni i guess is as good a word as ani <iver>
and uh <vocnois> what we'd do is sometim <vocnois> when we'd get into an area and we'd know that we'd had a field out here we'd be shoot to <vocnois> we would adjust on a target out there we'd pick a <vocnois> <iver>
a build or some target there we could see <iver>
<vocnois> and we'd <vocnois> <cutoff-ad=adjust> adjust the gun call down <vocnois> shift <vocnois> until thei could come within <vocnois> reason <vocnois> close to that <vocnois> <iver>
and then <vocnois> we we'd know where <vocnois> to shift from there to anoth target <iver>
<vocnois> and uh <vocnois> he let me fire it <vocnois> on <laugh> onc <vocnois> rang but <vocnois> i got about <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> fifti or seventi five yard from the <vocnois> what we were shoot <laugh-at> <iver>
which would <vocnois> um <vocnois> see with those <vocnois> gun our of our we figur <vocnois> within ten <cutoff-f=feet> <vocnois> ten yard wa a hit <vocnois> wa a <cutoff-tar=target?> <vocnois> and becaus <vocnois> if you had on of those thing <vocnois> thirti seven <vocnois> pound of t n t go off within ten yard of it <laugh> <iver>
yeah <vocnois> 
<iver>
we <iver>
we had uh <vocnois> counter batteri fire we call it which <vocnois> when thei were shoot back at us <vocnois> onc <vocnois> in north africa wa <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> kind of <vocnois> scari <vocnois> uh <vocnois> we were in posit where we <vocnois> <sil> could fire on a <vocnois> a uh tank battl that wa go on we had a <error-foral-forward> <vocnois> forward observ up there <vocnois> where he could look down and see the whole thing <vocnois> and so he wa adjust fire and <vocnois> i don't know how mani <vocnois> tank thei claim that we hit but <iver>
<vocnois> cours with our <vocnois> if you hit <vocnois> you didn't have to hit them direct you could hit them right besid them and flip them over <iver>
and thei were out of it <iver>
<vocnois> so uh anywai <vocnois> <ext-we> <vocnois> we had a fine field dai that on dai <vocnois> uh fire at them <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> the next morn about ten o clock <vocnois> we heard on <cutoff-t=?> <cutoff-co=come> uh heard a shell come in and it wa an air burst back of us about five hundr yard <iver>
<vocnois> and then in a littl bit there's anoth on <vocnois> other side of us <iver>
he wa adjust on us <vocnois> and we <vocnois> <sil> couldn't do we didn't catch onto where it wa right awai but <vocnois> by the time we <vocnois> start <vocnois> look for our <laugh> hole which <vocnois> weren't deep enough <vocnois> we <vocnois> <cutoff-f=?> realiz that he wa in a clump of <vocnois> <cutoff-s=?> of cactu <iver>
over on an adjoin hill <vocnois> oh about <vocnois> half a mile awai i guess <vocnois> and he wa get even for the dai befor <iver>
but uh <vocnois> <laugh-the> <vocnois> the first lieuten who wa <vocnois> our um <vocnois> in command of the batteri at that time <vocnois> said let's get the hell out of here <iver>
so <vocnois> there wa a <vocnois> a wadi thei call them it's like a <vocnois> littl deep wash <iver>
that <vocnois> ran down <vocnois> oh a hundr two hundr yard from the gun posit so <vocnois> we took off down there <iver>
<vocnois> and thei <vocnois> proceed to set <vocnois> <sil> i think thei set two of our gun on <vocnois> the batteri i mean the <vocnois> tire on fire <iver>
<vocnois> and thei set the ammunit on fire <vocnois> thei just <vocnois> shot our gun posit up pretti good <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> and that night <vocnois> final thei <vocnois> well i don't know exactli how we <vocnois> we got a hold of back to our headquart but anywai we did and <vocnois> so thei sent the <vocnois> prime mover <vocnois> which <vocnois> the <vocnois> the truck which we move the gun with <vocnois> out <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> we hitch what wa <cutoff-rem=remain> remain <vocnois> of the gun on them and <vocnois> went back wonder now <laugh> thei gonna put us in the infantri or someth we don't have ani <vocnois> artilleri gun <vocnois> but uh <vocnois> i don't know it wasn't but <vocnois> a coupl or three dai <vocnois> thei had <vocnois> more gun i mean more artilleri piec up there for us to <vocnois> us <vocnois> and then <vocnois> on other time after in itali <vocnois> or when we were in itali <vocnois> we <cutoff-mo=move> thei move us into a posit that we should have never been in <vocnois> we were <vocnois> well let's see we come <cutoff-alo=along> uh around a mountain like there's a mountain here <iver>
<vocnois> and there not a <vocnois> real <cutoff-b=big> high mountain but a mountain <vocnois> and in the front of it there wa a littl kind of a <vocnois> dip <iver>
<vocnois> and then on out and the <vocnois> enemi wa over there <vocnois> well thei put us in the front of that mountain right down <vocnois> <iver>
<ext-where> <sil> <vocnois> i don't think that there's ani question thei could look right down our throat becaus <vocnois> and anywai we fire a <vocnois> a coupl time from there <vocnois> and thei <cutoff-s=start> start fire back at us and man <vocnois> scare me <iver>
i had my <vocnois> my head wa that far below the surfac <laugh> <iver>
in a hole and i wa still <vocnois> uh shaken <vocnois> but uh <vocnois> and i don't rememb <vocnois> i think thei put on of our gun out of commiss that time but thei didn't do <vocnois> as much damag as <vocnois> thei might have <iver>
<vocnois> those were the two worst <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> thing <vocnois> when we were in north africa <vocnois> there wa <vocnois> <sil> on <vocnois> german gun that wa <vocnois> fire on us and <vocnois> and thei couldn't figur where he wa <iver>
<vocnois> and final uh i don't know whether there were <vocnois> we had uh a <vocnois> piper cub observ plane i don't know whether he saw him <vocnois> or <vocnois> who but anywai <vocnois> thei final <vocnois> figur that he wa in a <vocnois> a <cutoff-rai=rail> a tunnel for the railroad <iver>
and he'd <iver>
pull out <iver>
fire a coupl round pull right back in <vocnois> so uh <vocnois> that night our captain who <vocnois> who's on of these <vocnois> go go gui <vocnois> took on of our gun from a gun crew <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> thei went up to where thei could <vocnois> line <cutoff-s=?> <vocnois> <cutoff-f=?> <vocnois> line <cutoff-f=?> <vocnois> aim on that <vocnois> <iver>
open of that tunnel <vocnois> and <laugh-thei> <vocnois> fire a coupl <vocnois> <sil> of our shell into the tunnel and then took off <iver>
so i don't know <vocnois> whether <cutoff-th=thei> <laugh> thei did ani damag or not but <iver>
if there were ani german in there i'll bet thei scare <laugh-them> <laugh> <iver>
no <iver>

hum <iver>
well 
<vocnois> the <vocnois> object in vietnam <vocnois> were never <vocnois> clearli delin <iver>
and thei were in itali <vocnois> and europ <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> there wasn't <vocnois> the definit <vocnois> enemi <vocnois> in vietnam that there wa in europ <vocnois> i think that's part of it <vocnois> <nois> and of cours the attitud of most of the <vocnois> gui that went to vietnam wa <vocnois> a littl bit differ from <vocnois> from where i wa probabl is a consequ of <vocnois> our understand of the <vocnois> the uh <iver>
object <vocnois> becaus uh <vocnois> when we went <nois> into the servic and then went oversea our <vocnois> object wa to <vocnois> do awai with hitler and mussolini <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> i don't know thei <vocnois> i'm just thank that he <vocnois> he wasn't in a <vocnois> carri a rifl in a rifl compani or someth becaus <vocnois> that wa rough <iver>
<nois> he uh <vocnois> told he never said much about it except he <vocnois> told about <vocnois> on time when he wa in the <vocnois> hospit <vocnois> up in japan <vocnois> after he wa burn <vocnois> he said that he wa in a <vocnois> ward with a bunch of other <vocnois> burn patient and <vocnois> and he said the <vocnois> some of them and him includ <vocnois> were abl to get up and walk around <vocnois> so the <vocnois> and i can see their philosophi the <vocnois> medic <vocnois> had the gui that could walk <vocnois> help wait on the <vocnois> gui that were bed bound <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> he wa <vocnois> had been help <vocnois> on gui that wa <vocnois> pretti bad off <nois> <vocnois> and thi gui pass awai <vocnois> didn't make it <vocnois> and so thei <vocnois> start to put orrin get warren to <vocnois> do someth els <cutoff-w=with> <vocnois> with some of the other gui <vocnois> i'm through i'm not work anymor with them he told them <vocnois> and thei swore ye you ar <vocnois> he said what ar you gonna do send me back over to vietnam <laugh> <vocnois> but thei sent him home <vocnois> but he wa <vocnois> he wa uh <vocnois> <nois> <vocnois> not a veri enthusiast soldier i don't think at ani time and <vocnois> especi after he came home <iver>

huh <iver>
yeah <iver>
i never heard a thing about it all the time i wa in the servic <iver>
<vocnois> and i don't know <vocnois> whether orrin did or not he's never said anyth if he ha <vocnois> but uh <vocnois> i think my attitud would be <vocnois> uh <vocnois> don't tell and <vocnois> you know <vocnois> uh <vocnois> the <vocnois> the gui that <cutoff-co=come> <vocnois> come out in a veri <error-vocish=vocifer> <vocnois> vocifer in favor of <vocnois> uh <vocnois> public it and all that <vocnois> i don't see <vocnois> what thei expect to gain <vocnois> i mean if <vocnois> thei <nois> <vocnois> thei uh <vocnois> in fact i don't <cutoff-s=see> <vocnois> i don't think that thei do gain anyth by it <iver>
it wasn't public to the <vocnois> degre that it is now <vocnois> it seem like anymor noth is sacr i mean as far as paper ar concern <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> there's someth els that i <vocnois> i guess i'm old fashion but i don't think <vocnois> we need all thi public about <vocnois> all the sexual escapad of all the <vocnois> peopl that ar <vocnois> <error-notari=notar?> or <cutoff-no=notori> <vocnois> have <error-notari=notori> <vocnois> live <vocnois> uh <vocnois> i just <vocnois> uh <vocnois> i think mayb i'm old fashion but i <vocnois> and thei <vocnois> i can hardli <vocnois> conceiv <vocnois> anyon be <vocnois> a genuin homosexu <vocnois> i mean evid thei ar <vocnois> um but uh <vocnois> it's so against human natur <vocnois> i think <vocnois> or against convent human natur anywai <iver>

um-hum <iver>
um-hum <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> i <sil> not realli a big fan uh <sil> i think on of the big problem is gonna be uh <sil> uh initi just the uh <sil> uh the monetari thing of it yknow the peopl that support the uh <vocnois> basic support the uh <sil> uh minor leagu team that thei had here yknow uh were like blue collar peopl and that <sil> you go for twenti thirti buck and <sil> have a good time get drunk throw beer and <sil> and up there yknow you're not gonna be abl to do that it's gonna cost you uh <sil> a minimum of fifti to a hundr dollar probabl take a famili there <sil> coupl of kid or someth like that yknow <iver>
<vocnois> well the minor leagu hockei team the columbu chill ar never there <sil> um-hum <sil> thei don't have it now but uh becaus the blue jacket came in but <vocnois> but <sil> i think it'd be good if it goe but <sil> i'm just not sure that <sil> columbu is gonna support someth like that <sil> and it's basic ohio state yknow <sil> and thei don't even support the uh <sil> hockei team we got <error-fra=for> ohio state yknow <sil> and yet thei're good <iver>

<vocnois> well the uh wolff famili and uh <sil> the mcconnel have been around forev yknow <sil> uh worthington industri and <sil> and the wolff famili's columbu dispatch uh <sil> uh then you got uh i think it's rozutti <sil> uh he's like a <sil> wa a construct gui so uh <vocnois> uh <sil> thei've been around forev and everyth and uh <sil> thei <sil> can get their wai through uh <sil> polit arena and everyth <cutoff-e=els> but i think most the monei wa uh <sil> wa privat monei <sil> but thei were given like tax incent and <unknown-stuff?> thing of that natur <iver>
the old <cutoff-pen=penitentiari> <iver>
um-hum <sil> yeah it's an <cutoff-o=old> it wa an old eyesor that thei should have got rid of year ago but <iver>
um-hum <iver>
well i think thei tri to get some kind of a deal with uh <sil> when thei were plan thi thing and with uh <sil> with ohio state to <sil> uh <sil> yknow like have the schottenstein center down at uh <sil> down closer to downtown or <sil> or someth like that <sil> and plai half your ball game there or someth like that but <sil> but ohio state don't need that yknow thei got their own stuff <sil> so <iver>

yeah <laugh> <sil> yeah and that's the thing about school too <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> i <vocnois> total disagre with uniform <sil> yknow unless it's <sil> all slack <sil> all of it <vocnois> becaus you get the <vocnois> the girl in the uniform and thei're short <sil> and thei can't enforc that thei don't enforc that <sil> and the dai that my daughter came home and told me that thi on teacher put the whole the girl up in the front row <sil> i should have went and met him <sil> or i should have said hei yknow hei thi uh yknow <vocnois> haven't met me and i and i realli <vocnois> yknow fault myself for that <sil> but it's made me more awar too and i <sil> yknow when you look at someon and you sai oh you would never dream that thei <vocnois> well i do <sil> yknow there isn't anyth i don't <sil> put past anybodi do <vocnois> i realli don't caus thei just <sil> yeah <sil> oh <laugh> <laugh=no> no no i do becaus there's some good on out there there's some bad on too but yknow <iver>
yeah <vocnois> um it's awar again <sil> i mean <sil> yknow put two and two togeth you get some young <vocnois> teacher <sil> right out of of colleg <sil> and then you put em with all these high school girl and these girl ar look like twenti and twenti two i mean <vocnois> you can't even <sil> you can't control the attract there <sil> but you can be awar of it <sil> and you can <sil> you can um <vocnois> <sil> put the put slack on girl and not leav it up to them to choos the height of their skirt and <vocnois> yknow and <vocnois> thei've got stair up and down and <vocnois> yknow thei get in their locker and thei bend over yknow and that's <sil> that's just too much <vocnois> i mean i think that's the first thing that ha to be done take awai <vocnois> that yknow thei shouldn't even be <vocnois> uh that shouldn't even be a thought <sil> yknow <vocnois> and it's distract enough for the the gui their own ag <vocnois> but then you put these young teacher in there mayb thei're singl gui that were just had a hell of a time in hall in colleg <vocnois> and then thei get around all these girl and like oh my gosh <vocnois> well yknow you gotta look at that you gotta be more awar <iver>
<vocnois> um <sil> i think <sil> i think that there should be <sil> a mandatori becaus you have it in big compani you have mandatori um sexual harass tape <sil> and <sil> and you learn you teach the girl <sil> that it's not what thei do it's how thei make you feel <sil> is is <sil> constitut as your uh <sil> yeah harass there <sil> and thei're too afraid <sil> and then besid that thei yknow there's crush on yknow you can't fault the girl for have crush and <vocnois> thing like that thei're go through enough thing as it is <iver>
but you can make them awar if somebodi <sil> as an adult step over that <sil> line <sil> or make them uncomfort <sil> yknow <vocnois> there should be some kind of a s <sil> a system <sil> to where these girl the slightest bit <sil> yknow it's anonym it's <sil> yknow <iver>
probabl but thei don't thei won't <sil> yknow <vocnois> part of is thei feel flatter part of it is like wow the yknow thi gui think i'm nice look or whatev 
<vocnois> and yknow you can have a hard thing there but <vocnois> then if you teach the teacher that thei're not gonna be quiet and thei're not gonna <vocnois> yknow um look at thi flatteri <iver>

<sil> the three r's <vocnois> yknow i think those ar still veri import <iver>
becaus you do have to have a higher educ <sil> most of the time to do anyth <vocnois> these dai so <vocnois> thei definit have to have their <iver>
ground at there so thei can go forward <iver>

yeah <vocnois> <sil> <iver>
<sil> <nois> <sil> <iver>
it's okai <iver>
i don't know like i think <cutoff-hi=high> <sil> i think uh high school in gener like thei i peopl alwai talk about rais the standard you know <vocnois> <sil> for high <vocnois> <ext-for> high school thing but <sil> um <sil> <nois> <vocnois> i think <sil> um <sil> <vocnois> it's kind of like <vocnois> <sil> it's <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it's realli hard <vocnois> to to <vocnois> <sil> like i've thought about befor just what's <sil> <vocnois> wrong with like the educ system in gener <sil> <vocnois> <sil> like <sil> <vocnois> i don't know i think it's more of a <vocnois> <sil> more of like a <sil> <vocnois> it's <sil> <vocnois> colleg is a littl bit differ i guess but it's more of like thi whole like <sil> <vocnois> <sil> the teacher <sil> <vocnois> the teacher's talk <vocnois> and it like it like the inform goe from like <vocnois> the <cutoff-profe=profess> <sil> like the teacher's <sil> <vocnois> <sil> uh mouth to the student's note with like out <cutoff-go=go> <cutoff-w=with> without go through either of their brain you know it's like just from like real monoton and like you know date and blah blah blah about <sil> <vocnois> <sil> you know just like <cutoff-re=real> it's it's a <vocnois> <sil> it's real structur but it's real hard to think about <sil> what then what i could what to do to chang that <vocnois> it's kind of like more <sil> <vocnois> like <sil> <vocnois> i don't know i mean i had realli good like there wa a coupl realli good teacher like my histori <cutoff-tea=teacher> teacher and english teacher were realli good <vocnois> um <sil> <iver>
<sil> just becaus <vocnois> you know <sil> it wa more <vocnois> <sil> like <sil> thei seem like thei want to be there as oppos to <vocnois> <sil> i'm just do thi <cutoff-f=for> becaus i don't know why or whatev and it seem like too <vocnois> <sil> thei thei <sil> <vocnois> i hate it when peopl <sil> it's obviou that if thei didn't have the textbook thei wouldn't know how to do it <vocnois> you know like where if peopl didn't have their note like thei wouldn't be abl to do it themselv you know <vocnois> it's kind of like <sil> <vocnois> um <vocnois> and so i think <vocnois> <cutoff-i=it's> it's <cutoff-i=it's> <sil> that when peopl have real enthusiasm and like <cutoff-y=you_know> or and <sil> put a lot of effort into make it not the same everydai not just like a lectur and when then we do <vocnois> <sil> homework and turn it in like you know it's like <vocnois> we do <vocnois> <sil> like <vocnois> like in histori class we do like role <vocnois> role plai thing and like <iver>
plai <unknown> like we like just thing that ar differ and like <vocnois> my sociolog and psycholog teacher were real good he did he wa the same gui who taught histori <vocnois> <sil> he wa real good too like it wa realli crazi obvious but like <vocnois> it's just like <vocnois> interest <vocnois> um <sil> like the sociolog of high school and like have a sociolog class about a <unknown> <vocnois> just <sil> <vocnois> <laugh> <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> well well it's sort of like the sociolog of like cliqu you know <vocnois> like how <sil> how that develop like <vocnois> how peopl <vocnois> like some peopl seek <vocnois> to <sil> like <sil> fit in <sil> like <sil> like <cutoff-that=that's> that's a real strong uh <vocnois> like <vocnois> 
<vocnois> <cutoff-y=you_know> <cutoff-h=how> uh just how like too <vocnois> how there's no real <sil> <vocnois> like <vocnois> everybodi conform to their <sil> own set of norm in each group yknow it's like <sil> peopl <vocnois> no matter like yknow even if ted kaczynski is out <vocnois> like <vocnois> <cutoff-oh> uh on <vocnois> yknow wherev in like hi littl shed <vocnois> yknow he's still a part of societi like how you can't get <he-awai> from societi and just how like <vocnois> how societi develop in gener like how high school's like <vocnois> <sil> is <vocnois> is kind of true to life but then realli differ too on how life is but just how <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it's just a <sil> a more of a <vocnois> like <sil> more of a closeknit thing so it's more appar how how segreg work or whatev <vocnois> <iver>

<vocnois> depend on <vocnois> <vocnois> who's the manag is the time everi manag's got a differ agenda on what's <sil> thei want you to do <iver>
<vocnois> i thought it <sil> wa stupid <iver>
yeah <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> well <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> thei need to strike don't get me wrong that's not the stupid part <vocnois> but the part <ext-wa> uh <vocnois> a major of them sai that thei were here for ten year and ain't make that much monei most peopl would move on <iver>
the univers never ha monei that's like me when i <sil> first came here the univers wa not pai me noth i work two <cutoff-yiyr=year> <vocnois> or two job for ten year when i wa here the first ten year just to make a live <iver>
yeah <sil> and uh <vocnois> i had the prerog i coulda gone somewher els and made more monei <vocnois> yknow but well what the bad part wa is univers's try to do awai with civil servic <vocnois> civil servic is a good thing and a bad <sil> thing <vocnois> yknow you do <vocnois> you had <vocnois-step> rais and everyth so it least you did have an increas back then nowadai you have noth <iver>
it's like where i work at <vocnois> the onli wai i can get rais is by be <sil> uh <vocnois> like the kid us to sai a tattletal <sil> squealer whatev you wanna call <iver>
onli wai i can get a rais over there where work at <iver>
to be a rat <iver>
yeah <iver>
and it's not <iver>
and that's not right so i've alwai gotten two percent rais <sil> even though <vocnois> <sil> uh <vocnois> <sil> basic <vocnois> <sil> i been cross-train or howev you wanna sai it i can work in three or four area where most peopl can't <vocnois> but i've seen peopl get ten percent rais <sil> and i've seen me get two percent rais when i'm do three job and thei're do on <iver>
but it <vocnois> i'm us me as exampl becaus i've seen a lot of other peopl do the same thing don't get me wrong <iver>
but it just depend upon it still come back to who you know <iver>
becaus thei done awai with the uh <vocnois> <sil> civil servic step rais which were wrong caus coulda done crummi job and got same rais as do a good job don't get me wrong <vocnois> but now <vocnois> it is that you got <vocnois> <sil> peopl you don't even respect in manag a lot of time give the rais and thei <vocnois> <sil> have no idea what you're even do <iver>
<cutoff-eyg=exampl?> <sil> exampl that i ask my manag the other dai she told me i wa suppos to do thi <vocnois> certain thing and i ask her i said well <vocnois> thei told me i wasn't suppos to <vocnois> <iver>
and she said she'd get back to me on it <sil> well never heard noth from her <vocnois> <sil> and she's done that to me i don't know how mani time <iver>
but yet that leav the door open for who to get in troubl <iver>
yeah <iver>
make her look good <iver>
<vocnois> well <iver>
it's just like your <cutoff-pii=peopl> peopl you see go to church that walk out of church see somebodi sit there that's homeless <iver>
thei'll ignor them won't thei <vocnois> <sil> becaus thei're in their good sundai cloth <iver>
well basic the same thing here <vocnois> but <sil> some of your manag is real good i've seen peopl that <sil> that <sil> yknow ar super <vocnois> but i've seen peopl that ar bad problem is you get a bad manag <sil> and it can make your life hell i don't care who you ar <vocnois> <iver>
<unknown> nice manag <vocnois> <iver>
so yknow what i mean <sil> i can outlast them <iver>

let me ask you thi <sil> where the <sil> where's the nearest teen club <sil> there is none <sil> where's the nearest playground there is none <sil> where's the nearest sport center there is none <vocnois> <sil> so <laugh-basic> there's not a whole lot to do except for the hang out <vocnois> so yeah i think societi as a whole <unknown> more violent <vocnois> the kid ar more violent look at the new you see on tv everi dai you see peopl get mad just <sil> caus thei're sit in traffic <iver>
that's adult <iver>
see peopl <vocnois> now all sudden there's a rash of fire <sil> you read that in new peopl keep do it <vocnois> i think societi as a whole <vocnois> ha gotten lot more violent which made the kid more violent <iver>
i don't think it's the cartoon caus come on if thei're that stupid <vocnois> yknow what i mean thei thei shouldn't even be out on the street i'm sorri <iver>
caus that's like me i watch the three stoog and you don't see me put no crowbar up nobodi's nose <iver>

the <cutoff-m=major> major ar the on that don't get the guidanc <sil> at home <sil> that you're try to reach ain't gonna go to boi scout <iver>
<laugh> <laugh-yknow> <iver>
<he-uh> <vocnois> basic what you need more is <vocnois> like recreat center or someth in their own neighborhood <iver>
where thei can go everydai <sil> the wai i look at it <vocnois> also <ext-too> <he-uh> <sil> when i wa a kid like i said i start work two job when i wa fourteen you can't even find a job unless you're sixteen nowadai <iver>
so it's kinda hard you know what i mean <cutoff-t=to> <sil> to do a lotta thing <iver>
becaus <cutoff-thei=thei're> <cutoff-thei=thei're> thei're sai you're still a kid but yet 
you know what i mean <vocnois> can't do thi you can't do that <iver>
<vocnois> yeah <iver>

ain't a damn thing thei're scare of whenev we were kid we us to make zip gun <vocnois> we'd take an ink pen <sil> take the pen piec out put a firecrack in <iver>
put so it fizz and yknow you'd pack it full and you had a gun <iver>
you know that the stuff like that's <sil> alwai been around <vocnois> but it seem now that <sil> the gun ar more <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> <sil> you can get them easier <vocnois> it's like me i could be carri a gun right now what ar thei gonna do to me <iver>
thei ain't gonna lock me up <iver>
carri a conceal weapon thei're gonna slap me on the arm <iver>
now if i shoot you thei might do <cutoff-sahm=someth> i mean don't get me wrong i ain't <vocnois> but i mean if i shoot you thei might do someth but otherwis than that thei ain't gonna do noth <iver>
depend upon how i store it now <vocnois> when i wa a kid rais up we had gun lock on our gun even though i could pick them <sil> i mean it <iver>
gun lock ar easi to pick you can break into anyth <vocnois> uh <vocnois> <sil> but when i wa a kid too we us go out turkei shoot and i'd go hunt all the time <vocnois> so i wa pretti familiar with gun <vocnois> my kid uh he grew up he wa familiar with gun <sil> he also knew not to touch them <iver>
if you know what i mean <vocnois> but i had no pistol at my hous i had shotgun and rifl <vocnois> now to me a lot of these pistol like a twenti five calib <sil> come on there is no us for gun like that <iver>
thirti eight derring yknow <iver>
the onli time the us for gun like that is to carri to shoot somebodi <vocnois> when i <cutoff-w=work?> <vocnois> yeah when <iver>
when i work at bar i carri a gun constantli and <vocnois> most the cop in neighborhood knew i carri a gun <iver>
but thei didn't sai noth to me becaus thei knew the reason why <sil> it's becaus i carri the bar receipt <vocnois> now i could see to carri on to that <sil> degre but <vocnois> <sil> there're <sil> you know there's a limit you got all these peopl carri gun becaus thei'll tell you well it's the neighborhood i live in or you have women carri gun even down here on campu <vocnois> becaus thei walk late at night <iver>

them littl electr shock thing <iver>
i got a bad heart i don't know what that'd do to me <iver>
<vocnois> yeah but <vocnois> gun ar alwai gonna be around ain't gonna get rid of them <iver>
but why would you make stricter gun law when you can't even enforc your traffic law <iver>
yknow so basic <vocnois> well yeah it might work but to me it's kinda stupid yknow becaus what you're sai is <vocnois> we're gonna take thi <vocnois> law and <ext-realli> gonna stick you on thi <vocnois> law but the hell with all the other law <sil> so is that realli fair <iver>
i <iver>

yknow just turn right out front of you <vocnois> everybodi's run red light nowadai <vocnois> mean which law you gonna pick out to enforc and which law ain't you <iver>
uh <sil> to me if you gonna enforc the gun law and make them <sil> stricter <vocnois> what you ought to do is <sil> put a limit <vocnois> on the barrel length and stuff on gun you get caught with a gun <vocnois> with a <cutoff-sg=?> <sil> barrel smaller than uh <sil> eight inch you go to jail <iver>
no and if or but you go to jail for three year <iver>
if you got an eight inch barrel on your gun now you tell me where ar you gonna put it <iver>
you isn't gonna get a lot of date <iver>
<laugh-yknow> <iver>

<vocnois> yeah <iver>
well <vocnois> you can carri a weapon here in columbu <sil> i can carri a weapon right now as long as out the open <iver>

<laugh> <iver>
um-hum <vocnois> yeah i am just learn the area so <vocnois> but i like it so far it seem realli nice <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> ah it seem like there's a lot more to do in columbu obvious <vocnois> but <iver>
my mom teach there <vocnois> so it's free tuition i get a tuition waiver <iver>
so <vocnois> and i figur i have a hundr <vocnois> up to a hundr and fifti four credit <vocnois> and so <vocnois> i'm to i'm up to like nineti four right now and i figur that would be a decent <vocnois> i mean it translat over becaus we're on semest <vocnois> it will <sil> get all mess up there but <sil> <he-it's> it's like <vocnois> i'm <vocnois> half wai to three fourth done with uh with my degre so <vocnois> if i want to transfer now would be like becaus i after thi point if i stai ani longer <vocnois> a lot of the credit won't transfer over it would <vocnois> be a wast of time <vocnois> becaus most place don't like to take more than half <nois> so <vocnois> that's why i just figur right now i should look <iver>
yeah exactli exactli <iver>
no it uh like i'm a busi major and i hear the busi school here is pretti good <vocnois> so uh i want to take a look at that and my roommat is a busi major so he he wa go to show me around the thei have new build i guess <vocnois> so he said he would show me around there <vocnois> uh <vocnois> also i <vocnois> i realli do like i came down for few game and thing like that and <vocnois> i like the enthusiasm that peopl have for thi place like ashland is so small <vocnois> there's a select group that ha enthusiasm <vocnois> but <vocnois> noth like here i mean thi is <laugh-ridicul> everyon is just enthusiast about the univers and <vocnois> <he-even> there might be thing thei don't like specif about the univers there uh <vocnois> i <vocnois> you don't hear <cutoff-m_eh=mani> ani <vocnois> like <vocnois> like univers neg thing about thi <vocnois> about the univers ever <iver>
yeah <vocnois> i hear <iver>
yeah it's ridicul i mean <vocnois> plu it a nation recogn school so a degre from ohio state <vocnois> i mean you could go anywher in the nation someon's at least gonna recogn becaus it's big <vocnois> it's big big name ashland it'd be more of a sell i'd be like okai we it's small it's privat it's accredit <vocnois> but still <iver>
yeah it's realli expens but that's why i went there for now i wouldn't go there it wa actual my last choic <vocnois> uh for univers but i went there <vocnois> becaus the price <laugh> <iver>
it's in in educ it's it's top thei produc a lot of graduat and undergradu uh educ <vocnois> busi school is come up <vocnois> like thei're build a new build but by the i'll be gone by the time it's done if i decid to stai <vocnois> so it's it'll be <vocnois> so <vocnois> as far as uh educ like for small school and thei just open up their phd program in educ <vocnois> and thei're also known for polit scienc <vocnois> but it's a real conserv polit scienc <vocnois> it's a real conserv school and that doesn't realli match my <vocnois> my view on a lot of thing um like thei it's dry <vocnois> thei have uh <vocnois> real strict visit polici thing like that <vocnois> my thought is if you're <vocnois> if you're if you're consid an adult enough to move awai then you shouldn't have <vocnois> that mani restrict i can understand some becaus <vocnois> i rememb when i wa a freshman in colleg it wa <vocnois> we did crazi thing but still <iver>
oh yeah <vocnois> yeah <vocnois> veri much so <iver>
yeah it's a <vocnois> you can if you're if <vocnois> you can't go to a girl dorm <vocnois> until <cutoff-m=mayb> <cutoff-m=mayb> i think mayb the afternoon <vocnois> i think mayb eleven i'm not sure <vocnois> uh <vocnois> but you have to be out by a certain time <vocnois> uh it's not as bad as like malon like i don't know if you've heard about malon thei have like certain dai so it's not like that but <vocnois> it's still just a pain <iver>
you're allow to have guest of the same sex like it <cutoff-s_eh=sai> <cutoff-ih=it> like <vocnois> i don't live in the dorm but assum i did if i <cutoff-w_ah=want> if i had a girl come from home to visit me i'd have to <vocnois> either sneak her in <laugh> and like just hope we didn't get caught or <vocnois> have her stai at a friend <iver>
like uh at a <vocnois> girl friend's of mine <iver>
a lot a lot of peopl <iver>
yeah yeah <vocnois> so it's kinda <unknown> and the univers know that's go on so <iver>
thei just <vocnois> i'm not sure realli what thei do <iver>
no thi real like to live off campu <vocnois> you have to well <vocnois> after my class it'll be twenti two and senior credit statu <vocnois> but my class wa twenti on <vocnois> or senior <vocnois> or senior credit so i got to move off campu <vocnois> but like had i been a year younger i wouldn't have been abl to becaus thei have to wait until twenti two <vocnois> so thei're <iver>
yeah you're not allow <iver>
no it's veri much so <iver>
veri much so becaus there's two thousand undergradu <vocnois> and basic eighteen hundr of them live on campu <vocnois> and then if you live off campu like <vocnois> i'd like to think i don't have troubl make friend but like that <vocnois> but i've had friend get arrest by the polic becaus <vocnois> after ten thirti like the univers <vocnois> there's thei're vehicl thei 
<vocnois> of uh all the off campu <sil> kid to like <vocnois> to the polic <vocnois> and so like <vocnois> thei'd start drive around around ten thirti try and bust them for nois <vocnois> on the weekend <vocnois> so <vocnois> it's pretti hectic <iver>
yeah exactli that's what it's a veri conserv town and the <iver>
and it's a veri <vocnois> it seem to be a fairli conserv <vocnois> uh <cutoff-u=univers> <vocnois> univers as well so <iver>
yeah i think if i make the transfer i'll definit be happi about it <iver>
definit <iver>
like <sil> polit is that what <cutoff-ch=you> <vocnois> oh well like um <vocnois> like i wa in high school i wa involv in like the democrat <sil> in the democrat campaign and <vocnois> just stuff like that just <vocnois> uh i'd like to do someth <nois> <vocnois> <unknown> <sil> i <unknown> <vocnois> learn <laugh-more> about the environ becaus thi job <vocnois> but i'd like to do someth <vocnois> otherwis like a <vocnois> a lot of like <vocnois> busi leader <vocnois> uh <vocnois> thei're veri <vocnois> thei becom veri conserv when thei get higher up becaus like the tax break thei wanna support thing like that <vocnois> but i think there should be a good mix <vocnois> like <vocnois> uh <cutoff-th=there> <sil> there there could still be <vocnois> like a think tank of <vocnois> of execut that <sil> could be veri liber and thei're think and <vocnois> just <vocnois> you know for social <vocnois> for social <vocnois> not so much social chang but <vocnois> you know not <vocnois> not um encourag sweat shop within the corpor <error-thu-=stuff> stuff like that and i'd like to <cutoff-ge=get> <vocnois> i don't know how i would get involv in someth like that but i would like to <vocnois> it'd be interest <iver>
that would be neat <vocnois> that'd be real neat <laugh> but <vocnois> that's <sil> dream world so <iver>
i have to get a job and <vocnois> support myself so <iver>
that'll come later mayb when i retir <vocnois> wai <iver>
wai in the futur <iver>
<vocnois> i don't know <vocnois> i would like to think <vocnois> i'd like to sai no sit here but you never know becaus <vocnois> <cutoff-e=?> <vocnois> i guess that's <cutoff-i=?> caus that's what happen to a lot of them yknow thei <cutoff-beco=becom> thei come out of school all idealist and then thei go <vocnois> into industri and then <vocnois> thei're mold and <vocnois> assum thei make upper manag <vocnois> <cutoff-y=you> there's <vocnois> you want the tax break you want <vocnois> <cutoff-thing=thing> <vocnois> you know what i mean and then <vocnois> thei uh <vocnois> like i have an uncl who's a vice presid on wall street <vocnois> for merril lynch and <vocnois> he said <vocnois> you know he <vocnois> he got out of school he wa veri idealist but <vocnois> now <vocnois> he <vocnois> he's <vocnois> he's like all those peopl thei should <sil> you know i'd <cutoff-m=made> <vocnois> i made it through myself and he's not for like the <vocnois> you know but <vocnois> realist he didn't <vocnois> but <iver>
you lose sight of that i think <vocnois> you know what i mean and <vocnois> lot of these gui becom real <vocnois> egotist <vocnois> i mean i like my uncl and everyth but <iver>
you know you know what i mean <iver>
no not at all <vocnois> i think <vocnois> in the unit state <vocnois> it's the drive forc of our <vocnois> of our <sil> of our govern and <vocnois> and even like <vocnois> caus <cutoff-y=you> <vocnois> without without <vocnois> a revenu base from the tax <vocnois> of corpor <vocnois> the you couldn't have nearli the thing that we've had <vocnois> and i think <vocnois> to a degre thei've becom <vocnois> fairli power but i don't think that's necessarili a bad thing <vocnois> uh <vocnois> when the union were realli strong i thought <vocnois> like we were <vocnois> i wa read about it i thought <vocnois> that wa a good thing as well becaus that support <cutoff-th=the> <vocnois> support the person but you could <vocnois> if you have good relat with your labor <sil> you don't necessarili need a union <iver>
and a lot time union <vocnois> uh thei <error-akchisii=actual> <vocnois> actual seem detriment <vocnois> like <vocnois> to product and <vocnois> to like the actual individu need of the member of the union <vocnois> becaus <vocnois> the if the union becom power you can feel free to call off and <vocnois> thing like that and <vocnois> like <vocnois> that that can actual make it wors becaus then the corpor see <vocnois> these lazi a lazi union as repres <sil> of <vocnois> of these worker so thei're more apt outsid <iver>
yeah i wa <cutoff-w=?> <vocnois> i wa drive by the <vocnois> the honk and everyth so yeah my roommat and i got into a <sil> a debat about it <vocnois> but <vocnois> it <vocnois> we didn't realli resolv it <iver>
becaus <nois> conceiv thei want <vocnois> uh what wa it a two dollar rais <vocnois> or someth <vocnois> but <vocnois> and then thei also get free tuition but onli <vocnois> as i understand it onli <vocnois> a veri small percentag get that free tuition <vocnois> or like <iver>
exercis that <iver>
that <cutoff-ri-right> <iver>
yeah <vocnois> like thei all get the option but i <cutoff-f=feel> <vocnois> i understand veri few exercis it <vocnois> so <vocnois> you know if you were to not give them <sil> the the tuition that thei could <vocnois> that <vocnois> most of them ar us and then give them the two dollar an hour <vocnois> you know <vocnois> the but then <vocnois> that could <vocnois> then you could sai that o s u's help to keep peopl down and so you have to still <sil> it's a it's an odd balanc there <vocnois> it is <vocnois> and <vocnois> like <vocnois> uh it's someth like that doesn't seem too skill to me so the i don't realli know why there's much of a union for that but <vocnois> yeah <sil> obvious the <iver>
yeah it doe it's not like a skill profess to me i think <iver>
yeah the protect <vocnois> <iver>
um hum <iver>
yeah there's no distinct <iver>
oh thei were help out the the new <laugh-gui> <iver>
oh yeah <vocnois> but he ha to still support the union so <vocnois> yeah that's <vocnois> that's a rough place to be in <vocnois> but a <vocnois> doe the union like when peopl go on strike doe the union help support the peopl that aren't get paid then or <iver>
oh <iver>
i see <iver>
um hum <iver>
realli <iver>
yeah yeah that's <nois> that's interest <iver>
realli <iver>
broke the <vocnois> the <vocnois> strike <vocnois> if you're part of the union and you just decid to go back and sai forget it <sil> thei can't pai you <vocnois> yeah and i don't see too mani peopl work for free <iver>
so <vocnois> <iver>
um <vocnois> in gener i <ext-think> <vocnois> i think <vocnois> the unit state ha <vocnois> <sil> a fairli well develop like class <vocnois> not like <sil> class structur in which you can't move up or down <vocnois> but like <vocnois> we have a <cutoff-f=fairli> <sil> a fairli larg middl class <iver>
um sector and i think that's a good sign <vocnois> but i think <vocnois> there's <vocnois> a huge there's <vocnois> million of children that don't have ani healthcar and that's not right there's <vocnois> like <vocnois> there's a lot of <vocnois> like between the lower and the upper there's a huge dispar <vocnois> but <vocnois> at least it's a step in the right direct we have a <vocnois> a nice solid middl <error-inclung=incom> <sil> middl <cutoff-inco=incom> <sil> <unknown> <vocnois> middl incom base i think <vocnois> becaus a lot of countri onli have the <sil> like <vocnois> i visit mexico and <vocnois> seem like thei onli had the distinct between <vocnois> the upper and lower i mean their middl class is veri small <vocnois> and that uh but that economi is <vocnois> come along too and i mean it <vocnois> it'll be <cutoff-f=?> <sil> it's develop itself which is <vocnois> which is nice i took a tour of <sil> a plant down there <vocnois> caus my my old <vocnois> my old man had busi down there so i went down <vocnois> just to see it and <vocnois> like <vocnois> it it seem like it wa come along and thei treat their worker better <vocnois> grant those worker make the equival of like seven buck a dai <vocnois> but <vocnois> thei get <cutoff-si=?> thei get buse into work becaus <vocnois> none of them have car <vocnois> and then on top of that <vocnois> thei all get a meal <vocnois> becaus <vocnois> there <vocnois> like <vocnois> like a hot meal like thei have a cafeteria there becaus <vocnois> i wa talk to the <vocnois> the <cutoff-m=manag> on of the manag and he said <vocnois> if we don't do that <sil> then <vocnois> thei won't be think about the <vocnois> our qualiti <sil> and <vocnois> thei'll be think about get food and thei'll be hungri so <sil> it hurt our qualiti <vocnois> so for them it wa worth it and i <iver>
<vocnois> i'd like to see that implement someth like that in the unit state that'd be a neat thing <vocnois> you know <vocnois> becaus <vocnois> like <vocnois> i know like iron foundri and uh some like <vocnois> like the lower pai job <vocnois> like <vocnois> thei have peopl that ar illiter and thing like that <vocnois> and thei can't <vocnois> like give <vocnois> paycheck out on thursdai becaus <sil> everyon will call off on fridai caus thei all go out and get drunk or <vocnois> i don't know what thei do with their pai check i know that's a <ext-big> big problem <iver>
but like if you said i we'll have a bu servic we'll go and pick you gui up <vocnois> you know and then then you can't us the excus my car broke down or someth <vocnois> and then like if you <unknown> <vocnois> even you give them a <vocnois> like <vocnois> doesn't even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anyth you know if you're on three shift you can just <vocnois> you know here's the box of donut and some milk or someth <vocnois> you know that doesn't cost the compani that much <cutoff-con=compar> <vocnois> <iver>
compar to <vocnois> you you'll have more loyalti i would think <sil> and at the same time <vocnois> those peopl won't be think about be hungri while thei're on the line <vocnois> work for you <iver>
so <iver>
yeah exactli <vocnois> you can bring that in hous i think <vocnois> i mean <vocnois> i don't know i might go out like <vocnois> like we said and <vocnois> be <sil> complet wrong <vocnois> so <iver>
yeah 
<iver>
yeah it's a qualit type <cutoff-ah=analysi> <sil> analysi <iver>
exactli <nois> <vocnois> <iver>
yeah thei're veri quantit as oppos to like the qualiti <vocnois> and then so <vocnois> the analysi is all about bottom line and the number becaus <vocnois> actual that's why i don't like <vocnois> like i like busi and i <vocnois> i enjoi my busi class but <vocnois> some of the peopl in my busi class i can not stand becaus thei honestli thei're like <vocnois> oh it doesn't matter how you treat peopl and then <vocnois> it's all about the bottom line well <sil> thei'll <cutoff-en=end> <vocnois> in my <vocnois-opinion> thei'll end up lose more becaus <sil> it cost a lot to hire a new employe <vocnois> and if you have constant turnov thing like <ext-that> <vocnois> then <sil> and if you have a product and <sil> that <sil> becaus obvious peopl aren't gonna <ext-care> <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> so <nois> <vocnois> and thei thei're thei seem veri close-mind like <vocnois> like thi is the wai busi ha to <ext-be> <vocnois> but the professor don't seem to <sil> be necessarili like that <vocnois> mayb i'm come too far <sil> go to on extrem <iver>
but the professor seem more <cutoff-center=center> <sil> center to me thei're like <vocnois> you have to balanc it which i'm sure is the truth <vocnois> yknow you can't <vocnois> diminish all your bottom line <he-for> <sil> yknow make your worker <nois-feel> good but <sil> there's still someth to it i think <iver>
yeah <nois> <iver>
<laugh-exactli> <iver>
exactli <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
<vocnois> see i'm not sure if univers health <sil> health care would be <cutoff-th=the> <vocnois> <he-the> <sil> the thing <vocnois> <he-uh> <sil> i think it wa <vocnois> my freshman year <vocnois> my sister and i went to <vocnois> donna shale the <he-uh> <iver>
the <he-um> <vocnois> whitehous like <iver>
<vocnois-person> on <vocnois> she's <vocnois-pretti> high up i guess i wa <cutoff-un=unawar> unawar <iver>
yeah <vocnois> she she had a talk and my sister and i attend and <sil> i don't like the problem i think with univers healthcar would be <vocnois> everyon don't you think like everyon with the littlest scratch would go in <vocnois> yknow <cutoff-a=as> <sil> as oppos <he-to> <vocnois> like the veri <cutoff-mu=?> <sil> and <cutoff-ne=that> i think that could drive cost up <vocnois> so there ha to be a wai to balanc it i'm not sure how you would go about do that <vocnois> becaus you don't wanna <vocnois-put> a limit and sai okai you <vocnois-can> onli go three time a year <iver>
becaus then yknow what if someth major happen that fourth time then what <vocnois> but <vocnois> i <vocnois-think> <sil> i at least for children especi becaus thei have no <ext-mean> <sil> to to help themselv <vocnois> and like <vocnois> the <vocnois-parent> <sil> obvious <sil> even if thei're work a lot of time can't get healthcar for their children <vocnois> so i think <sil> at least for children <vocnois> becaus how mani accid happen to children like <sil> peopl ar alwai <sil> break arm and stuff <iver>
yknow and <vocnois> without health insur that will cost a few hundr dollar <vocnois> and thei have no mean to help themselv at least if you <vocnois> assum you're eighteen <vocnois> you <vocnois-could> get a job like <sil> and try and <sil> <vocnois-pai> for your health insur i mean it i'm not sai it'd be easi but still <iver>
it's more feasibl than <vocnois> a six year old <iver>
yknow <vocnois> so i think mayb <vocnois> not univers health care but <sil> for children i think it'd be help <iver>
yeah <cutoff-exac=exactli> medicaid i think <sil> i think <sil> it <cutoff-i=it's> <iver>
it's <vocnois> thei're alwai synonym but <iver>
but thei're uh <sil> becaus thei're both govern program but yeah <sil> but i <vocnois-think> <sil> like i said for the <vocnois> for the younger peopl becaus <vocnois> <sil> it is <sil> <cutoff-ay=?> becaus it's not their fault their parent can't get <sil> <vocnois-health> <sil> health care <sil> so <vocnois> <sil> <laugh> <iver>
oh realli <iver>
<vocnois> oh realli <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> oh i see <sil> well that'd be a good wai i would think <iver>
yeah yeah then <cutoff-the=there> <laugh-there'd_be_no> desir yeah <iver>
yeah that seem good <nois> <iver>
that's cool <vocnois> <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
<vocnois> yeah that's uh <sil> the the bureaucraci <sil> it'd be too much of a struggl i think <iver>
<vocnois> yeah but if you're the first state in the union to do it <vocnois> it <cutoff-co=cost> it'll cost you <ext-million> and million it would be rough it be so hard to <iver>
<nois> i know exactli <iver>
<vocnois> you would <vocnois-think> but <vocnois> i don't know there ha to be someth like <ext-why> you know the first state <cutoff-tha=that> <cutoff-do=doe> that doe it <vocnois> i mean <cutoff-aa=i> i after <cutoff-f=?> on i'm sure other would follow suit <vocnois> it after thei see the <vocnois-benefit> of it <vocnois> but <sil> that first on <sil> i don't <ext-know> <iver>
and it would take <cutoff-f=?> like year i would think to implement the program successfulli <sil> <iver>
<vocnois> govern doesn't seem to work too swiftli <vocnois> <iver>
<laugh-no_not_that> not that i've seen <sil> yknow <iver>
<ext-no> becaus <vocnois> honestli like <vocnois> gore to me is like a <vocnois-best> out of a bad bunch <laugh-like> <sil> if i have to choos i'll choos gore <vocnois> but that doesn't mean i necessarili like <vocnois> he's most in line with a lot of my <cutoff-stu=stuff> <sil> with a lot of my view <vocnois> <cutoff-no=now> don't get me wrong i'm not <vocnois> complet liber on everyth like there's <vocnois> certain thing i guess mayb <vocnois> becaus go to school in ashland it just rub off on you <laugh-there's_certain_thing_like> <vocnois> i'm not so liber about but <vocnois> i don't realli <sil> like gore just seem so dry and just not <vocnois> it's hard to <sil> i <vocnois-think> it'd be hard to get peopl enthusiast for him <iver>
no not at all i would've rather vote for <ext-mccain> <sil> <vocnois> over bush <vocnois> becaus <vocnois> bush <sil> <he-he> <sil> he come from a polit famili which i'm not sai is wrong becaus the kennedi were a big <sil> polit famili <vocnois> but i'm sai like bush is um <vocnois> he just seem like <sil> he didn't realli <sil> like <cutoff-ih=?> everyth's been hand to him in life <sil> <he-and> <vocnois> <he-uh> <vocnois> the issu of like whether he did drug not that that's a big issu but i don't like the wai he address it <vocnois> yknow that to me <vocnois> <vocnois-just> <vocnois> if you did drug okai everyon might experi or try or make a mistak <vocnois> but the wai he's handl it sai i'm not even gonna dignifi that question over and over and over <vocnois> if he didn't do it he might as well just be like no i didn't do it <iver>
yknow becaus then what doe he have to hide <vocnois> and then <vocnois> like the fact that he didn't know <sil> like i <vocnois-think> in intern polici he'll be struggl if he becom presid <vocnois> he didn't know the <vocnois> <vocnois-three> leader of the world <vocnois> thing and then on top of it like <vocnois> texa is a fairli big economi but still like <vocnois> to manag an entir yknow <sil> an entir economi <iver>
i <cutoff-th=think?> <iver>
yeah <sil> and that <sil> like <sil> i <vocnois-don't_know> <cutoff-tha=that> that state's notori for kill peopl i think thei kill someon last night <iver>
<ext-so> <vocnois> that to me is <laugh-veri> <vocnois> like <sil> that's ridicul like the governor he could've made a stai or yknow what i mean <vocnois> and thei've openli admit that thei've kill peopl <vocnois> that <sil> were found to be innoc later <iver>
yeah <vocnois> and it's like number on in the union and that's like <vocnois> such a disturb fact to me that you could take someon's life and be like <vocnois> oh our bad <vocnois> that person wa innoc <vocnois> yknow <iver>
<cutoff-tha=that> <iver>
definit <vocnois> i definit <vocnois> the wai i feel <sil> the death <vocnois-penalti's> wrong <vocnois> but <he-uh> <vocnois> i don't know <vocnois-peopl> ar alwai like oh you know if your mother <cutoff-ih=if> if your mother wa kill god forbid <vocnois> but like you would want the death penalti but <vocnois> honestli i don't think i would <vocnois> i realli like i'd feel angri toward that person but <vocnois> kill them doesn't <vocnois> help <ext-me> <sil> with <he-my> mayb the famili sai it help with closur and everyth but <vocnois> i <cutoff-eh=?> that to me <he-is> <vocnois> it's displac my anger in a wai that <sil> actual i don't think <vocnois> <he-the> <vocnois> my victim that i wa so close to me would want me to do <vocnois> yknow <sil> so <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> well like <vocnois> i'm a philosophi minor <he-so> <sil> like <vocnois> if you look at like differ <sil> ethic theori and stuff <he-like> <sil> <cutoff-yo=you> <sil> like there's a hierarchi kind of <vocnois> thi is what i've found <sil> there's a hierarchi of <vocnois> thing that ar <sil> uh <sil> like the inalien right for instanc <vocnois> like <vocnois> i can't <sil> if you come into my hous <vocnois> and rob me <sil> and then run outsid <sil> <ext-i'm> <nois-not_gonna> i <cutoff-don=don't> <vocnois> like <sil> to kill you for steal my properti <sil> like there's a hierarchi there <vocnois> uh for steal anoth life that's why peopl sai oh you can do it so <vocnois> but i realli feel like <vocnois> there's noth <vocnois> like <sil> if i if it's inalien the definit is <vocnois> it's not <sil> abl to be taken not even by yourself that's why you can't commit suicid <vocnois> and sinc it's the highest thing becaus without it you can't even do the other <vocnois> it's so it natur ha to be higher order than the other becaus <vocnois> without that you can't do the <vocnois> you can't be <sil> ethic in ani other <ext-wai> <vocnois> so <sil> that ha to be the highest thing <sil> and if it's <sil> inalien becaus <sil> i didn't give it to you <sil> i can't take it back <vocnois> you never <sil> forfeit that <sil> you never gave me that right <vocnois> <ext-so> <vocnois> that's why i feel like <vocnois> i could <ext-never> <sil> want that in <cutoff-a=?> <sil> to kill anoth person or <cutoff-an=anyth> <iver>
well yeah <cutoff-uh=under> <sil> under certain <cutoff-c=circumst> <iver>
yeah well <cutoff-it=it's> <iver>
<vocnois> uh we took <he-um> <sil> uh i took <he-uh> <sil> militari ethic <vocnois> as a philosophi cours <vocnois> and that wa realli interest becaus even though in <sil> even in that hierarchi <vocnois> there's still certain context within the context of war for instanc <vocnois> if <sil> if we both <ext-know> if we knowingli go into it as combat <sil> and <cutoff-we'r=we're> <sil> we're fight for <sil> whatev caus but if we both <vocnois> ar willingli go into it 
<vocnois> and we know that the result could be death <vocnois> then <vocnois> like <vocnois> and it <vocnois> and it's <vocnois> an <error-agressin=agress> <sil> an aggress thing on side will be the aggressor on would <vocnois> obvious <vocnois> becaus you can't have two <vocnois> uh <vocnois> two aggress thing <vocnois> uh uh <vocnois> natur on would be aggress <sil> and then on would <vocnois> be aggress in it's respons <vocnois> you can't you know what i mean <vocnois> so in like a state of war <sil> it wa like that so <vocnois> <cutoff-m=?> <vocnois> in that context i think <vocnois> but like <sil> in the same context <vocnois> i feel it'd be wrong for a soldier to kill a civilian becaus <vocnois> thei didn't <vocnois> um thei didn't decid to becom a combat <vocnois> so if you're an <vocnois> if you're a combat and you make that decis <vocnois> or your draft which <vocnois> that <vocnois> that is kind of like make the decis in the sens that you ar part of that societi that got you draft <vocnois> so if you choos to be part of that societi <vocnois> that <vocnois> i mean that's a littl shadier if <vocnois> but still if you're <vocnois> if you both make the <vocnois> the desir to do it then <vocnois> so <vocnois> like if i were draft i think i would fight i'm sure i would fight for the countri or <vocnois> you know <vocnois> but <vocnois> i don't think i would go <sil> <ext-like> you know <vocnois> i just don't feel the need to go <vocnois> on a <laugh-rampag_or_anyth> <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
well i mean <vocnois> to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if <vocnois> you're guilti or innoc <vocnois> there to me there's <error-worth=wors> <cutoff-thi=thing> wors thing <vocnois> i would think than <vocnois> than dy you know <vocnois> <cutoff-y=you> you <vocnois> like i know in israel the gui who kill yitzhak rabin <vocnois> he got lock up <sil> and he's not allow to see <cutoff-e=?> <sil> uh becaus uh <sil> um <vocnois> under jewish law <vocnois> you can't kill <iver>
for that for <vocnois> for that so <vocnois> he he got lock up and he's not allow to see anoth human be <iver>
like thei have thi thei have like <vocnois> <unknown> two door and like thei put hi food there and then thei close on door and then he open <vocnois> and like <vocnois> could you imagin <cutoff-f=?> <vocnois> like <iver>
no sunlight <vocnois> you know <sil> the and <cutoff-i=it> thei don't give him thei keep it warm <vocnois> and he's not allow sheet or razor <vocnois> or <vocnois> you know other than electr razor so he can't kill himself <vocnois> so you're just stuck <cutoff-y=you> there's noth you could do all dai for forti year or howev until he natur di <vocnois> and that to me would be <vocnois> like that to me is actual like <vocnois> that ha to be wors <vocnois> <nois-like> <vocnois> just the agoni and the <vocnois> and the i think you'd have to go insan like there's onli so much you <vocnois-can> <vocnois> i'd ask for board game or someth but like he <cutoff-ca=can't> <vocnois> doesn't even hear a human voic <vocnois> becaus <cutoff-wah=?> <vocnois> i think it's someth like that wa written in the scriptur like <vocnois> you're dead to the world for <sil> uh <cutoff-i=is> <sil> is the wors that you can do and so <vocnois> the world <vocnois> see him <sil> you know what i mean <vocnois> so that'd be <ext-rough> <sil> that'd be real rough and <vocnois> so obvious he would want to um <vocnois> i would like thei sai like now like peopl that observ him he's like sing to himself and he <vocnois> read the bibl like <sil> everydai <vocnois-and> <vocnois> but like i don't know that'd be <ext-strang> <vocnois> be such a horribl thing to go through i couldn't imagin be lock in a room for <vocnois-like> <vocnois> few dai <iver>
like that <sil> like solitari <vocnois> but like unlimit solitari that <vocnois-doesn't> seem right either but <iver>
yeah like it's just <unknown> it's kill it's own citizen it's so <vocnois-ridicul> <iver>
yeah <iver>
yeah exactli <iver>
if you just look at the natur of what thei're do it's just <iver>
inher wrong to me <iver>
yeah exactli that'll <laugh-solv_the-problem> <iver>
that's just it's ridicul <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
you can get in huge argument peopl like no you're ly becaus if your mother di or someon close to you di you would want them dead <vocnois> and honestli <vocnois> i can honestli sai i would not want that to happen to them <iver>
you know <iver>
peopl can't <cutoff-understa=understand> <iver>
thei can't fathom that <iver>
exactli <iver>
<laugh> <vocnois> thei cannot understand where you're come from <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
yeah not not for special condit <laugh-noth> just univers it's wrong <iver>
yeah that's what it is <vocnois> it's a market thing <iver>
mayb at the <vocnois> under ly base <iver>
<laugh> exactli <laugh> <iver>
that's ridicul it's like barbar to me like <vocnois> ugh <iver>
yeah and we're <laugh-on_of_them> <laugh> texa is support strong thei have like <iver>
i forget thei have the <vocnois> like wai more than like thei dwarf ani other state i think so <vocnois> that to me is not <sil> that's not admir and then i <cutoff-wou=would> <cutoff-a=i> <vocnois> so the <vocnois> <vocnois-that's> on reason i wouldn't vote for bush <iver>
<laugh> plu i don't realli feel like the <vocnois-republican_parti_repres> <vocnois> the <vocnois-populac> at a whole like at their <laugh-last> polit convent like <vocnois> in uh <vocnois> the last presidenti elect in nineti six <vocnois> thei said on in ten of the deleg that were <sil> attend the convent were millionair <vocnois> now grant i know more than ten peopl and not <cutoff-w=on> <vocnois> you know what i <nois-mean> <nois> <nois-so_to_me_i> <nois> just feel <vocnois-like> <nois> that's not a good represent <iver>
yeah <vocnois> yeah <iver>
thei <vocnois> thei definit struggl <sil> it <sil> thei do some <vocnois> i i think <vocnois> to be that high up <vocnois> obvious <vocnois> you're gonna come in contact with power <vocnois-peopl_rich> peopl and <vocnois> thing like that but <vocnois> i think at least even if the democrat <vocnois> do have that same <vocnois> thing thei seem to keep more in mind <vocnois-the> <vocnois> i don't know i don't think thei repres <vocnois> work class <vocnois> you know <vocnois> gui either but <vocnois> at least more so than the <vocnois-republican> <vocnois> so like i said best out of a bad bunch i'd probabl <iver>
yeah <vocnois> <laugh-i_think> so <vocnois> i think so <vocnois> and like <vocnois> thei just <cutoff-d=don't?> neither of the candid realli seem like thei have that much integr <vocnois> me you know <vocnois> so <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
i have no idea i rememb where i wa too when the columbin shoot becaus like <vocnois> my friend and i we're sit around drink a few <vocnois-beer> and <vocnois> you know we're channel surf <vocnois> and you know we see that kid fall out of the window and we're like oh my god what is go on so <sil> we just left it on and <vocnois> it wa quit <vocnois> <cutoff-eyz=?> like it wa disturb becaus <sil> i <unknown> <vocnois> like i wa recent out of high school myself and like sure there were fight and stuff <laugh-but_it_wa_alwai> like you could avoid them or <vocnois> know what i mean <iver>
<vocnois> but now it seem like peopl ar just <vocnois> like <vocnois> i don't know why that's a trend i mean <vocnois> my dad said <vocnois> uh he grew up in the bronx <iver>
and <vocnois> he said even in the when he wa in high school that thei had <sil> thei had polic offic there so that's not like a new thing <vocnois> but he said <vocnois> you'd have peopl with like knive and you'd have peopl with fist fight but you <sil> like gun wa unheard of <sil> you know and i think <vocnois> i don't know where thi new trend is come from i think mayb uh <vocnois> thei're <vocnois> peopl feel deject <vocnois> in high school i'm sure of it <vocnois> you know <vocnois> like <vocnois> i don't i <cutoff-wa=wasn't> i didn't feel that wai <sil> but <vocnois> i'd like <vocnois> in retrospect i look back and i thought <sil> you know i'm think mayb those peopl realli felt like horribl and like <vocnois> if everi dai wa like <ext-so> traumat to them <vocnois> like that'd be so like for four year everi dai you're just like <ext-teas> or <sil> someth like horribl and you <vocnois> like no on talk to you <vocnois> i'm not <vocnois> justifi what thei do at all <vocnois> but i'm sai <vocnois> that would make them more <sil> that would probabl in their mind give them the reason <iver>
to sai you know what i'm sick of thi i'm gonna shoot those <vocnois-peopl> <vocnois> but <vocnois> i <iver>
yeah i mean get a gun doesn't <cutoff-se=seem> i mean i wa surpris like <vocnois> <cutoff-a=i> <vocnois> i would i've never own a gun <vocnois> but <sil> <vocnois-i'm> <vocnois> i think it's pretti easi to get on <laugh-actual> <iver>
yeah so <vocnois> yeah and a lot peopl turn eighteen when thei're in high school so <vocnois> <vocnois-i'm> sure thei can <vocnois> go get on there <iver>
<laugh> <vocnois> that's just ridicul too <laugh-though> <vocnois> but <vocnois> yeah that's to me that's realli weird <vocnois> i don't like i said i don't know what thei're <cutoff-thi=think> <sil> <cutoff-th=the> what thei're think <vocnois> it <vocnois-or_what> their thought process wa but <vocnois> i'm think mayb <vocnois> it the social becaus a lot <vocnois> to me a high school is real social <iver>
and like the social aspect of it were <vocnois-the> problem <nois> so <iver>
like i know uh like i wa a <vocnois> four year member of student council and like did that <cutoff-di=did> went that rout in high school <vocnois> and i know we alwai tri to involv other peopl <vocnois> but like thei would look at us and be like that's so lame i would never do it <iver>
so like <vocnois> it's like <vocnois> you had these war like <vocnois> two differ camp the <vocnois> you know the camp that get enthusiast and <vocnois> and that's where i wa and then there's the other camp and i'm sure thei have <vocnois> their own <sil> hierarchi their whole structur and like <vocnois> you know thei do thing their wai <vocnois> <iver>
while <cutoff-sai=sai> while pooh-pooh everyth and sai thi is dumb and stuff <vocnois> <vocnois-as> <vocnois> as far as bring the two togeth like <vocnois> social <sil> i think that's just a rough ag <iver>
you know becaus <cutoff-yi=you> <vocnois> you're learn more about yourself <vocnois> and uh <sil> you're <cutoff-al=also> you're also learn more about <vocnois> like you're <vocnois-experienc> a lot of freedom that you didn't have obvious <sil> you know <vocnois> you're drive <vocnois> 
<vocnois> you have to go to danc you have to do that whole thing so <vocnois> i realli don't know how to how <sil> how thei would go about do that perhap <vocnois> like i know we us to have like uh <vocnois> we had <sil> like the administr actual allow us to have <vocnois> ah <sil> a dai where <vocnois> everyon like the whole class <vocnois> as <vocnois-a> class could go have a picnic <vocnois> like in the practic footbal field and that wa cool becaus <vocnois> everyon got along those dai <vocnois-becaus> you didn't have to go to class you know you spent the second half the dai <vocnois-just> <vocnois> hang out and so everyon got along that wai and i think that would be a start <sil> you know <vocnois> but then <vocnois> that hurt <vocnois> the <cutoff-f=?> <vocnois> the <cutoff-a=administr> <sil> the administr in a sens that <sil> thei're there to provid an <error-edic=educ> <sil> educ <vocnois> so <vocnois> it'd be rough <vocnois> in like my high school <sil> thei <sil> thei put up <ext-camera> <vocnois-and_thei_had_like> <vocnois> thei lock <ext-bathroom> <vocnois-like> at certain time you couldn't go in them and <vocnois> like it wa get <sil> and thei had like we were on the front page the akron beacon journal <vocnois> becaus thei had a lock down where <vocnois> no on wa allow to leav their classroom <vocnois> and then <vocnois> thei brought thi <vocnois> the dog <ext-through> <vocnois-and> <vocnois> thei found <sil> i wa surpris thei found a lot of drug <iver>
and <sil> i wasn't real <vocnois> i wa more surpris that thei found a lot of <cutoff-l=like> <vocnois> <vocnois-like> <sil> alcohol like i wouldn't <vocnois> like <vocnois> you know like some peopl <vocnois> if thei do drug at school and stuff <vocnois> i'm not sai that's right but <vocnois> thei'll <vocnois> thei'll do it but like <sil> alcohol it'd be so hard to like hide becaus it <laugh-smell> you know and you <laugh-gotta> hold it out but thei found like bottl of <ext-liquor> and <vocnois> <iver>
stuff like that and i think thei even might have found like on or two <vocnois-gun> <vocnois> so <vocnois> and that to me wa <vocnois> <sil> but my high school is two thousand peopl so i guess <vocnois> by sheer number <vocnois> on or two person would bring a gun <iver>
um <sil> it's consid <vocnois> urban <vocnois> but becaus it's north of akron we plai <vocnois-like> <vocnois> a lot of like <vocnois> the <sil> inner citi like in akron school <vocnois> but in my opinion it's suburbia <vocnois> like <vocnois> but we have the we have the big citi problem like <vocnois> there's a lot <unknown> drug <sil> and <cutoff-i=it> i think that's just becaus <vocnois> the build's old so no on realli take pride <vocnois-in> it <vocnois> and then <sil> it's two <vocnois-thousand> peopl <iver>
so that <vocnois> like the just the sheer number of it i think <iver>
i <cutoff-thi=think> i <he-would> like if you had to ask i'd sai i wa a straight <cutoff-m=mid> mid western suburbanit <sil> but <vocnois> there ar peopl that i go to school with <vocnois> and ashland is twenti five thousand <vocnois> like <sil> in the citi <iver>
and thei <vocnois> thei sai that's a citi <sil> and <vocnois> my school <vocnois> or <cutoff-m=my> <vocnois> where i grew up wa <vocnois> more than doubl that <sil> just over doubl that it wa like sixti thousand <iver>
and <iver>
cuyahoga fall <iver>
and to me that's consid suburbia <vocnois> so <vocnois> and to me ashland is consid the stick i mean <vocnois> there's <cutoff-peop=peopl> there's amish buggi that go by <iver>
but like to some peopl that's consid a citi so i think it's you're perspect <vocnois-in_that> sens <iver>
for fun <vocnois> we've been plai a lot of pool <iver>
a <laugh-lot_of> pool <sil> actual <vocnois> uh we go to a bar <vocnois> call the out-r-inn <sil> becaus it's cheap and <sil> it's fun there <iver>

<laugh> <iver>
especi the gui <laugh-yeah> <vocnois> <iver>
just <iver>
yeah we had um <sil> ani <sil> not realli just <sil> modest dress you couldn't wear pant <vocnois> and it <cutoff-wou=would> <vocnois> dress couldn't be ankl length <vocnois> thei couldn't be <sil> um at the knee <sil> had to be mid <cutoff-ca=calf> mid <cutoff-kn=knee> <sil> mid <sil> knee <sil> or whatev that is calf <sil> <laugh> <vocnois> and that wa <vocnois> <sil> certain restrict but yeah i mean basic just modest <nois> whatev <sil> i mean i wear <sil> boot with a dress in <laugh-russia_but> <iver>
i don't think you'd do that here <laugh> <iver>
i think so yeah like their haircut ar a certain wai and <vocnois> can't <sil> you have to shave and <vocnois> um you alwai have to have your tie <sil> and <sil> your jacket if you can <sil> unless it's realli hot <sil> there's <cutoff-di=differ> it's differ <sil> also depend on the climat <iver>
some place you're allow to wear sandal <sil> and <iver>
right <iver>
yeah <vocnois> <laugh-no> <laugh> <iver>
right <vocnois> <iver>
just <cutoff-t=to> <sil> i think it's uh <nois> a <cutoff-r=reflect> to reflect <vocnois> the <sil> the <sil> uh um <sil> belief <sil> that <sil> we're try to <cutoff-sh=show> carri and <vocnois> and <vocnois> <sil> becaus <vocnois> i think if someon show up and look like <sil> i mean i'm not sai that it's terribl it but if thei had like a nose ring and all thi stuff <vocnois> then <sil> it <sil> <vocnois> somebodi might <sil> <he-not> <sil> believ that thei have anyth credibl to sai <vocnois> and <sil> a lot of time if you're dress <sil> more respectfulli that to <vocnois> yknow <sil> i mean most the peopl will accept you <vocnois> if you're dress <vocnois> in a dress <vocnois> wherea <sil> i mean even a person in a nose ring will <cutoff-ta=talk> <vocnois> will respect you but <vocnois> but then you're in a <vocnois> you're at a <cutoff-l=loss> disadvantag if you don't <laugh> dress in a certain wai <iver>
yeah <iver>
right thei look at <sil> more what you have to sai then <sil> your cloth and that that wa <cutoff-a> <sil> someth i rememb them talk about too <vocnois> you don't want them to look at what you're <unknown> <sil> what you're wear <vocnois> and <sil> that's mostli <vocnois> that wa a good <sil> thing for the dress code just <vocnois> <iver>
well not realli thei uh have a lot of <vocnois> um <sil> religi belief <sil> on their own that thei've had held on to becaus <vocnois> um thei have just have had noth <iver>
<unknown> thei weren't even allow to <cutoff-ha=have> believ in god <iver>
right <vocnois> so a lot of them alreadi believ and that <sil> thei have their own religion <vocnois> and thei <vocnois> thei're realli faith <vocnois> so that wa the <cutoff-m=main> on of the main problem is that thei <sil> um <sil> thei had been so <sil> hold on to that for so <vocnois> long and it's so strong <vocnois> thei don't wanna <sil> let go of <vocnois> what and then the men <sil> their problem wa usual that thei would drink a lot <sil> and <iver>
so <vocnois> the it <vocnois> <sil> it wa hard to talk to drunk peopl <laugh> <iver>
um-hum <iver>
yeah thei're russian orthodox <sil> same <sil> basic same thing <vocnois> <iver>
yeah i don't even know what their <sil> holidai ar <vocnois> i <sil> i don't know <sil> <iver>
um-hum <iver>
like <cutoff-cathol=cathol> <sil> <vocnois-cathol=catholic> <sil> oh from mormon <vocnois> well <sil> our basic <vocnois> um <sil> real fundament belief is that <sil> the church that the <sil> russian believ in at on time wa <sil> the true church and that it wa <vocnois> um <sil> the <sil> the same church that christ set up <sil> when he wa on the earth <vocnois> with the twelv apostl and <vocnois> and but the <sil> <vocnois> after christ di that <vocnois> the <sil> author <vocnois> wa taken from the earth <vocnois> to <sil> um have those <sil> apostl and to <sil> have the <sil> the church set up like it wa <vocnois> and <sil> it <cutoff-w=wa> <sil> must have been realli strong becaus it's still last all the same cathol and <cutoff-ortho=orthodox> all the orthodox church still carri <unknown> all these belief <vocnois> 
<sil> but <sil> <vocnois> our belief is that <vocnois> it didn't <sil> it <vocnois> <sil> it need to be restor <vocnois> <cutoff-an=and> <vocnois> and we believ i don't know if you've heard about joseph smith <vocnois> or <iver>
<vocnois> well we believ that <sil> um <sil> that revel <vocnois> that wa there on earth <vocnois> wa <vocnois> actual restor <vocnois> again and <vocnois> through joseph smith becaus he <vocnois> had <sil> a desir in hi heart to know what wa true and he prai <vocnois> and he actual had a vision where he saw <sil> god and <vocnois> jesu christ <vocnois> and i know thi is all realli <sil> i mean thi is like deep doctrin stuff but <vocnois> and um <vocnois> and he wa told that there were <cutoff-nah=none> <vocnois> none of the church on the <sil> earth were true <vocnois> that <sil> <vocnois> some of them had good thing but thei <sil> their um <vocnois> thei weren't exactli hit the mark <iver>
and <sil> that <sil> <cutoff-i=it> <vocnois> it wa gonna about to be restor again <vocnois> and so we believ that the true church is actual restor again to the earth <iver>
and it wa through joseph smith and he translat <vocnois> the book of mormon <sil> with <vocnois> help from god <vocnois> and so that's basic it <vocnois> i mean the book of mormon is <sil> a counterpart to the bibl <sil> it's a <vocnois> it's <sil> from <vocnois> prophet that live in america <vocnois> <iver>
so you knew you've heard about that probabl <iver>
oh okai <iver>
<unknown> <iver>
it's easi <sil> to <cutoff-for=forget> <laugh> <iver>
um-hum <vocnois> it <cutoff-i=is> it's <sil> it's american in the <vocnois> from the fact that it's <vocnois> um <vocnois> it wa written by <vocnois> nativ american <sil> and <sil> and um <sil> <unknown> <sil> and joseph smith wa an american <vocnois> and he wa <sil> us to <vocnois> to translat it so it is <vocnois> and it it's actual funni though but <error-there'st=there's> <sil> more member of the church that live outsid of america <iver>
it's <vocnois> gotten to the point where there's <sil> there's <sil> more than five million outsid <iver>
less in america then <cutoff-the=there> <laugh> <iver>
that's exactli what it <laugh-i=is> <laugh> <iver>
<vocnois> yeah <iver>
oh <unknown> there wa a lot of discourag thing <sil> just <vocnois> i mean <vocnois> i learn so much <sil> <vocnois> it <cutoff-w=wasn't> and it wasn't alwai just peopl reject you that wa discourag becaus that wa kind of funni at time <iver>
peopl would <sil> <error-you'n=you'd> <error-dock=knock> on the door and thei would <error-yeyal=yell> <vocnois> yell that thei weren't home or someth and <iver>
and so <vocnois> it wa kind of funni but <sil> but the <vocnois> discourag i mean it wa discourag when you see peopl that don't have ani <vocnois> hope and <iver>
thei get so <sil> <cutoff-s=?> <vocnois> thei're just so poor and thei <vocnois> and <sil> and you <cutoff-f=feel> i <cutoff-f=felt> <sil> <cutoff-we=well> <vocnois> we felt sometim like <vocnois> we could help them but <sil> thei didn't want ani <vocnois> help and <vocnois> it wa kind of hard to <sil> just <sil> sai okai well <vocnois> i did what i could and <iver>
i mean <vocnois> not sai that thei had to believ what we believ but just <vocnois> even just <sil> the their attitud about life wa so <vocnois> down and <iver>
yeah <vocnois> thei were just so <vocnois> <iver>
there wa other thing <vocnois> right yeah <vocnois> like we had our servic we'd clean up <sil> neighborhood or <vocnois> yeah there wa a lot of differ thing <iver>
um-hum <iver>
no i think thei like that <sil> it <cutoff-wa=wa> it wa realli funni becaus here if you went into a <vocnois> a <vocnois> school or someth and said <vocnois> we wanna <vocnois> help <sil> we wanna teach a class <vocnois> or <iver>
we wanna clean or anyth <vocnois> thei would probabl sai <sil> yknow thei might think it wa kind of weird but thei <vocnois> would <vocnois> let you <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> but thei would be like you wanna do thi and we don't have ani monei to pai you <sil> oh but we don't <vocnois> yknow we don't want monei that's the whole point we're <cutoff-s=serv> <iver>
we want to serv you <vocnois> mm thei <cutoff-v=?> thei didn't get that at all <laugh> <vocnois> thei were like <vocnois> <laugh> some peopl would just be like no no wai it doesn't make sens <laugh> <iver>
probabl a littl bit <iver>
um-hum <iver>
there is yeah <iver>
it'd be a lot more accept i think here <vocnois> even though it might be kind of <vocnois> i wouldn't do that um <sil> on my own but <vocnois> if i'm <vocnois> i felt like <vocnois> that wa what i wa do all the time so <laugh> <vocnois> full time <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
oh <vocnois> <laugh-yeah> <laugh> <iver>
i think <sil> the <vocnois> on of the thing that we <sil> when when you're baptiz is that <vocnois> <sil> you're realli <vocnois> suppos to <vocnois> help other peopl to <vocnois> <cutoff-na=?> <vocnois> like if <vocnois> if <cutoff-yi=you> somebodi give you a gift you wanna give it to someon els <vocnois> but it's <sil> easi a lot of time just to fall into the <vocnois> yknow like <vocnois> mold of <vocnois> not let anyon know what you believ and <vocnois> just <sil> so that thei <vocnois> think well what ar those weirdo yknow thei don't wear makeup or whatev but we <cutoff-we=wear> <sil> we can wear makeup if we want <laugh> <vocnois> but <sil> so <vocnois> i think <vocnois> <unknown> a lot of time peopl do fall in <vocnois> to sort of <vocnois> but i <vocnois> i wa not rais <sil> mormon so <vocnois> i have a lot of <sil> my famili and friend who ar still not member of the church <vocnois> and <sil> also becaus it's so new to me that <vocnois> i <vocnois> am just <sil> yknow i will talk about it with anybodi and <vocnois> and <vocnois> and so <vocnois> and i'm also <sil> not afraid of peopl who aren't mormon becaus i think if you grow up like <vocnois> a member of the church and <vocnois> you might be <cutoff-af=afraid> <vocnois> more afraid of peopl <vocnois> that don't <sil> believ like you've been taught <vocnois> i think <sil> a lot of the <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> we don't <vocnois> drink alcohol we don't <sil> there's a lot of restrict <vocnois> i guess you call them restrict but thei're <vocnois> <cutoff-el=health> <vocnois> i feel like thei're more <vocnois> just health code <vocnois> just keep you healthi and <vocnois> so <vocnois> um <sil> it might be <vocnois> it's like if we <cutoff-wu=?> <sil> <ext-if> <vocnois> america <vocnois> yknow we're <vocnois> we're us to be rais on wai if we went to anoth countri just kind of like <vocnois> you might wanna get to know the chines peopl but <vocnois> you might not quit <vocnois> be a littl timid about <sil> yknow <error-stame=same> kind of thing <sil> but <vocnois> i <vocnois> i'm not i don't have ani of those barrier <iver>
sinc i've been <vocnois> on both <vocnois> world <laugh> <iver>

<ext-game> <sil> i don't know <ext-we> we vari it from on week to the next <iver>
um <vocnois> <sil> <nois-either> <sil> role plai game <iver>
under whatev system <nois-is> popular that <sil> dai <vocnois> <sil> <ext-um> <sil> <ext-or> card game <sil> <iver>
<sil> <vocnois> not usual fifti two card deck card but <sil> other interest type of card <iver>
or board game <sil> or <sil> <vocnois> just <sil> <vocnois> anyth that happen to appeal <sil> <iver>
is a <iver>
group of five gui who know each other <sil> <iver>
<sil> <iver>
<sil> <ext-mm> <sil> no <sil> some of them plai at game store <nois-but> i <sil> done it onc and said eh <sil> it wasn't that good <vocnois> <iver>
and continu merrili on with <sil> my dai <sil> <vocnois> <iver>
<sil> <vocnois> there you go <iver>
i had enough <sil> friend who said to me <vocnois> can you make monei with comput <sil> <nois-and> i said <sil> ye you can make <error-onei=monei> with comput <sil> and i said <vocnois> <sil> what <sil> could i <onei=monei> with comput <sil> <iver>
then i final just said <vocnois> <sil> okai <sil> <laugh> train peopl to make <sil> monei with comput <vocnois> so <sil> <iver>
none of these <nois-peopl> <vocnois> would <sil> well <sil> no <sil> some of these peopl would know what ebai is but probabl onli on or two out of like six <sil> <iver>
<sil> so <vocnois> <sil> what we're talk an extraordinarili low level understand of what comput ar how thei work so <vocnois> class on wa demystifi the comput <sil> we took it apart <vocnois> we label everyth insid i gave them all a piec i said put it back togeth <vocnois> <sil> we turn it on we saw if it <sil> work <sil> we went back in figur out why it didn't work <sil> took it apart again <vocnois> thi wasn't someth can do hardwar becaus hardwar <vocnois> <sil> ha <sil> no monei in it <sil> but <vocnois> <sil> um it wa so that thei're not scare of the magic box <iver>
and by the end of the first week or two thei were no longer scare of the magic box and could continu to oper system <ext-word> <ext-um> <sil> the goal of learn oper system is real simpl <sil> <vocnois> if you're plai with comput <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and you screw someth up <sil> <vocnois> <sil> the worst thing you can possibl do <sil> is screw it up so badli that you have to start over <sil> <iver>
start over mean <sil> put a new oper system on it <iver>
<sil> <sil> anyth els <sil> is a hardwar failur and you have to go <sil> fix it <sil> somewher els anywai <vocnois> so <sil> if you know how to put an oper system on your machin <sil> you can start over <vocnois> <sil> if you can start over there's no reason to be scare of anyth that you do <sil> problem number on in plai with comput for most peopl is be afraid that thei're go to break someth <sil> <iver>
so onc you convinc peopl that there's noth <error-ne=to> be scare of here and there's noth to be scare of there <vocnois> i mean and then thei start to plai <vocnois> <nois> and onc you start plai you start learn <sil> <iver>
if you can't plai <sil> you won't learn you just sit there and follow my direct and that's dumb <sil> <iver>
<vocnois> most of them ar still sadli just sit there and follow my direct but thei're get better <iver>

i mean there'll be <unknown> there seem to me there more on liner <vocnois> so i'm a littl disappoint i'm sad that the show's go off <sil> the <cutoff-th=the> the show's gonna stop but i'm not as <vocnois> sad becaus the product i'm get now it <sil> with the simpson <vocnois> have it be replac by futurama which <sil> ah i find to be <sil> absolut geniu <vocnois> <unknown> so it's not so bad it <sil> x-file <vocnois> i'm sad but not as sad base on the past coupl season when deep space nine went off the <sil> the air that on realli bother me <vocnois> and <vocnois> thei even had a star trek replac <iver>
still on but uh <vocnois> i don't know <iver>
um <iver>
kinda yknow we know but it's <iver>
<vocnois> <cutoff-th=the> <sil> what i've <sil> like so much about it is thei tell you everyth and then <sil> you find out that it's not right <vocnois> and that it's wrong i mean <sil> there wa the episod 
<sil> uh the two parter <sil> uh last season where it wa <sil> the advertis full disclosur <iver>
and <iver>
what <sil> and the first episod the first half wa <sil> excel had the cigarett smoke man just <sil> it wa from hi perspect <vocnois> he wa talk that then the second half got like <iver>
oh no <vocnois> and it turn out it wa the <vocnois> <sil> the uh the faceless alien set a trap for the <vocnois> for the gui and <sil> i didn't like the wai it wa resolv but i like the fact that it wasn't <sil> resolv the wai that thei set it up <vocnois> so i think that <sil> i mean <cutoff-w=we> <sil> we supposedli know about samantha <vocnois> <iver>
but <vocnois> <cutoff-f=?> <sil> she's out there somewher <vocnois> yknow we don't <sil> have <sil> again we don't have clear evid <vocnois> where she is and there were coupl time where thei <sil> where we thought we knew where samantha wa <vocnois> <sil> uh <vocnois> and when there were all those clone of her <vocnois> <sil> uh i think that wa in the second season or so <vocnois> um <sil> <vocnois> <sil> i think if <cutoff-th=the> <vocnois> if thei were gonna end it thei were gonna have to have like three episod in a row that just were tie up all these loos end that thei keep have <vocnois> i suspect thei probabl won't do that <vocnois> <sil> thei'll <sil> um <vocnois> leav thing open end for <sil> futur tv movi or mayb anoth <sil> uh <vocnois> featur length movi <sil> uh <iver>
yeah <vocnois> and thei're also talk about <sil> caus <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> uh <sil> the actor <sil> the the reason thei're <sil> end it <sil> is becaus the actor don't wanna do it there wa talk i don't know if there still pursu thi <sil> that <vocnois> thei'd have new <sil> charact <sil> take over the role and <sil> i mean <vocnois> <sil> the charact develop is the most import part i think <vocnois> <sil> um <sil> so i think that'll be a failur but that also <sil> sorta <sil> tell me that thei're gonna leav thing kinda open <vocnois> <iver>
right <iver>
<vocnois> <cutoff-i=it> <iver>
thei thei could've taken <sil> <ext-other> <vocnois> i mean well thei kill all these peopl off but <cutoff-i=?> thei <sil> could've <sil> you'll put them into the background <sil> you have them do a coupl of show a season <vocnois> and then had <vocnois> yknow i don't know the adventur of <sil> uh <vocnois> oh <cutoff-s=spender> <sil> agent spender and <cutoff-w=what> <sil> the hell what's <vocnois> what's her name <vocnois> but then thei thei kill off <sil> <vocnois> <sil> all those like <sil> support <sil> former x-file associ peopl <iver>
so thei thei couldn't go in that direct thei'd have to just bring in new peopl which uh <vocnois> i think it <sil> probabl wouldn't be a good idea <vocnois> <iver>

oh yeah <sil> i've been do it i've been there twenti over twenti year so <sil> yeah i'm enjoi it <vocnois> it's alwai chang <iver>
oh <vocnois> the technolog is chang i mean the web is realli revolution what we're do <sil> uh <vocnois> well it's <sil> anybodi can connect to the web <iver>
uh befor we us to have a <nois-system> that onli peopl in the back <sil> room of the librari connect <ext-to> and it wa <vocnois> all mainfram and then peopl got p c's <vocnois> on their desk and suddenli the whole world of <vocnois> who could access <vocnois> ani system and what thei could do on their desk <vocnois> chang <vocnois> uh and now we've gone more out in the public work in the public scene do it's not just for the peopl in the back room <vocnois> uh <vocnois> and then the web yknow peopl anybodi anywher can connect we onli work with librari befor now we're try to figur out <vocnois> how do we deal with anybodi who just can want to connect to us <vocnois> <iver>
most of them that ar our site now we have more of a distribut system where we can actual go out and connect to other <vocnois> peopl <vocnois> connect to us and then go out as a gatewai to other place <sil> yeah <vocnois> we're <vocnois> get more into that now <vocnois> but that wasn't easi <sil> so easi befor either the <sil> yknow the web again <iver>
then that ha chang it <iver>

yeah it can be a problem uh if you get hit <iver>
know like if our system would shut down it would cost us <vocnois> i don't rememb what it is yknow ten of thousand of dollar for everi hour <sil> that we're down <vocnois> <he-uh> <sil> if our data base would be trash <sil> our main <nois-data> base would be trash we'd have real seriou problem and it could take week <vocnois> or <sil> month to rebuild it <sil> uh yeah so it could be a problem <vocnois> uh we've got peopl work in that area <iver>

uh pretti interest <vocnois> everybodi talk and frequent nobodi's listen <laugh-it's> it's <nois-and> yeah it's it's pretti interest um <vocnois> talk about how thei don't have the monei for thi and thei don't have the monei for that and then somebodi come up with <sil> well let's spend the monei over on someth els and nobodi act on it then thei go on to someth els <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
oh yeah <iver>
well uh it's like the <unknown> <iver>
well you <cutoff-ha=how> how long have you been here <iver>
uh okai <vocnois> well there <nois> few year ago there wa thi big fuss so ya know <nois-we've> got to close some school <unknown> <sil> ya know <nois-enrol's> drop it's <sil> ya know <nois> it's the wai <nois> popul goe <vocnois> enrol's drop we can't afford to keep them all go so let's close and thei did thi big studi and thei <sil> target some to close <vocnois> well there wa a big uproar from the peopl <sil> who's kid went to that school <sil> like there will be whenev you close a school so the board back down and chang it's mind <sil> the next year thei came out with a studi sai thei need more school <sil> but there wasn't the monei for it so there wa a big fuss about that then <sil> two year later thei came out with anoth studi <vocnois> it sai well thei need to refurbish or not <vocnois> some school close a coupl then knock some down and rebuild em <sil> and it's like everi two year it's a differ direct and it's like thei're almost afraid to take a stand that somebodi's not gonna like <sil> well if you're gonna shut a school down somebodi's gonna be realli tick off <iver>
<vocnois> right <iver>
i my <cutoff-s=unknown> my kid went to a school that <vocnois> well my son had alreadi left it but in <sil> the fourth grade thei announc <sil> took all the kid in the auditorium and said <sil> we're close next year <sil> and it wa hard but <sil> yeah onc it's reach the point that's decis is made and announc and <sil> i mean there <nois-were> good reason for it <sil> um <sil> and thei explain the reason and <sil> ya know <sil> at some point <vocnois> you have to figur out how much do you wanna fight someth <sil> when it's inevit <iver>
<vocnois> well that's the problem i think 
<sil> school board thei're alwai stop someth and thei don't seem to move forward veri well <sil> <vocnois> <iver>
<sil> i don't <sil> <vocnois> <sil> i don't know if that's what percol it <vocnois> it's veri differ in the public school the cathol school the public school <sil> you have all the problem of societi school you have the drug you have the absente <ext-parent> you have the delinqu <sil> in the cathol school thei just <sil> you don't have that for on thing <vocnois> <sil> uh ya know it's orient around the church even though we're not cathol <sil> <vocnois> it's still orient as so there's lot of valu <sil> that permeat everyth well thei don't do that in the public school becaus if you do that somebodi's gonna get tick off it's the wrong valu and <vocnois> <nois> why ar you do thi to my kid <nois> <vocnois> <sil> um <vocnois> so i think that's miss <sil> <vocnois> that's a problem within the school <sil> the public school <vocnois> <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> <sil> so just seem to be more distract from the educ process know mean when you're in the cathol school and you're in classroom <sil> thei deal with the disciplin <sil> if thei need to <sil> <sil> cours part the <he-problem> wai thei deal with it is thei take the real problem and send them <he-oh> back to the <laugh-public> <laugh-school> <vocnois> uh but in the public school you just have to deal with thi all the time and i think <he-that> <sil> <he-it> <sil> <unknown> it's harder for the teacher to teach <sil> <vocnois> <sil> caus there's too much stuff in the wai of <unknown> thei <he-need> <sil> realli thei're there to do <iver>
i don't know i hadn't thought about that <sil> uh <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <he-i> i don't <sil> <vocnois> <sil> no i don't <sil> i don't get the impress the valu as anyth <sil> <vocnois> to do with what thei're do in the school <iver>
well i get the sens that if there ar disciplin problem it's so hard to get anyth done <sil> <vocnois> <sil> solv them unless you unless somebodi bring a gun and wave it around the school ya know that's <sil> <vocnois> the big thing now but just that ya know <sil> <vocnois> <sil> it's just so hard to get anyth <ext-done> <vocnois> um <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and i think at that point the teacher get frustrat becaus thei don't see the support <sil> <vocnois> <sil> throughout through the administr and if thei do have <unknown> <sil> <unknown> <sil> thei have to wait til someth's pretti <sil> <vocnois> <sil> pretti egregi befor thei <sil> befor it's dealt with <sil> <iver>
yeah <sil> <nois> <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> thei're <he-unknown> <error-error=prevent=prevent> from do much <sil> <vocnois> <sil> yeah <sil> yeah i yeah i just don't think that thei <sil> can do much <vocnois> and i <unknown> i'm sure it's veri frustrat for them <sil> <vocnois> <sil> well and i know it is <unknown> we got friend who's <vocnois> <sil> wa a teacher she just retir a coupl year ago she's about our ag <vocnois> <sil> and uh <sil> it's it's veri differ now <sil> uh <sil> you know it's she said it's scari go into the classroom sometim <sil> <vocnois> <sil> uh and befor it wasn't that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a <he-unknown> <vocnois> know go and get someth dealt with it <sil> <nois> <vocnois> <sil> now you can't get back on it <sil> <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> no <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and she said ya know and <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and the <he-word> the last three or four year she just rode it out so she could retir <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and she us be veri dedic <vocnois> <sil> <nois> <sil> uh veri dedic teacher she just <sil> <nois> <sil> it wa a job then <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and <he-so> i hate see that happen to good teacher <iver>
right <sil> right when it's just frustrat after frustrat <vocnois> <sil> yeah that <sil> <vocnois> <sil> yeah <sil> but i don't see that in the cathol school now in the cathol school thei're not even paid as well as the public school <sil> <vocnois> <sil> but the environ is <sil> better for educ <sil> <iver>
<sil> no <sil> <iver>

<vocnois> there seem to be an aw lot of <sil> public some of it i mean some of it's pretti dramat a woman set fire to somebodi what happen in columbin <sil> it's veri dramat but <vocnois> when it happen in columbin it wa <sil> all that wa on the <ext-new> <sil> for a whole <sil> dai <cutoff-i=it> <cutoff-see=seem> seem like you <sil> anywher you look <vocnois> that's where it <nois-wa_thi> thing <nois-is> <sil> <nois-come> loos a littl <sil> there <vocnois> uh <vocnois> and that's <sil> all you could see and it wa like <sil> well how much do <ext-you> <sil> how much new is there to sai from minut to minut on everi channel <vocnois> how much do peopl realli need to keep hear it <iver>
and so i think it get driven home i think the media doe that in a lotta place thei pick someth that's sensat <he-and> <sil> keep <cutoff-m=?> <sil> thei're make it <sil> even more sensat like <sil> when <vocnois> <he-uh> <vocnois> <he-uh> john kennedi di <iver>

<vocnois> uh <sil> and at least it gave you a lot differ <sil> view <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> uh but the dispatch <sil> the onli reason i get the dispatch is i do wanna know what's go on local <iver>
<vocnois> you <iver>
right you <vocnois> you you can't realli ignor <vocnois> i've heard peopl sai i refus to read the dispatch well you got to know what's go on local i'm sorri <vocnois> but uh <iver>
the dai your trash is pick up <vocnois> what movi ar plai <vocnois> uh <sil> <vocnois> but i don't realli reli on heavili for new <iver>
even thei don't get fact right a lot of time <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> oh not veri right on <vocnois> and <sil> i would <vocnois> twenti the twenti year the first twenti year i work at the bureau <vocnois> i wa work in statist <sil> so i learn a lot about <sil> number and how to us them and <vocnois> what you can do with them how <sil> easili thei're misinterpret <vocnois> and my wife <vocnois> doe it it ha been a director of institut research at the univers <sil> <vocnois> um <vocnois> data <sil> research <sil> uh uh <vocnois> thei don't realli have other kind of research there <vocnois> um <iver>
and she sai <sil> it's amaz you can <vocnois> give these <cutoff-pep=peopl> give peopl number <sil> and thei immedi <sil> <vocnois> <sil> us them wrong <vocnois> thei just don't know how to us them <sil> <vocnois> uh thei <vocnois> complet misinterpret even though it's veri clearli state what thei're do <sil> and uh <vocnois> the newspap do that a lot too <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
peopl want a number <sil> thei don't wanna know the methodolog that goe into it <sil> or the the disclaim or footnot <sil> thei don't wanna read the footnot thei want a number <vocnois> uh <vocnois> when i work for the state on program we work on wa uh occup employ statist which wa collect uh <sil> number employe by differ occup in differ industri in differ area <sil> of ohio <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> which actual us <sil> origin start here the univers in ohio it wa a feder program depart labor it wa administ state level <vocnois> and uh <sil> it didn't <sil> didn't turn out veri well so thei switch it over to me <vocnois> uh <vocnois> <sil> for a varieti of reason which is not entir the univers's fault <vocnois> um <sil> <vocnois> <sil> thei had to reli on confidenti inform which we couldn't give them becaus it wa confidenti <sil> <vocnois> uh <vocnois> <sil> by feder law it wa confidenti we couldn't give it to them <sil> but thei need it <vocnois> so it <cutoff-ju=just> it wa just not a good on <sil> good wai to do busi <vocnois> <vocnois> uh <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and we would present inform ok there <vocnois> for <cutoff-in=instanc> <vocnois> there's thi thi number of peopl in an occup <vocnois> <vocnois> but there wa also a rang of error on there where peopl wouldn't notic that <vocnois> and thei would take that number as gospel <sil> and you just could not convinc them that <sil> well it realli mean more than that <vocnois> uh the big on would be uh wage level and we didn't realli <vocnois> at that time collect wage data so if we were kind of a conduit for <vocnois> there's sever differ depart in the <sil> the state <sil> and the feder govern collect <vocnois> occup data and we were kind of a conduit for the state for that <vocnois> um <sil> peopl would thei want an hourli rate thei didn't want a rang thei didn't want <vocnois> thei uh thei want a number and that's what that wa gospel <vocnois> but it's base on survei data so and and you know there's alwai statist error in there and stuff <sil> and <sil> try to explain that to we spent more time <sil> uh <sil> when peopl call up and give inform explain <vocnois> <sil> thi is what thi realli mean then the just give them the number <sil> that we spent more time do that <sil> uh <iver>
<vocnois> i think a lot of peopl don't <sil> understand <vocnois> a lot of peopl don't <vocnois> <sil> it's a mindset <sil> uh <sil> uh <vocnois> thei don't wanna deal with <sil> number a lot of peopl or thei want someth easi and simpl <vocnois> and that's what thei're look for <sil> thei don't realli wanna know <sil> what it mean <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> and a statist under <vocnois> ani <sil> <cutoff-ter=term> uh ani <sil> definit realli is noth more than an averag of some kind <iver>
and peopl <sil> don't seem to understand that <sil> <vocnois> uh it's not like you're <sil> collect data for a hundr uh the the entir popul of the entir univers you you're work with a sampl try to <vocnois> repres the entir univers well <sil> sometim <vocnois> it's good and sometim it's not <iver>
thei tri sampl <vocnois> well my brother rich wa on of the famili thei sampl <iver>
yeah <sil> and it just didn't work <iver>
and uh and the <sil> data thei collect is just <sil> i mean <vocnois> well i mean there ar some of those long form that go into a lot of detail but <vocnois> the basic <vocnois> <sil> data ha essenti how mani peopl live in the household and what ar their ag and race and that's it <vocnois> and that's not a <sil> i don't think that's a big secret myself but <iver>
<vocnois> right <iver>
<vocnois> and uh <sil> i think <sil> uh some of my feel about that sort of thing is uh <vocnois> is is <sil> color by the fact that i collect data <sil> for twenti year from <sil> employ <vocnois> uh <sil> i'm a lot more sympathet <sil> to that sort of thing <vocnois> um <sil> <vocnois> yeah just lot more sympathet to peopl collect data <sil> <vocnois> <iver>
yeah <sil> right <iver>
<vocnois> i had did on time <iver>
i had somebodi call and thei were do a survei and thei want know what i did for a live and when i told them thei said well we're done <laugh> <iver>

<vocnois> that's not enough <laugh> <iver>
<sil> <vocnois> <iver>
<sil> <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> yeah and <he-unknown> and i think it could work <sil> uh but i don't think peopl were <sil> readi to accept it <sil> <vocnois> and if <sil> the peopl <cutoff-filli=fill> give the inform aren't readi to accept it then <sil> <iver>
it's not gonna work <sil> <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> i'm not sure <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> <sil> i'm not sure that the <sil> <vocnois> <sil> the feder govern ha the <vocnois> <sil> abil to convinc enough peopl <sil> to do it <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and i don't think it's i i think the peopl that ar go to be <sil> readi to accept it <sil> <vocnois> <sil> and <vocnois> go with it ar <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> i don't think <exclud-you're> gonna get a <sil> good cross section popul <sil> i think the peopl would be will to understand it and go with it more if gonna be the more educ in thi sort of thing then you're leav out a larg part the popul so i'm not sure it's gonna give valid result anywai <sil> <iver>
period <sil> and it's that's a long process i mean thi ha been go on for two hundr year thi wai <sil> <vocnois> <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> and peopl ar suspici of govern <sil> ask question <nois> <sil> <iver>

<vocnois> <sil> uh <sil> which <he-we> we encourag that <iver>
becaus we could know that <sil> he'll need that somedai i would never have done it <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> but it uh he he would he's <vocnois> <iver>
and he's veri opinion <vocnois> and it's interest when he talk about <sil> uh <sil> anyth <sil> he love to talk about polit and social issu and that sort of thing <vocnois> <sil> uh <sil> you can tell that he's thought he's uh thought about it <sil> and hi <sil> yknow clearli formul what hi stanc is on it <vocnois> and he's <sil> veri articul about it <vocnois> uh <vocnois> sometim <sil> hi respons ar immatur but he's nineteen <iver>
i mean <vocnois> i'm sure at nineteen i wa sai some realli bizarr thing too <vocnois> uh but you can tell that he's thought about it <iver>
so <sil> <vocnois> becaus he and i alwai discuss <sil> polit and stuff <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> he had <cutoff-va=varieti> <vocnois> a varieti <vocnois> uh <sil> eighth grade is when he wa probabl in some wai hi better year <sil> uh <sil> he wa take a <cutoff-com=comput> <sil> had taken comput class for grade period <vocnois> <sil> and um <sil> <vocnois> it wasn't go well thei were teach keyboard well he learn that when he wa in third grade <sil> <vocnois> so we were talk to the teacher about it sai well he's disrupt he's suppos be do keyboard exercis and he's write program <vocnois> <vocnois> <vocnois> so anywai <sil> and he said i knew the first dai he wa in here he knew everi <cutoff-th=thing> thing that i wa gonna teach thi <unknown-couldn't_do_anyth> <sil> grade period well that <sil> kind of flew up a red flag to me and <laugh> <vocnois> can you give him other assign <vocnois> oh no he's got do what everybodi els is do <vocnois> so we went to the princip and <sil> i wa <sil> presid of the <sil> uh parent's advisori committe at the time so i had an easi access to the princip <vocnois> he took him out of the class immedi and put him in the librari and the librarian work <sil> with him on on on teach data base and spreadsheet <vocnois> uh <sil> applic to him <vocnois> but then <sil> but he had anoth teacher in the ninth grade who contact us hi english teacher <vocnois> and <error-he=she> she <cutoff-se=said> said told us uh said he know everyth i wanna teach <vocnois> so i want your permiss to give him a separ curriculum and she did she but he wa <sil> us read book like invis man <sil> my <cutoff-e=ellimon> <sil> ellimen ellison <vocnois> ralph ellison <sil> and ellimen guess it is <vocnois> anywai um <sil> <vocnois> and write paper on it he wa read like three book by an author and then try to write a short stori in that author's style <vocnois> and she still test him with the other kid just make sure she hadn't miss ani he hadn't miss anyth <vocnois> and she wa he wa us her grad school note to write paper and stuff like thi <sil> and uh <sil> it wa <sil> he love it <vocnois> and that's what he need <vocnois> though when he got to high school <sil> and we would talk to teacher about thei said no thei couldn't do that <vocnois> uh it wa veri frustrat <sil> frustrat <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
in the kin <iver>
in uh <sil> first grade hi teacher <sil> knew that he need that but the princip would not allow her to do it <sil> and that's on reason we put him in differ school for second grade <vocnois> uh <iver>
right <iver>
yeah and uh <sil> in the eighth grade he took the ninth grade profici test and pass all four part <sil> the first time <vocnois> uh <sil> so he wa learn what thei <vocnois> <sil> were <sil> teach which and that's anoth problem teach to a test but <vocnois> um <sil> that's a whole differ problem <vocnois> uh <sil> <iver>
right <iver>
and you learn what you have to to get through the test cours i did that <sil> when i wa here at school <iver>
uh <sil> if wa a class i <sil> knew i had to take i didn't realli want to <vocnois> that's what you do <vocnois> uh you just get through it <sil> uh <vocnois> <iver>
um-hum <vocnois> yeah <iver>
i wa bore in high school and i wasn't all that bright <iver>
<vocnois> and uh he need <sil> that but uh if i uh <iver>
it it wa difficult <sil> uh <sil> <vocnois> i can't tell you how mani time he had paper or project due at school that we'd just have to sit there with him to keep him focus on do it <vocnois> it's <sil> on of the <sil> uh diagnosis probabl <vocnois> a d h d which ha troubl <vocnois> with uh work memori how and how to get a project done and stuff like that <vocnois> uh we taught him how to do time line and <vocnois>  <error-gat=got> chart and thing like that <vocnois> um <sil> but it wa veri difficult for him be task orient <iver>
and it still is <vocnois> uh and that wa the problem with school he just wouldn't do the work <sil> i mean he give him a test and he could pass it <vocnois> do realli well but <sil> he just wouldn't do the work <sil> <iver>
well he wasn't realli diagnos then until just the last coupl year uh <sil> and part of the problem wa it wa fairli new and everybodi wa be diagnos a d h d uh and it wasn't realli there weren't realli good screen instrument for that there ar now <sil> uh <vocnois> and we've often felt that he need to have <vocnois> <sil> gift <vocnois> emphasi for gift children becaus <vocnois> uh <sil> and the uh <sil> the school wouldn't do that for him becaus hi grade weren't good enough becaus he didn't do the work <iver>
<vocnois> and <sil> the state of ohio's definit of <sil> a gift child is uh anyon who goe score seventi percent or higher on <sil> some test that thei give <vocnois> well uh yknow thei sai half the student in columbu school were gift student now that's not <sil> it can't it's imposs <vocnois> gift student there's fourteen differ characterist to look at you can't just look at <sil> on thing <iver>
and <vocnois> on of them thei'd look at in columbu wa <vocnois> uh <sil> how well he wa do in school <sil> well gift children you <sil> <cutoff-oft=often> have the high uh on of the highest drop rate of <sil> out rate in school thei're not do well <vocnois> so thei need to be taught differ <sil> and then thei cut thi monei uh <vocnois> <cutoff-mu=my> my feel is you know there's lot of <unknown> program in school there's sponsor by the feder govern particularli <sil> <vocnois> uh to help the the student ar that ar behind and that's import <iver>
and it should be import but there need the student that ar the other end need the help too <vocnois> lot of peopl think if you have a child that's gift that all your problem ar solv but it's not it's a differ set of problem there's person quirk that go with that emot issu <vocnois> <iver>
right <iver>
and the thei're not will to do that for gift student <iver>
onli if for those <unknown> student who ar <cutoff-achu=acheiv> high achiev who ar veri bright <vocnois> talent mai be truli gift <vocnois> who ar will to <vocnois> jump through the hoop <iver>
and those the and the other student were lost <vocnois> to the system <sil> and that's what happen with him <iver>
and and it's just <iver>
yeah <iver>
<vocnois> well we figur in a few year he will <sil> um <iver>
that's what we figur in a few year he'll be fine <sil> it's just get there <sil> it's been veri difficult <vocnois> i mean there's time when we didn't know where he wa <sil> for <sil> a week at <cutoff-tai=time> a week at a time he <vocnois> i wa drive <vocnois> <sil> lane avenu onc and saw him beg monei on the street and <sil> that's <sil> it's it's hit pretti heavi load to go through it realli is <iver>
right <iver>
no i had no idea where he wa <sil> uh and at the time <vocnois> my mother in law wa in a nurs home had alzheim and my father in law wa in the hospit <iver>
<vocnois> uh essenti dy <sil> and so we were deal with all of thi <vocnois> at the same time and it wa i mean there wa on night i rememb we were readi to leav the hospit about seven thirti we check to see if there wa ani messag at home to see if we'd heard from him <vocnois> uh <sil> and got a messag that my mother in law had fallen and she wa in an <sil> emerg room the same hospit fortun so went down there <vocnois> then on the wai home <sil> got a phone call on the cell phone <vocnois> uh <sil> from the hospit that my father in law had to had some bleed so we had to go back to hospit <sil> and then we went around drive around look for my son thi wa all and thi wa not unusu <vocnois> it wa a horribl period <sil> <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> i think what <sil> made my wife and i the angriest wa that he's the onli on that realli could control hi behavior the other couldn't <iver>

<vocnois> <iver>
mm-hmm <iver>
mm-hmm <iver>
<vocnois> well i i think that <vocnois> my opinion is that if you ain't go to school and you're not go you're not work and everyth you should uh <vocnois> be do someth besid <sil> caus problem yknow <sil> and a lot of kid that's all thei realli wanna do nowadai is just <vocnois> caus aggrav to peopl <sil> <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> the lack of disciplin at the home <vocnois> <iver>
well i've been <cutoff-th=the> see i wasn't much i <cutoff-w=wa> <sil> my <vocnois> be here and my daughter be there i didn't realli have the uh <sil> time with her that i wish i would've had yknow but uh <vocnois> uh <sil> her mother would yknow wouldn't did her all right and everyth but <vocnois> i wish that i would've been more involv in her <vocnois> grow up <vocnois> and <vocnois> i think two peopl famili ar gener better <sil> yknow for <vocnois> not necessarili live be <cutoff-lo=love> yknow it about be marri and everyth but <iver>
at least be abl to be a part of their <sil> your kid's <vocnois-life> <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
mm-hmm <iver>
mm-hmm <iver>
<vocnois> well i believ it's qualiti not quantiti <vocnois> uh <sil> ideal <vocnois> <sil> yknow um on parent would be there be it <sil> male or femal well yknow man or <cutoff-wi=wife> <vocnois> man or <cutoff-wo=woman> or ladi <vocnois> but uh <vocnois> <sil> but yknow your qualiti time's more import <sil> yknow <vocnois> mayb go come home and you <vocnois> and all you wanna do is sit down and start watch tv or drink beer or whatev yknow and not spend ani time with your child it doesn't matter <vocnois-wheth=whether> you're <vocnois> there all dai or whether you're there for two hour <sil> <vocnois> <iver>
<sil> well i believ that's wai it wa origin set up you know so <vocnois> <iver>
mm-hmm <iver>
i person don't believ that thei should be allow to <sil> <vocnois> becaus i believ thei thei should have the male gender as well as the femal gender <vocnois> for a proper bring up <vocnois> <iver>
balanc <vocnois-parent> <vocnois> <iver>
hum-um <vocnois> <iver>
i don't see ani reason for it myself but uh <sil> that's <vocnois> interest uh um <vocnois> yknow when thei when the first when the uh <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> when time began yknow accord <sil> my <cutoff-f=philosophi> <vocnois> uh <vocnois> <sil> what i believ in and everyth yknow it wa <vocnois> man and woman got marri yknow and <vocnois> and reason thei got marri wa becaus of procreat yknow keep the <vocnois> keep the uh popul go <vocnois> uh <vocnois> i think that's the wai it wa set up origin so <vocnois> i have no problem with a man be with a man or woman be with a woman but <vocnois> um <sil> if <vocnois> if that wa the relationship <vocnois> for everybodi <iver>
<laugh-then> uh <vocnois> then obvious the <sil> the civil gonna be dead yknow so <vocnois> <iver>
mm-hmm <iver>
mm-hmm <sil> well i've i've had gai friend and uh <vocnois> uh <sil> on of them work at a t and t and he retir <sil> and then uh <sil> and the other on wa on a disabl and everyth so uh <vocnois> that never even came up in their relationship <vocnois> nor did it come up in uh a <cutoff-d=differ> <sil> anoth coupl friend that i've had yknow that thei uh <vocnois> thei more or less <sil> took care of each other yknow <sil> so <sil> <vocnois> <iver>
i don't agre with it we had gai in there when i wa in there yknow so <iver>
yeah i mean you gener <sil> could <vocnois> i mean thei didn't broadcast it obvious but <iver>
<sil> yknow thei uh <sil> i mean my person would i would person wouldn't care yknow as long as uh if i wa in a foxhol with somebodi i could care less whether he is gai or not <laugh> as long as he's shoot a gun yknow to help me out if i wa in troubl so <vocnois> <sil> <iver>
i think it's good and uh <sil> i've yknow i think women ar ar capabl of do that my onli <sil> disagr with it is that i'd have a real problem <sil> be in that foxhol and have a woman besid me and <sil> uh <sil> she'd get shot yknow i don't know how i could deal with that it'd be <vocnois> it <sil> men i don't know if you you <sil> you <sil> women have <vocnois> yknow differ feel but with about each other than thei do with men and men have differ feel about each other <vocnois> uh than thei do with women and everyth and thei tend to be more protect <iver>
<sil> so <vocnois> um <sil> where a man yknow you kind of feel like he can carri hi own weight yknow a woman you mai not <sil> you mai <sil> feel like you have to <sil> do <sil> a special thing in order to uh <sil> uh to keep her from get kill yknow or someth or <cutoff-k=kill> just shot or someth <vocnois> so i wouldn't <sil> person i don't like that myself <sil> <vocnois> but i ain't had no problem with them be like a pilot or someth like that yknow <sil> <iver>
<vocnois> <iver>
<sil> <iver>
<vocnois> i wouldn't like it to be that wai but uh basic when i wa in the servic the <cutoff-ta=unknown> the women uh <sil> had their own <sil> area of the servic that thei <vocnois> were allow to be basic nurs and stuff yknow <iver>
uh <vocnois> 
<nois> <sil> and <vocnois> thei had thei you know thei went through their own train and everyth we didn't <vocnois> interfac with each other or noth like that you know i mean you might see on <sil> walk <vocnois> or march somewher but <sil> as far as fratern you weren't allow to <iver>
um hum <iver>
um hum <iver>
um <iver>
no not realli i mean differ cultur and everyth uh <vocnois> but <sil> i i went to school with black so i mean that wasn't that big a thing except for the <sil> influx <vocnois> of the you know <sil> i didn't realiz how mani <sil> were be draft or be enlist into the servic at the time and everyth or how mani actual were even in the <sil> in the countri you know <iver>
but it didn't bother me <vocnois> uh <sil> religion's basic everybodi when i wa in there back in the sixti the i mean everybodi wa pretti much a christian you know christian either cathol or someth like that but uh <sil> nowadai you know you have the uh <vocnois> uh <sil> more outspoken <error=isla=islam> <cutoff-mu=muslim> muslim and <error> uh <vocnois> islam and uh <cutoff-judia=judiasm> and judaism and everyth so <vocnois> and there again i don't have a problem with that you know becaus you <sil> you got to <sil> meet yourself <vocnois> you know you got to make your peac with your maker becaus you know <vocnois> if you believ in religion you're <vocnois> you're here temporarili for an etern later on you know <iver>
um hum <iver>
um hum <iver>
well i <he-?> on thing uh you know be uh <vocnois> uh <vocnois> i came from basic a poor <cutoff-neigh=neighborhood> <error-poo=poor> poor uh <vocnois> uh lifestyl uh earli life and everyth you know so uh <vocnois> um <sil> if anyth i guess it kind of made me neg uh <sil> toward peopl that <sil> had an influenc had monei <vocnois> and <sil> didn't do ani <sil> thing good with it you know <vocnois> i'm a firm believ that if you got someth that you should share it with other other peopl <vocnois> i don't alwai <sil> practic what i preach but <sil> you know that's <sil> i'd be a good philosophi to live by <vocnois> uh <sil> <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois> and peopl of other religion and everyth um <vocnois> you know i learn a lot about religion when i <cutoff-w=wa> i wa rais baptist basic but uh <sil> i <vocnois> practic more cathol than anyth els now uh <sil> but i'm <sil> gener pretti knowledg about judaism and muslim and <vocnois> everyth just becaus i find it <sil> interest <iver>
um <vocnois> you know wa in sixti nine when i went in so <vocnois> you know you can <vocnois> kind of figur that it wa <nois> the <iver>
okai <vocnois> <sil> it wa kind of uh <laugh> it wa differ when i becaus see becaus when i went in <vocnois> uh <sil> and you know well i never had ani problem with a black person or or i didn't realli care you know as long as thei uh <vocnois> did their job and everyth i'm basic the same wai todai <vocnois> uh <iver>
but peopl come from other <vocnois> citi <vocnois> like chicago new york yknow and place like that where thei were <vocnois> treat poorli by white you know thei <vocnois> um <vocnois> thei tend to <sil> act differ toward you and everyth <vocnois> until thei realiz that you weren't like that you know <sil> uh we onli had on racial incid when i wa in the servic uh <vocnois> where it wa <sil> we were predominantli white <vocnois> uh <sil> platoon <vocnois> and <sil> the <vocnois> becaus we work in missil and stuff you know so uh <vocnois> and <sil> then <sil> the secur cop were <error-pa=predominantli> <sil> abov us and thei were predominantli black you know <vocnois> and i don't know what happen someth <sil> happen on time there wa onli like twenti peopl in our <vocnois> whole uh <vocnois> platoon it wa all in the same barrack <vocnois> and uh <vocnois> some gui said someth <vocnois> off color to on of them or someth like that you know and <vocnois> got kind of out of hand for a while but <vocnois> you know thank god noth <cutoff-r=realli> realli happen <iver>
um hum <iver>
i think that the <iver>
i think societi is todai of todai is less toler of uh <sil> a lot of thing that thei see where get by with stuff you know <vocnois> and thei're more vocal about it as oppos to be violent about it back in <vocnois> the sixti and stuff you know uh <sil> not here <sil> but you know down south there were peopl still get <sil> hung and stuff you know for be <sil> a black or someth and uh <vocnois> know there ar bad black and there's bad white too you know <sil> so <vocnois> but not all of them ar <vocnois> you know <sil> ar that wai <iver>
um hum <iver>
but that's what i mean it's more you know it's thei're thei're more vocal about it more uh uh more 
t v about and everyth that stuff's been go on for year so <sil> <iver>
um hum <sil> <iver>
well i think it's more <sil> capabl of be violent becaus of the uh <sil> inform avail to peopl about bomb and stuff like that you know or <vocnois> <sil> befor you know if somebodi got mad at somebodi you know you <vocnois> might <sil> thei might shoot them or someth but <vocnois> <sil> not <ext-kill> a hundr innoc peopl for no reason <iver>
um hum <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> no i i person don't becaus uh <vocnois> <sil> yknow i've seen mayb not to the degre of the violenc but mean i still knew it wa violent uh <sil> stuff when i wa kid you know that didn't make me a violent person <sil> so <iver>
<sil> i think that's a cop out myself <vocnois> <iver>

like sit out <he-on> the street all the time like <sil> uh <sil> honk the horn ring the bell do the <ext-whistl> the <vocnois> realli annoi chant um <vocnois> i had class in the b and z <sil> build <vocnois> that we just had to cancel becaus thei were too loud <iver>
um <sil> yeah across street the dental <sil> and the hospit <vocnois> so peopl were realli loud down there <iver>
and we couldn't have class <he-and> <sil> in addit thei were like try to tip over buse and throw stone at them <iver>
when thei drove by i guess <iver>
<vocnois> there's no need to attack student over it and <sil> i read some articl <vocnois> in the lantern i don't know why i read that but um <vocnois> i hate that paper but anywai <vocnois> um i read some articl that the gui said he's not try to attack student he just want them to get annoi so thei'll <ext-go> whine to their parent about how the univers doe it <vocnois> and then thei can all fight the establish and <sil> <iver>
it make me <sil> angri that peopl like that even get <sil> monei <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> no it didn't as a matter of fact i told my parent yknow <nois> univers is handl it <vocnois> so well by <ext-not> <vocnois> give them the monei becaus thei don't deserv it <vocnois> yknow <vocnois> and <iver>
yeah <he-and> <iver>
yeah <sil> um <sil> <vocnois> it wa just <he-realli> <sil> disgust how thei <ext-behav> <vocnois> <he-and> <vocnois> a lot of yell at <ext-student> <sil> <he-and> that wa <ext-realli> unnecessari <sil> i thei <vocnois> just total approach it from the wrong <sil> point and <vocnois> i mean there were some student that actual <he-were> <sil> support them <iver>

we want it to keep on go <vocnois> <sil> but <sil> <he-it> <vocnois> thei just didn't need to <sil> do like that and then i think onc thei notic that the uh <vocnois> common were gonna open without them thei realiz that <sil> univers is function <sil> or wa function fine without them <iver>
and decid to go back to their job <vocnois> <cutoff-i=if> if you notic the first time that thei vote <vocnois> thei vote down thi propos the propos that their vote on thi week is the exact same on <iver>

<vocnois> <sil> um <sil> i am sign up for architectur right now <vocnois> which <sil> i like architectur but i think there's probabl more time <vocnois> into it than i'm readi to <sil> actual commit into it <iver>
and so i think i'll probabl end up chang i don't know what to it'd probabl be more toward the educ line <iver>
um just i mean i like everyth about architectur i mean that's actual <vocnois> what i do as a job right now i mean i'm <vocnois> <sil> like build thing i'm <vocnois> like ad on a <sil> bedroom and a bathroom <iver>
onto a hous <sil> but <sil> it's just <sil> more time consum than i think i'm readi <sil> <iver>
to put into it <sil> <iver>
<sil> um <vocnois> <iver>
ye and no i mean <sil> in high school it wa a bunch of littl thing here it's <sil> not so much a lot of thing <iver>
it's <cutoff-s=it's> <sil> major thing that you have to do that ar a lot more time consum <iver>
yeah exactli <sil> <vocnois> which is on of the thing i ran into architectur where <vocnois> i mean we onli had yknow on or two paper we had to write <iver>
but there were on or two <vocnois> eight or nine page paper about a build that you had to go put <sil> hour worth of research into and then sketch and <vocnois> and it wa just <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> exactli yeah <vocnois> <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> um <vocnois> <sil> actual <vocnois> <sil> i guess it's someth that's alwai start <sil> sort of been there <vocnois> alwai been real big on just build thing mean been <vocnois> real big hand on <vocnois> <sil> and <sil> last summer i help my dad <vocnois> uh <vocnois> put a garag onto hi hous <vocnois> <sil> um <vocnois> like i mean liter i mean we pour the foundat and everyth like build everyth up from there <vocnois> <sil> and it turn out realli well and i mean it wa <sil> realli fun to do i mean <vocnois> it's <vocnois> i like it a lot better than be stuck <sil> insid all the time <iver>
and <vocnois> just ya know sort of do the same old same old everydai there it wa alwai someth differ i have to be outsid <sil> and it wa just a lot <sil> easier to do <vocnois> <sil> <iver>
um <laugh> actual it's more <sil> it's almost actual turn into like a self busi <sil> um <sil> like i said it start out with my dad and then peopl would ask me what i wa do i'd tell them <vocnois> thei'd be like oh i have some thing around the hous that need to be done and <vocnois> so i'd go there and thei'd tell peopl and <iver>
i'd get more <sil> peopl ask me for that and i mean it turn out pretti nice i'm make <vocnois> about ten or eleven buck an hour <iver>
<sil> and i mean it's basic ani time i have free i mean it's not like i have a set schedul of when i have to work thing like that it's just <vocnois> whenev i feel like i have to do it <iver>
i do it so <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
um <sil> actual oddli enough that's what i'm put in <vocnois> <iver>
on of the bathroom right now is a jacuzzi <vocnois> um that's <sil> not realli too hard but the hardest <sil> thing to do is electr work <vocnois> like it's just becaus it's more intimid <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> than it is <iver>
difficult <sil> exactli get <iver>
get electrocut or someth yeah <vocnois> <sil> that just doesn't appeal to me too much but i mean it's <sil> realli not too difficult i mean as long as you're <vocnois> care and <iver>
think about thing i mean it's pretti easi to do <iver>
yeah we live <vocnois> <sil> um <vocnois> we move about <sil> five or six year ago <vocnois> um <vocnois> and the hous we had befor wa some big like eighti nineti year old hous <iver>
<sil> and <sil> i mean obvious it need a lot of repair becaus it's pretti old and there were just thing that he'd do and i guess just <vocnois> pick up watch him see what he would do that's <iver>
where it took me to <iver>
<sil> and it just sort of <vocnois> spark an interest in me i guess and <vocnois> it just grew from there <iver>
yeah <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
yeah i've run into that a lot i think <sil> part of it wa the high school i went to i mean i've gone to <vocnois> cathol school all my life or whatev <vocnois> and <vocnois> obvious i've run into <vocnois> a lot more of the wealthier type peopl who <vocnois> either just don't have time or don't have the interest and just pai peopl to do it <iver>
and as a result <sil> <unknown> like there ar <vocnois> kid my ag and stuff like that that i've talk to i mean thei have no idea what's go on <iver>
which <sil> i mean isn't necessarili a bad thing but <sil> i mean it's someth that's definit notic in there <iver>
oh did you <iver>
um-hum <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
oh yeah it's <iver>
oh yeah <iver>
yeah plu i mean you <laugh> save a lot of monei too i mean <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
<vocnois> kind of i've seen a few of like infomerci on stuff like that <sil> um but i can't sai anyth too <vocnois> seriou ha come up from it <iver>
um <vocnois> i mean i'd that's definit a possibl for career wise down the road but <sil> um <vocnois> i don't know i'll have to see <vocnois> <laugh-sort_of_where_that> take me <vocnois> <iver>
i went <ext-to> <vocnois> <exclud-name> for grade school <sil> and <exclud-name> for high school <vocnois> <iver>
<sil> um <vocnois> <exclud-name> <sil> that is on <exclud-name> road <iver>
like nineti nine east <exclud-name> road or someth like that <iver>
uh <nois> <sil> it <cutoff-w=wasn't> <sil> wasn't anyth too huge i think it had about twelv hundr peopl in it or so <iver>
um <vocnois> it i mean it wa <sil> pretti good place i mean look <vocnois> back on it <sil> i rememb a lot better than when i wa actual there <iver>
obvious i mean it wa just someth that <sil> just i mean you don't realli appreci it until <vocnois> <sil> you've gone through it <iver>
and then <vocnois> <sil> rememb back on it <iver>
yeah <sil> <iver>
um <vocnois> <sil> i don't realli think there's <sil> ani huge differ <vocnois> um <vocnois> <sil> i can sai from what i've seen <vocnois> <sil> the peopl that went to the cathol school <vocnois> um <sil> thei ar a littl bit more disciplin and know how to like organ their time better and thing like that like i mean most of my friend have gone to the <vocnois> public school ar <laugh> realli overwhelm by the amount of stuff that thei have to do here <iver>
<sil> um <sil> and i definit i mean <sil> i've <vocnois> think i went to like kindergarten in the public school so i don't realli know <vocnois> too much about like the kind of curriculum and thing that thei had to do <vocnois> but i know i mean as far as go to <exclud-name> <vocnois> a lot of the stuff like in math and thing like that <vocnois> <sil> that i'm do now <vocnois> is stuff i alreadi cover in high school so i alreadi have a basi for it <iver>
um so i think that <sil> part definit help wherea most of my other friend you know thei're kind of lost thei don't know <vocnois> exactli what thei're do <vocnois> um where like said i've <vocnois> alreadi <vocnois> done all the stuff that we're do now and know <vocnois> how to go about it and <iver>
how to do it so i think that would probabl be about the biggest differ just <sil> realli the amount of <sil> educ you get 
<iver>
i would sai for the most part that that <sil> not <vocnois> is not realli true <iver>
um <sil> i would <cutoff-s=sai> tend to sai most peopl i know ar <sil> at least fairli ethic i mean <vocnois> <laugh-there's_no_more> <vocnois> sinist group than the other that i know <iver>
i mean obvious everyon ha their dark side but i'd sai <cutoff-nm=?> <vocnois> in gener peopl ar <vocnois> pretti good peopl <iver>
i mean <vocnois> there's noth bad about them or anyth that thei <iver>
<sil> <iver>
<vocnois> oh yeah all the time <iver>
yeah that part wa no differ i mean <iver>
no <iver>
um <vocnois> <nois> <vocnois> there were on or two <iver>
<vocnois> um <vocnois> i guess that would be a slightli differ part i'm <error-non=not> <vocnois> not realli sure how big of a problem that is in public school but <vocnois> mean on be the girl that did get pregnant she end up go to public school the next year <iver>
um so i'm sure that <laugh-probabl> increas the rate in public school from <iver>
the cathol school <iver>
expel <iver>
um <iver>
what thei do <vocnois> uh <vocnois> thei have like up to four or five month <vocnois> the first four or five month pregnanc thei're aloud to maintain <vocnois> onc thei start to show <sil> thei don't let them go to the school anymor just for <vocnois> their <vocnois> uh health of the babi <iver>
um <sil> so thei <vocnois> sort of send them on their wai or whatev <vocnois> and she did have the opportun to come back <iver>
uh <error-onsh=onc> <cutoff-th=the> <vocnois> she wa through with her pregnanc but she did end up just go to a public school <iver>
<laugh> <vocnois> kind of yeah <vocnois> um <vocnois> <laugh-actual_with> thi case i do know what happen to the father i think he end up move to colorado <laugh> um <iver>
no noth at all <vocnois> it it wa known that he wa the father <vocnois> like i said i mean <sil> he <laugh> <vocnois> he wa kind of <vocnois> uh <vocnois> just <laugh-on_of_those> kid <vocnois> and <sil> i mean he didn't listen to anyon or anyth and <vocnois> he end up <vocnois> like run awai from home basic and like i said go out to colorado <vocnois> and like on hi drive down there hi car broke down and hi parent like wire him monei <vocnois> for him to get a plane ticket to come back and he end up just take the monei fix hi car with it and <cutoff-kep=kept> <sil> kept on go <iver>
so i mean he wa just <vocnois> on of those peopl i guess i mean there wa realli no hope for <iver>
um <sil> i probabl would <vocnois> like i said just mainli more for the educ standpoint of it <iver>
um not necessarili the cathol belief <iver>
or anyth like that i mean <vocnois> that's <vocnois> someth that <vocnois> i don't know i'd sorta <vocnois> make known to them <sil> but not someth that i'd <vocnois> realli push on them <iver>
um sort of let them make their own decis when thei got older what thei want to do <vocnois> where thei want to go with it <iver>
<vocnois> um <vocnois> well as far as my mom goe she's <vocnois> real into the cathol faith and i mean she made me <vocnois> alwai go to church and thing like that <iver>
and i think that's probabl why i feel the wai i do now <iver>
why i wouldn't push it on them <vocnois> caus that's almost made me be resent toward be cathol just the fact that i had it forc on me <iver>
for <vocnois> about seventeen or eighteen year <vocnois> and just reach the point where i'd <vocnois> had enough of it and i mean i didn't want <vocnois> anyth about it <iver>
and i mean that's not to sai that <sil> i don't <sil> like be cathol or whatev <iver>
it doesn't so much bother me it's just have it forc on me <vocnois> like i said just sort of give me a differ opinion of it <iver>
<vocnois> and <sil> the real <vocnois> mean behind it so <iver>
<vocnois> nope <vocnois> <iver>
she doe know that i don't go to church <iver>
um <iver>
she <vocnois> doesn't so much mind anymor <vocnois> i mean sinc i've <vocnois> turn <sil> eighteen <vocnois> i mean ever sinc then it's been no <vocnois> problem or anyth i mean she's sort of let me have my own opinion <iver>
but i mean i honestli do think i'd at least go to church on occas if <vocnois> it wasn't forc on me <sil> <vocnois> i mean it just got sort of <cutoff-ri=ridicul> <vocnois> just <vocnois> to the point of be <laugh-ridicul> <vocnois> <ext-go> <vocnois> seventeen eighteen year <vocnois> everi singl week <iver>
of the year i mean <vocnois> it just got to the point where <vocnois> i'd had enough and <vocnois> i didn't wanna <laugh-go_anymor> <iver>
um <vocnois> <ext-my> both of them ar older <vocnois> my <ext-sister's> like twenti seven twenti eight and my brother's twenti four <iver>
um <vocnois> thei have start again recent <vocnois> uh thei sort of hit the same point where <vocnois> thei'd just had enough of it too and stop <iver>
um but <sil> recent thei ar <vocnois> get into go to church <vocnois> um <iver>
um neither on of them's marri or ha kid <vocnois> uh <vocnois> my <ext-sister> <vocnois> doe <error-hasv=have boyfriend for um <vocnois> probabl like three year or so <vocnois> and there is talk about them <sil> like marriag and kid and stuff like that with them <iver>
um like thei're live togeth thing like that <iver>
um <vocnois> as far as my brother goe <vocnois> <laugh-i_can't> sai i <laugh-realli> see my brother too often <vocnois> um he doe live in town <vocnois> um but <sil> usual he's <sil> either at work becaus he work fulltim then he ha <vocnois> he's a part time student columbu state <vocnois> um <vocnois> so i don't realli see him dure the dai and then <vocnois> at night he usual goe out doe hi thing i go out and do my thing <vocnois> so i mean as far as what's go on with him <vocnois> i realli don't know but <cutoff-i=it> i know i mean there's noth <vocnois> real seriou <laugh-go_on> with him or anyth like that <sil> <iver>
um <vocnois> not realli <vocnois> he <vocnois> i mean <sil> he <vocnois> obvious <laugh-went> to church too <vocnois> for <sil> at least a few year <vocnois> um <vocnois> while thei were <vocnois> my parent were still togeth <vocnois> but <sil> i mean sinc then i mean there's realli <vocnois> <sil> noth about him <iver>
<vocnois> not realli i mean <vocnois> she <vocnois> i don't <laugh-know> my mom's kind of weird like that she <vocnois> she more believ in the religion aspect of it <sil> not so much as what the cathol believ about it <vocnois> um <vocnois> like their view on outsid of religi matter <iver>
um she just more <error-agre=agre> <cutoff-towar=toward> <vocnois> with their <vocnois> view of god or what not <iver>
as oppos to what the cathol church actual think is correct and <iver>
what should be done <iver>
yeah <iver>
yeah <iver>
um <vocnois> probabl would've been about six year ago <vocnois> i'd been in <vocnois> sixth or seventh grade <iver>
yeah i live with my mom sinc then <iver>
uh my dad is remarri <iver>
um <vocnois> <ext-he's> <sil> probabl been marri for <vocnois> four or five year <iver>
she's pretti nice i mean <vocnois> she's <vocnois> definit at least standabl and <iver>
accept so <iver>
<laugh> <vocnois> <iver>
um-hum <iver>
yeah <iver>
um <vocnois> ye and no <vocnois> like i said i think the averag person <vocnois> is pretti decent person i mean i don't think that <vocnois> there's <vocnois> anyth violent or that <vocnois> <laugh-there's> anyth wrong with them <vocnois> <sil> but at the same time <vocnois> it's just the media focus on the on's that ar out of control and make a big deal of <vocnois> the on that ar out of control <vocnois> and i think that sort of what peopl pick up the percept to be i mean thei don't <vocnois> thei don't show about like when peopl ar help peopl out or thing like that when the local high school's <vocnois> like volunt at <vocnois> like the local senior citizen' home or someth like that <iver>
instead thei pick up on oh so and so wa arrest for drug deal todai he <vocnois> you know <vocnois> so and so ag and <vocnois> thei sort of give background on him and that's <sil> what everyon base their view on <vocnois> it seem to be is that everyon turn to the media to see what's go on <vocnois> when the media's onli show on side of the stori i mean there's definit much more out there <vocnois> that's go on than thei're <vocnois> tell you <vocnois> um <vocnois> so i realli don't see a big <sil> problem with <vocnois> the wai <vocnois> the <vocnois> america's go or whatev the youth <vocnois> um <vocnois> and like sai i wouldn't sai it's ani <vocnois> <laugh-wors> than ani past gener <vocnois> i mean other than like i mean obvious like gun and thing like that ar be around <vocnois> but <vocnois> simpli the reason be wa becaus in past gener thei weren't around for it <iver>
um i mean <vocnois> 
there were thing out but there's noth like what thei have todai you know the small littl hand gun and thing like that thei're real easi <vocnois> carryabl and conceal i mean <sil> like you know back in the sixti stuff like that i mean thei had switchblad thing <laugh-like_that> yeah i mean <vocnois> i mean there's realli noth <vocnois> too differ <iver>
exactli <iver>
yeah <iver>
<sil> um <sil> i sort of agre with the fact that <sil> if someon want a gun thei'll get a gun <vocnois> it doesn't matter what thei do to try to make it <sil> so peopl can't get their hand on gun <vocnois> thei're basic alwai gonna be around and peopl ar alwai gonna get them if thei want them <iver>
i think more what thei need to do is <sil> in strict <sil> or <vocnois> uh just make stiffer penalti to peopl that carri the gun or that ar involv in shoot and thing like that <vocnois> um <vocnois> becaus i mean for the most part <vocnois> i mean peopl realli don't get <vocnois> too badli punish for thing <vocnois> i mean if you look in other countri i mean <vocnois> like peopl <vocnois> like the <vocnois> asian countri place like that i mean thei have realli strict law <vocnois> i mean if you even get caught for like vandal you're still serv jail time and you get <laugh> you get pretti badli punish for it <vocnois> i mean some case thei'll even <sil> chain you up and beat you in public for it <vocnois> um <vocnois> i think <vocnois> not to sound too veng but i think if more thing went that wai <vocnois> that there'd be a much less problem with it <vocnois> um i think just the fact that the jail ar so over crowd now that thei know that thei're gonna get good time and parol and all sort of stuff <vocnois> that if you shoot someon you're <vocnois> you're not even gonna get thirti dai in jail and <vocnois> you're gonna be <vocnois> let go i mean that's an awfulli small price to pai for <iver>
just carri around a gun and shoot someon <iver>
um-hum <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
yeah <iver>
yeah <iver>
um <vocnois> i don't realli know honestli i mean <vocnois> it's definit careless natur and definit someth ha to be done to 'em <iver>
but at the same time it's not like thei had the intent <sil> to do it <vocnois> so i can't sai anyth too incred sever <vocnois> um <sil> but i mean i almost think it should be <nois> consid basic <sil> child neglect thing like that um <vocnois> basic the same penalti that you'd run into for that <vocnois> um <vocnois> but <vocnois> i mean <unknown> thei obvious do need to make it more sever becaus obvious your kid <vocnois> ha the opportun to kill themselv with a gun <iver>
but <vocnois> i mean that's just <vocnois> sort of the curiou natur of kid i mean thei <vocnois> obvious thei're gonna <vocnois> get into stuff and thing like that and i mean it's not alwai the <vocnois> parent's fault i mean <vocnois> i <cutoff-kn=know> there ar a lot of peopl i mean <vocnois> i think just in the new a few week ago thei <vocnois> had a shoot that happen coupl of year ago and thei just came to a verdict on it <vocnois> and the parent like left in a <cutoff-t=top> top drawer of a tool shed that wa lock <vocnois> and the kid knew where the kei wa he climb up on the ladder unlock it and he end up shoot himself with it <vocnois> i mean as far as that goe i mean there's realli noth more he could do i mean <iver>
yeah i mean <iver>
it's just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that's <sil> sort of kid for you i mean thei just <vocnois> obvious thei're gonna be curiou about thing <vocnois> and <vocnois> the parent definit doe have to be held respons for it <vocnois> but i don't know <cutoff-w=what> to what degre <vocnois> that thei should go with it <iver>
noth seriou no <iver>
um <vocnois> not realli i mean <vocnois> i've been with a few peopl that have <sil> just <nois> i mean just <vocnois> randomli gotten kind of jump i mean thei didn't steal anyth thei just <vocnois> beat them up for no reason or what not <iver>
but i mean it's wa noth too seriou or violent i mean <iver>
thei didn't like pull out ani weapon or anyth like that it wa just a fistfight yeah <iver>
happen sometim <sil> um <vocnois> probabl would've been my <cutoff-ow=?> <sil> my freshman year in high school <vocnois> um we were just <vocnois> walk down high street and <laugh> i guess we were <vocnois> wrong place at the wrong time and <vocnois> some peopl <vocnois> were like yell stuff <vocnois> and we couldn't make out what thei were sai <iver>
and on of my friend wa like what'd you sai <vocnois> and he took that as like a threat or someth like walk over <iver>
and just <laugh-start> pick a fight with him <iver>
just <iver>
to beat him up <vocnois> but <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
um <iver>
thei probabl would've been <vocnois> um about senior in high school or so <iver>
junior or senior in high school i mean it wasn't anyth too <vocnois> seriou it wa just more <vocnois> i guess a testosteron trip or someth <vocnois> <iver>
oh <unknown> definit yeah like i said <unknown> part no differ <iver>
uh <iver>
um <vocnois> it's probabl would be wors <vocnois> i mean actual <vocnois> just wait for my last experi i heard coupl peopl talk about it thei were talk about it <iver>
yeah <vocnois> um <vocnois> and <sil> i can sai <vocnois> there ar some drug that <sil> i don't realli consid to be too threaten or <vocnois> that i'm realli too worri about peopl us <vocnois> um <vocnois> like i mean just the whole idea with marijuana thing like that i mean <sil> it doesn't realli <vocnois> bother me so much i mean <vocnois> cigarett and alcohol basic do the same thing it doe <iver>
and i mean those ar legal <vocnois> obvious <vocnois> um <vocnois> obvious thing like onc you start get into cocain p c p thing like that those ar a littl bit more seriou <iver>
and <vocnois> obvious a lot more danger and <vocnois> i definit think that there is a bigger problem with <vocnois> the bigger drug <vocnois> onc you get it to like colleg or whatev <iver>
as back into <cutoff-gr=grade?> into high school <iver>
um <iver>
i've been to parti and thing like that where peopl were shoot up with like heroin and thing like that <vocnois> um <iver>
and <vocnois> i mean that's <vocnois> pretti <vocnois> i don't know extrem yeah <vocnois> um <vocnois> so i mean it's definit i would sai thi more seriou drug ar definit <iver>
much more wide us onc you get into colleg <vocnois> um but i mean as far as like the pot and just thing like that i mean i can't sai i see ani differ between <iver>
here and high school <vocnois> ecstasi is the drug i've been hear about <vocnois> a <laugh> a lot the past <sil> like year or two and it's definit someth that's grown <iver>
just like almost out of control <iver>
um <vocnois> it's pretti <vocnois> danger drug i would sai for the most part <vocnois> um not so much <vocnois> the get high part of it but just what goe into it <iver>
uh like i know on of the <vocnois> poison us in it is like rat poison or someth like that <vocnois> i mean just obvious the idea of put rat poison into you when it's meant to kill a rat <vocnois> obvious seem pretti danger <iver>
um-hum <iver>
yeah <iver>
yeah <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
yeah <iver>
um <iver>
ecstasi ye <vocnois> there ar a few peopl that i know that <vocnois> us it <iver>
like on a fairli regular basi even <iver>
um <vocnois> i mean noth's happen to them and <vocnois> i mean like i said <vocnois> the high get high part of it <vocnois> isn't so much of the problem it's just what goe into it <iver>
um so i mean basic <vocnois> my opinion on that is just leav it up to them <vocnois> i mean if thei wanna take the risk obvious thei know <laugh> <iver>
the risk and what goe into it <vocnois> and like i said i mean it doesn't realli hurt anyon the high part of it <iver>
um i mean basic all thei do is sit on the couch and <laugh> and smile and laugh at basic anyth that's said for four or five hour <iver>
and i mean that's about it but 
<vocnois> no i mean <vocnois-it's_noth_crazi> where thei <vocnois-think_thei're> god and <iver>
<he-um> <iver>
yeah on of <ext-my> <sil> uh <sil> friend cousin went <vocnois-to> that fratern <sil> <nois> um <vocnois> <ext-i> <sil> don't rememb what the caus wa of hi <vocnois-death> <sil> um <sil> but i mean like said i mean that definit <vocnois-it's> a danger drug to be us <vocnois> and <sil> i mean not <vocnois-to_sai> that thei should <vocnois-legal> it or <vocnois-anyth> i mean obvious <sil> that's pretti extrem to do <vocnois> <he-but> <sil> like i <vocnois-said> i mean it's someth <ext-more> to where <vocnois-peopl> should know the risk of it <vocnois> and know what goe <vocnois-into> it <vocnois> i mean it's sorta like if you saw <ext-someth> <sil> lai on the street and you <vocnois-decid_to> <sil> eat it or whatev <iver>
i <he-mean> <sil> you don't know <vocnois-anyth> behind it or what's go into it why would you do someth like <vocnois-that> <iver>
um <sil> if you're go to do someth like <vocnois-that> you better at least <laugh-know> <sil> the <vocnois-risk> involv <vocnois-into> it and <ext-what> <sil> exactli you're do <sil> befor you do <vocnois-anyth> like that <iver>
not at all <iver>
<ext-no> <iver>
oh yeah <iver>
<he-i> <sil> i don't think anyon realli <vocnois> affect anyon <cutoff-to=too> <sil> <vocnois-too> much <vocnois> as far as that goe <iver>
yeah <iver>
<nois> <iver>
<nois> <he-um> <iver>
<vocnois> <sil> i don't know <vocnois> <he-um> <sil> like i <vocnois-said> i mean it's someth <sil> i <ext-basic> <sil> see it almost as be the <vocnois-same> thing as like cigarett or whatev <vocnois> <ext-where> <sil> i mean yeah it's bad for you there's a lot of <vocnois-tar> in it thing like <vocnois-that> <vocnois> <he-but> <sil> <vocnois-as> far as <sil> what it <sil> the effect it doe to you it's no wors <vocnois-than_anyth> alcohol can do <vocnois-to> you <vocnois> um <sil> so i <he-mean> <sil> i don't know i mean <sil> i'm not sure if <vocnois-thei_should> actual go so far as to legal it but i don't think it's <ext-realli> <sil> <vocnois-someth> that thei need to realli spend that <vocnois-much_time_try> to control drug <ext-problem> <ext-wise> <vocnois> <vocnois-thing> come in i mean i <ext-know> <sil> i think it's like <vocnois-switzerland> or somewher like <vocnois-that> where thei've legal <ext-drug> <vocnois> and thei basic do it govern <vocnois-base> <vocnois> where <vocnois-the> govern <sil> actual give them out <sil> and the govern get the monei for it <vocnois> um <sil> i can almost see that as <ext-be> <sil> almost a good idea <ext-here> <vocnois> i mean obvious like i said <vocnois-peopl> ar gonna do it <sil> no matter what i mean the same thing <vocnois-with> <ext-gun> <vocnois> if <vocnois-thei> want it thei'll get their hand on it doesn't matter what thei have to do <vocnois-to> it <sil> <ext-thei'll> <sil> thei'll <laugh-come_by_it> <vocnois> <he-um> <vocnois> i mean actual i mean i could see that <sil> thei <ext-could> <vocnois> at <vocnois-least_take> the monei from and put it <ext-to> <vocnois> better <ext-us> of some sort if thei did the <vocnois-same_kinda_thing> <iver>
not realli no <iver>
yeah <iver>
<he-um> <vocnois> it would a littl bit <sil> but at <vocnois-the_same_time> <sil> i mean it wa <vocnois-obvious> a long time ago i mean i don't know how <cutoff-mu=much> <sil> how far in the <vocnois-past> you have to <ext-go> <vocnois> for <vocnois-thing_to> be consid a problem of someth come up again <vocnois> um i mean as long as he's not <sil> didn't have ani <vocnois-histori> of be like an addict <ext-user> <he-or> <vocnois> <vocnois-anyth> like <vocnois-that> <sil> i mean i <sil> i can't <vocnois-sai> it realli bother me <vocnois-too> much <iver>
yeah <iver>
um <vocnois> <he-honestli> <sil> it would <he-be> <vocnois> i'd probabl base <vocnois-the> decis <vocnois-basic> <cutoff-pol=polit> <sil> polit <vocnois> um i can't <vocnois-sai> i'd realli hold that <vocnois-against> him or <vocnois-anyth> <vocnois> obvious <vocnois-it's> not <vocnois-someth> i'd be like oh good well <vocnois-let's> vote for him <vocnois-sinc_he> did that <iver>
but <sil> at <vocnois-the_same> time i don't <vocnois-think> i'd realli hold it against him <iver>
<he-um> i mean <vocnois-obvious> it's someth that <sil> happen <ext-everydai> <he-and> <sil> thing <vocnois-like_that> <vocnois> <he-um> <laugh> like <vocnois-said> by no mean am i <vocnois-sai> yai go presid clinton or anyth <vocnois-like_that> but <vocnois> <he-um> <sil> i mean i can't <vocnois-sai> i'd hold it <vocnois-against> him for do someth like <vocnois-that> i mean <vocnois-it's_noth> that threaten the <vocnois-nation> or whatev <iver>
i mean it's someth he <vocnois-ha> to deal <vocnois-with_he> ha to deal with the problem with him <iver>
<ext-it's> up to him to resolv it <iver>
i mean <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
<vocnois> <he-um> <vocnois> <iver>
i <vocnois-think> <ext-more> <ext-of> <vocnois> along the <ext-line> <he-of> <sil> like physic abus thing like that <vocnois> <he-um> <sil> would <ext-be> probabl <vocnois-cross> the <ext-line> <vocnois> um like if <vocnois-he> got <sil> there were <ext-alleg> <vocnois> <error-alleg=alleg> <sil> uh excus me <vocnois> he wa allegedli beat hi wife or <vocnois-someth> like that <laugh-obvious> then yeah <he-then> <sil> that would caus a problem with <vocnois-me> <he-i'd> <sil> i can't sai that <sil> i would vote for anyon like <vocnois-that> <vocnois> <he-but> <sil> i <he-mean> just like small <vocnois-thing> like <vocnois-that> <sil> <ext-where> it doesn't <ext-realli> <vocnois> <sil> <vocnois-threaten> the <vocnois-nation> or <vocnois-anyth> and i mean it's <ext-someth> <sil> that <ext-happen> <iver>
<sil> i can't realli see a problem <vocnois-with> it <vocnois> um but like i <vocnois-said> i mean <ext-if> he's <laugh-go_around> <vocnois> like <sil> pick fight thing like <vocnois-that> <vocnois> <he-then> <sil> i <he-mean> <sil> i can't sai i'd support anyon like <vocnois-that> <iver>
<vocnois> um <vocnois> i can't sai that'd realli bother me <vocnois> like i said i mean <ext-it's> someth that's hi choic hi opinion what not <vocnois> <he-and> <sil> <nois> <sil> i mean it's up to him it doesn't <sil> affect the <vocnois-nation> <ext-ani> <he-or> <vocnois> <vocnois-anyth> like <vocnois-that> i mean he's still <vocnois> long he's make the right decis or whatev <vocnois> <he-then> <iver>
yeah i mean i can't sai that thei <sil> be ani differ with them <iver>
<he-um> <vocnois> thei did <ext-briefli> like cover <vocnois-thing_like_that_with> like <vocnois> religion and <vocnois-health> class thing <vocnois-like_that> <iver>
um <vocnois> i mean thei didn't realli do <vocnois-anyth> too extens on it thei <nois-basic> as far as religion class go thei basic told what <vocnois-the_cathol> church believ about it <vocnois> <he-and> how thei felt about it but i <nois-mean> thei didn't <ext-realli> <ext-condemn> <he-or> <sil> support it or <vocnois-anyth> like <vocnois-that> i mean <ext-thei> <sil> thei <vocnois-basic> did realiz that it's <he-more> <sil> up to the person i mean <iver>
<vocnois-to> the most part yeah i mean <vocnois-obvious> like <vocnois-thei_said> thei <vocnois-came> out and said <vocnois-the_cathol> <ext-church> <sil> wa <ext-against> <sil> it <sil> but at the same <vocnois-time> <vocnois> like with the research thing like that <ext-where> <sil> thei're sai that it could be a mental disord of some <vocnois-sort> <vocnois> <ext-where> i <ext-mean> <sil> thei couldn't <vocnois-can't_so> much realli condemn it <sil> <vocnois-to> <sil> to the point anymor <vocnois> that <vocnois-thei> us <vocnois-to> <iver>
um <iver>
a few <vocnois-time> that thei did <cutoff-ex=?> <sil> specif <ext-sai> <vocnois> um homosexu <sil> but <sil> i mean there were other <vocnois-thing> that <vocnois-thei'd> cover <vocnois> i mean <vocnois-it's> not like it wa <vocnois-just> an <vocnois> all out <vocnois-assault> on be gai or <vocnois-anyth_like_that> <vocnois> <iver>
<he-um> <sil> i realli did not no <iver>
<he-um> <sil> colleg wise i don't <he-know> <nois> <sil> anyon of colleg <vocnois> ag <vocnois-that's> gai <iver>
i do know a few <ext-peopl> <sil> that ar <ext-gai> <vocnois> um <sil> but <ext-thei're> <vocnois> in their thirti <iver>
or so <iver>
<he-um> <sil> thei <ext-were> peopl i met through friend <sil> um <sil> <ext-actual> <vocnois> <unknown> on of my <ext-friend's> parent <sil> had a friend that wa <ext-gai> <vocnois> um and <sil> just be over there whatev <sil> i mean i can't sai <vocnois> <laugh-i_see_ani> big differ between <iver>
gai peopl or <sil> straight peopl so <iver>
um-hum <iver>
yeah <iver>
<vocnois> <he-um> <vocnois> i would <vocnois-sai> <sil> it doesn't <laugh-realli_matter> either wai honestli <vocnois> i <ext-mean> <vocnois> <vocnois-fact> of the matter is thei <ext-ar> so deal <vocnois-with> it i <ext-mean> <sil> get over it i mean 
<vocnois> obvious it's not someth new that's <sil> been come <laugh-around> i mean it's obvious been around for a long time <iver>
and <sil> i mean <sil> yeah if thei find the caus of it whatev you know that's good but <sil> at the same time it <nois> the caus of it doesn't realli matter <vocnois> i mean the fact of matter is it's there thei have to deal with it so <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
if thei <vocnois> had a wai to cure it then fine <sil> but <vocnois> leav that up to the peopl <iver>
don't sai oh well <vocnois> your son's gonna be gai he's two right now let's <vocnois> you know <vocnois> chang thi so it <vocnois> so it doesn't come out to be a problem or whatev <vocnois> but <sil> i mean i think thei need to leav that to the decis of the peopl <iver>
i mean obvious <vocnois> if <laugh-someon's> <vocnois> like thirti and thei're gai i don't <sil> see them as be too want to chang their entir life basic at that point in time <vocnois> <iver>
um <vocnois> honestli <sil> i can't sai it realli bother me too much <vocnois> um <vocnois> i mean as far as <vocnois> just deal with <vocnois> gai peopl or whatev <vocnois> it <sil> doesn't bother me at all <vocnois> it's just someth <vocnois> i don't wanna <vocnois> deal with or whatnot <vocnois> um so i mean <vocnois> the fact that <vocnois> i mean two <vocnois> peopl of the same sex ar live togeth marri or whatnot <vocnois> that doesn't bother me <vocnois> like i said it's just more someth that <vocnois> i don't know it doe definit make me uncomfort out in public or someth if i see like two gui hold hand or whatnot <vocnois> it's <vocnois> i think it's just more becaus it's so <cutoff-wei=weird> <vocnois> differ than <vocnois> like what you <laugh-normal_see_or> thing like that <iver>
but at the same time i mean i don't <laugh> dislik them or anyth for it i mean <nois-it's> <vocnois> it's their choic i mean <sil> fact of the matter is it doesn't have ani <vocnois> effect or <vocnois> anyth on my life so <iver>
i don't know that's kind of a <vocnois> tricki question realli <vocnois> becaus on on hand <sil> obvious the kid <sil> definit <laugh-will> get <vocnois> uh <vocnois> made fun of and teas and thing like that <iver>
dure school <vocnois> but at the same time <vocnois> i mean as long as <vocnois> the <laugh-parent> love the kid it doesn't realli matter what sex thei ar and thei treat them well <vocnois> um <vocnois> so i mean that's kind of a tough question <vocnois> to answer i mean it's almost <vocnois> it's someth that thei almost need to ask the kid but obvious <sil> at the ag that thei'd be adopt um thei <vocnois> obvious wouldn't know <vocnois> how to answer that question yeah <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
um <vocnois> i can see where <vocnois> the peopl ar come from think that thei might turn them into <vocnois> gai peopl or whatev <vocnois> um just becaus obvious <vocnois> you basic mimic your parent as far as <nois> what you do when you're young and <vocnois> thing like that <sil> and obvious <laugh-if_you_so> <vocnois> had two <vocnois> male parent or whatev <vocnois> obvious you might be think <laugh> more toward <vocnois> like date gui and thing like that <vocnois> um <vocnois> i don't know if that'd be realli a problem though i mean i don't know if that would <vocnois> honestli happen <iver>
um <sil> i mean <ext-fact> of the matter is if be gai is <sil> a genet disord <vocnois> then that should have no effect <sil> on the kid becaus <sil> thei should still be <vocnois> i <vocnois> normal i guess or <he-whatev> <vocnois> you want to sai <iver>
um <vocnois> as far as <vocnois> be heterosexu <vocnois> so i mean i realli can't sai that i'd see that affect the kid's <iver>
sexual at all <iver>
um-hum <sil> <iver>
that wouldn't bother me at all <iver>
um <vocnois> i can't sai that'd <vocnois> realli bother me too much i mean it's <laugh-the_same> thing as <vocnois> have <vocnois> a woman gym teacher or whatev <iver>
um <vocnois> i mean fact of the matter is <sil> a lot of peopl out there <vocnois> i guess <vocnois> could be child molest or whatev i mean it <laugh-doesn't_matter> if thei're straight or gai or <vocnois> whatev <vocnois> the fact of the matter is i mean thei're <sil> thei're out there <iver>
and anyon you come across could be <laugh> <vocnois> get <vocnois> i don't know i guess <vocnois> weird idea of your kid or whatev <iver>
i wa in the cub scout <iver>
so that wa like <nois> through like sixth or seventh grade or someth like that <nois-yeah> <iver>
yeah <iver>
um <vocnois> i don't think that realli matter honestli <vocnois> um <vocnois> <laugh-i_mean_it's> <vocnois> i mean by the time you get into the boi scout you're usual <vocnois> eighth grade or someth like that seventh eighth grade and up <vocnois> and i think by <laugh-that> time <sil> most kid have at least a gener idea of who thei ar <vocnois> and what thei <laugh-like> and don't like <vocnois> um i can't see <sil> i can't see them actual look at like <vocnois> uh their <vocnois> leader or whatev as be too much of a role model figur anymor <vocnois> um i mean obvious it should be someon that thei <nois-respect> <vocnois> but i can't sai that thei'd be like oh well he doe it so <vocnois> i'm gonna have to do it too or whatev <iver>
um hum <iver>
yeah <iver>
um-hum <iver>
realli <iver>
i <cutoff-d=didn't> <iver>
didn't hear about that <iver>
um <sil> i would agre that i <ext-think> <vocnois> regardless of your race you should be abl to adopt <sil> a child i mean <vocnois> just <ext-becaus> <vocnois> you're a black kid live with like a white famili doesn't mean <vocnois> you can't still have your heritag or whatev to be proud of <vocnois> i mean it's the same <laugh-thing> with like <sil> irish peopl adopt like italian babi or someth like that i mean it's no differ <vocnois> i mean <sil> as long as basic you know your root and where you came from i mean i can't see it be a problem of ani sort <vocnois> um i mean just as long as thei have someon that <sil> care for the kid and <vocnois> doe stuff for them i mean <sil> i can't see it be ani <iver>
um <vocnois> there weren't a lot but uh there were definit <sil> some there at least i mean <iver>
um <sil> eh about the same number <iver>
um-hum <iver>
<laugh> <iver>
yeah <iver>

<sil> i think <sil> peopl ar still fairli racist i don't think it's near as bad as it wa but at the same time <sil> i mean i can't sai i blame the white commun so much for it <sil> i would sai it's probabl both <sil> the white and <sil> i guess <sil> ani other race relat's fault <vocnois> um <sil> i mean as far as like if you look at the black commun thing like that <vocnois> you have like b e t <sil> um <sil> you have like the unit negro colleg fund thing like that <sil> where <sil> thei're almost segreg themselv by have these organ <sil> becaus thei're gear specif toward black peopl <sil> and <sil> i think in a wai that's almost segreg themselv from the rest of the commun <sil> becaus thei're not give out equal opportun to the peopl that need em <sil> um it's sort of like the same thing white peopl were do <sil> you know thirti forti year ago <sil> where that thei had thei're <vocnois> white organ or what not <sil> um and i think it's sort of go along the same line where <sil> there is still a problem of it but <sil> i think it ha gotten better at least <sil> if noth els <iver>
um <iver>
i think <iver>
i think for the most part peopl could handl it <sil> um <vocnois> obvious i think probabl more <vocnois> <sil> the <sil> older gener would be the on that would have the bigger problem with it the on that grew up like dure the whole <sil> black right movement and thing like that <vocnois> um i could see them have a problem with it but i mean more <sil> like <sil> more the gener of todai or whatev <sil> like basic anyon under the ag of about <sil> forti or fifti or so <vocnois> i think that thei could probabl deal with it i mean i don't think it caus ani <sil> huge problem or anyth like that <iver>
uh yeah <sil> um <sil> ye <sil> and no thei're kind of weird <sil> like <sil> that um <sil> on set of grandpar <sil> realli i can't hear ever sai anyth <sil> there's a set on the other side that <sil> thei ar <sil> a littl bit more racist <sil> um <sil> but at the same <sil> time <sil> it i <sil> don't know thei almost set up like a doubl standard <sil> for black <sil> peopl <sil> there ar black peopl that thei realli like and i mean thei're actual friend with some black peopl and there ar black peopl that thei don't like for whatev the reason mai be <sil> and <sil> those ar the peopl that thei're racist toward <sil> i mean it's the same thing that goe with <sil> white peopl obvious there ar white you can stand thei're white peopl that ar just <sil> obnoxi and you don't wanna deal with <sil> um i mean it's basic the same <sil> thing <sil> right <sil> yeah <sil> yeah <sil> yeah <sil> yeah exactli <sil> um <sil> i realli don't think we do for the most part <sil> i can't sai i <sil> see ani <sil> real big problem or anyth like that <sil> that occur just <sil> becaus of <sil> the sex <sil> you ar or anyth <sil> i think that probabl would've caus a bigger problem than the black <sil> presid <sil> um honestli <sil> um <sil> although i don't realli <sil> see too <sil> mani sexist <sil> problem i definit do see <sil> gui still be more <sil> like the decis make <sil> type <sil> and as be like the final <sil> sai in thing <vocnois> rather than women <sil> and i would see them <sil> have an author figur <sil> that's be a woman <sil> as caus problem to em <iver>
i think thei would a bigger problem with it yeah <iver>
um <sil> like i said it'd just be the old gener with the <sil> black presid <vocnois> where now it'd be <sil> part of all gener that would still have a problem with it and i think that'd be a bigger number <iver>
then <sil> would be with a black presid <sil> and i think it would caus problem <vocnois> um i don't know if anyth real violent or anyth would occur from it <sil> but <sil> i definit could see here <vocnois> definit <vocnois> <sil> would think that peopl would be <sil> argu about it yell about it and <sil> make a bigger deal about it <iver>
um <vocnois> probabl for the most part i mean <sil> as long as thei <laugh> have a <vocnois> polit background of some sort i can't sai i see ani <sil> real differ <sil> i mean for the most part thei've proven to be abl to do <sil> anyth els ani <sil> gui can do so <iver>
um-hum <iver>
no <vocnois> i <sil> not realli <laugh> i mean <vocnois> i don't think thei'd come <sil> to ani more difficult conclus than gui had <sil> come up to <iver>
uh yeah <sil> no not <sil> at all <sil> no <sil> um honestli no <sil> i'm <sil> pretti shy for <vocnois> the most <sil> part so <sil> those <sil> more type of women i can't sai <sil> i <sil> realli <sil> ever had a relat with or whatev <sil> unfortun although i don't like it <sil> yeah <sil> i don't know i just <sil> i'm a pretti indecis person i don't like make decis <sil> and she's kind of the same wai <sil> so when it come to what we're go to do or whatev it <sil> take <sil> us hour to decid <sil> what we're go to do and i mean it just get us <sil> nowher <sil> i mean even some place <sil> as simpl as you know where to go out to eat or whatev we'll spend a good half hour forti <sil> five minut just drive around till we actual decid a place or someon <sil> sai someth or <sil> whatev <sil> so <iver>
what's that <iver>
um i met her in high school <sil> she's still in high school and i'm in colleg <sil> so <iver>
um <sil> ye and no <sil> i mean <sil> as far as <sil> the experi goe i mean i don't live on campu <sil> so i don't get the entir <sil> colleg experi you know <sil> the whole dorm and event go place on campu <sil> it's more thing about pick and choos that i wanna do on campu i come down for <sil> um so i can't realli sai it's anyth too drastic <sil> i mean obvious it's kind of weird when <sil> peopl ar ask what you're do and you're like oh i'm go to <sil> you know high school prom <laugh-or> someth <vocnois> i have part a littl <sil> littl awkward but i mean i can't sai it <sil> it's realli ani differ or anyth um-hum <sil> um-hum <iver>
i <sil> honestli don't think that that realli ha much to do with it <sil> obvious it doe <sil> put the idea in the kid' head <sil> but <sil> it's been there for a long <sil> time <iver>
um <nois> i mean obvious i mean that's how littl boi ar or whatev <iver>
i mean obvious <sil> be <vocnois> uh be a littl boi i rememb <sil> i mean just <sil> see even thing like footbal or whatev i mean <sil> it's you'd see someth you thought it wa neat so you'd do it or whatev <iver>
i mean it goe back <sil> more toward the curiou natur of <sil> kid <sil> where i mean i can't sai there's anyth realli differ  
whether <vocnois> thei're plai a video game where <vocnois> thei're shoot peopl <sil> i can't sai thei <sil> see that as be someth that affect them <vocnois> <iver>
onc thei turn into adulthood and <sil> thei feel like go out and shoot peopl or anyth like that i don't think that <sil> ha anyth to do with it <iver>
no i mean <sil> like said i think littl kid ar <cutoff-r=realli?> gonna be littl kid if that stuff wasn't on tv thei're still gonna act the same wai <vocnois> thei're still gonna be <sil> walk around with toi gun thing like that <vocnois> plai war or whatev <vocnois> <iver>
um <vocnois> i think it's probabl <vocnois> some of both <vocnois> i think it's probabl more <vocnois> but <sil> i mean <ext-obvious> <vocnois> <sil> thei ar gonna have differ view on how thing work <vocnois> um <vocnois> <sil> but i mean for the most part <sil> i can't see that as <sil> be too big of a problem <vocnois> um <sil> <vocnois> obvious there ar more like violent gui out there and thing like that then there ar women <vocnois> but at the same time <sil> i wouldn't sai there's anyth too <sil> over power as far's the <sil> the number of gui be out there <vocnois> ar violent i mean it's someth <sil> that <sil> unfortun doe happen but i mean <ext-it's> <sil> more how you're brought up whether you can control it or not <vocnois> <sil> <iver>
all right
