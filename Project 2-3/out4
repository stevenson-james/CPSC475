sil noise iver okay iver vocnoise iver um sil im excludename vocnoise sil extive lived 
in columbus my entire life thirty four years vocnoise um born and raised on the 
west side of columbus vocnoise um sil iver sil um im a um vocnoise sil 
its kind of a unique position hesi i guess im a um sil my vocnoise 
job title is a senior research associate sil um vocnoise sil i received my um 
bachelors masters p h d and nurse practitioner all from here from o s u 
vocnoise and im working down at dodd hall in a research position im also a 
nurse practitioner down there that sil um sil sees patients in follow up and in 
clinic vocnoise um they sort of created the position for me vocnoise about a year 
ago after i had my little boy iver um vocnoise working on three different sil 
um sil research projects with three different physicians vocnoise two are cutoffl sil um sil 
specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at long term outcomes in people that 
have sustained traumatic brain injuries vocnoise the other one is a drug study vocnoise um 
looking at control of agitation vocnoise and the other one is a um spinal cord 
injury vocnoise research study iver its exta vocnoise no its a uh vocnoise clinical study 
where were seeing how treadmill training vocnoise effects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury 
iver so theyre kind of spread out twenty five twenty five ten percent thats kind 
of how its divided out vocnoise between the projects iver umhum iver um iver a 
nurse practitioner has more authority i guess to diagnose and see patients sil um the 
state of ohio is vocnoise i think the only state that has a given vocnoise 
um sil nurse practitioners prescriptive authority where we can write our own prescriptions vocnoise so 
we can see patients do the physicals vocnoise we can hesuh suggest medications i guess 
per se but then the physician has to come in confirm our findings and then 
he actually writes the prescriptions iver yes vocnoise and thats what i like iver correct 
iver exactly iver exactly iver but sil were working on it weve gotta couple house 
bills in right now and vocnoise see how things go iver be exciting iver yes 
iver i love ohio state but i dont hesi i guess from a career perspective 
they say its not a good idea to get all your degrees from one place 
but iver i dont intend to ever leave here so iver i love laughit laugh 
iver yes iver yes iver yes vocnoise i uh sil um sil uh vocnoise lordy 
vocnoise um vocnoise grew up on the westside i went to excludename my husband went 
to excludename um sil proximity wise is probably within a mile of each other we 
were kind of high school sweethearts and vocnoise the whole bit sil um vocnoise his 
dad still lives in grove city my mom lives still sil at our old family 
house there on the westside vocnoise and we moved sil um sil also on the 
westside probably couple miles from my mom iver no iver no iver no iver for 
me personally sil um sil family being close sil uh both sides of the family 
are here vocnoise um sil for me familiar vocnoise hesfamiliarity i dont like a lot 
of change a lot of new things vocnoise um sil vocnoise for me hesuh sil 
i was involved in i i swam for o s u swimming an got real 
involved with the o s u sports an just the sporting programs an vocnoise i 
love ohio state football sil so i i like the sports vocnoise there a lot 
of activities to do to now with my little boy sil going to cosi and 
the zoo and sil just knowing where things are and how to get around iver 
so family sil um sil familiarity and sil um sil just the community i think 
sil crime sil i think its going sil extup and up vocnoise sil um sil 
traffic is laughhorrendous vocnoise but the one cutoffdto but i mean vocnoise you need to 
go through that sil right now sil because columbus is expanding so much that we 
need the vocnoise orange brailles sil and um vocnoise i guess the lack of publicity 
nationally i vocnoise i we dont have yknow like the national football teams and vocnoise 
sil now with the hockey coming i hesi think were getting more recognition but sil 
when people talk about columbus they then sil i dont think they know sil columbus 
ohio or columbus georgia or columbus vocnoise vocnoise where vocnoise right iver right iver hesi 
have iver right iver i dont sil know that much about it to be quite 
honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing 
with sil um sil chief jackson and the whole um sil mayoral candidates how theyre 
getting in debates over that vocnoise an i know this is something new on top 
of that um vocnoise i know it was the front page on sundays paper vocnoise 
i looked at it briefly um vocnoise i think there must be some truth to 
it i dont know sil the extent iver oh its possible but i cant imagine 
it would sil unknownuhi sil not knowing how big its going to get i guess 
i cant imagine vocnoise iver that its going to sil well it might make national 
news i just iver it was on national news sil you see im sil not 
that informed on that um vocnoise iver theres so much negativity on the national news 
i dont know if thatll just be blended in or if people will sil associate 
that with columbus iver right iver uh iver two and a half iver yes iver 
yes iver cosis going to be opening up on the sixth um sil looking forward 
to doing that we had a um vocnoise uh seasons pass to wyandotte lake spent 
a lot of time at the pools vocnoise um vocnoise different swim centers hunter sil 
different rec centers the y programs are excellent even here at ohio state theyve got 
the um vocnoise um sil vocnoise recreational sports on sunday afternoons where they can go 
vocnoise um sil we go to the zoo a lot sil libraries have story times 
reading hours those type of things vocnoise um sil just vocnoise all kind of community 
things easter egg hunts at the rec centers iver um iver yeah iver um sil 
up until sil march he was at home with my aunt with family watching him 
in our home vocnoise an then my grandfather whos ninety five got vocnoise um sil 
ill sil and my aunt had to choose between sil my son and my grandfather 
and vocnoise um sil shes watching sil actually my grandfathers doing quite well now but 
she vocnoise um sil watched him so we vocnoise now have him sil in a 
day care vocnoise um sil vocnoise in hilliard iver oh sil definitely laugh iver definitely 
iver i think it was more just a family preference i i preferred family um 
vocnoise again with the news vocnoise reports with uh um different bombings and the sil 
i think the jewish school sil caught my attention vocnoise and now that he is 
in daycare sil i mean we did a pretty good screening but you still always 
kind of sil wonder whats going on vocnoise hes done quite well hes i mean 
hes learned how to use scissors how to color hes vocnoise socially learning how to 
play with other kids those were all things he wasnt sil doing at home sil 
potty trainings been a big deal because all the other kids in class are doing 
it and iver umhum iver yes sil iver yes iver vocnoise he talks about biting 
even though hes never bit sil and um vocnoise theres one particular boy right now 
when sil his family leaves he just has complete temper tantrums and hes tried that 
out a few times too sil hes one you can leave and vocnoise it doesnt 
phase him hes very comfortable with other people but vocnoise like last month or so 
hes tried that a few times and i think he picked that up at day 
care sil seeing the other kids do that iver hesits quite possible vocnoise but we 
cutoffpickpicked sil the day care that i thought was closest to vocnoise well vocnoise the 
one that was laughopenthat had the closest values that we had sil um vocnoise i 
sil personally would like a church based program but uh there arent sil any sil 
well there werent any open when we were looking for one vocnoise um sil we 
did have the option of going here to o s u to their day care 
vocnoise and sil it has a wonderful reputation an everybody that ive talked to that 
has had children there sil is very pleased with the program vocnoise but what i 
didnt like was sil so that if they werent vocnoise um vocnoise imparting values on 
the children vocnoise they dont celebrate sil any holidays at all extso they just kind 
of ignore vocnoise everything vocnoise where sil he is now i still like getting my 
mothers day card in vocnoise i mean theyre doing trick or treat thing on thursday 
theyre going door to door they get to dress up or sil he wouldnt have 
gotten any of that sil at o s u and there pros and cons to 
vocnoise to both of those but iver i guess almost at o s u i 
wish they would vocnoise celebrate every holiday so then theyre exposed to sil all of 
it instead of none of it iver right iver do kwaanza do chanukah do so 
that they can learn other cultures and the other values sil but they just sil 
dont sil do any of them iver yes sil vocnoise iver vocnoise iver umhum iver 
right iver i think its important to know what the persons values an customs are 
and to support whatever it is an if vocnoise i mean weve done some wild 
things over there but i mean its vocnoise i mean weve changed rooms around beds 
around positions of how vocnoise beds needed to be placed in order that they needed 
uh vocnoise face the north star or uh they needed to have vocnoise this thing 
above the bed or under the bed and vocnoise i mean if its important for 
them to sil have prayer then i think its important to get the appropriate people 
over and encourage them to sil have whatever it is they need vocnoise iver i 
dont think forcing prayer on somebody if they dont believe in it i dont think 
thats sil the right thing to do but iver sil i would have a hard 
time believing laughthat laugh vocnoise sil i mean if the person sil knew sil i 
would think if the person knew that people were praying for them at church and 
that was important to them and they sil prayed and iver i i uh sil 
i would find that hard to believe laugh iver personally iver ive heard some of 
them talk about it iver yes iver none of it i mean its kind of 
the traditional light at the um vocnoise uh uh like a big tunnel with a 
bright light at the end or uh vocnoise they were floating above themselves looking down 
at themselves at the accident scene uh sil um sil seeing a dead relative sil 
something like that iver i believe them laugh i do i i i sil extits 
i mean its a very personal sil thing and if thats what they saw vocnoise 
most of my patients are head traumas so vocnoise they can come up with some 
pretty vocnoise wild stories but sil those visions are usually pretty clear and iver i 
dont argue with em i dont debate it its just like sil it might iver 
no sil iver right vocnoise no iver definitely and it really makes you aware of 
your own mortality i mean things you see every day i mean never know it 
can happen to anybody anytime vocnoise just like that accident yesterday with um sil right 
iver i mean you just never know sil how freaky vocnoise iver sil its just 
weird iver right iver my father died when i was two so i think just 
being raised yknow by a single sil parent vocnoise iver sil made you well aware 
of iver um hum iver yes iver uh his mother died um the week after 
we got married vocnoise she had diabetes um sil uh juvenile diabetes diagnosed at age 
eleven and just vocnoise over the years um ended up having open heart surgery and 
vocnoise sil didnt make it through the surgery sil my grandmother also died during open 
heart surgery so vocnoise my perception of open heart surgery even though im a nurse 
laugh laughis not very good just because of sil the two iver family experiences iver 
nothings coming to mind vocnoise no iver oh wow iver iver no sil every once 
in awhile with my grandmother vocnoise she sil always wanted me to become a nurse 
and i was a senior in high school when she died and vocnoise sometimes i 
think boy sil she really like it that i was a nurse vocnoise because i 
still use her bloodpressure cuff an everything she had given me her bloodpressure cuff i 
mean its very old vocnoise iver mmhmm iver sil yes iver sil no iver in 
germany iver sil mmhmm sil iver sil during the depression my grandfather sil um moved 
over here and then sil asked her iver to marry him and she moved over 
and iver sil they settled in springfield ohio and vocnoise then my mom sil met 
my father sil um sil he was from pataskala they met here at o s 
u where theyre going to college and sil they settled here in columbus iver okay 
laugh vocnoise small world laugh iver must have iver yes iver so i think iver 
thats what i sil noise recall missing sil iver vocnoise i know vocnoisesteve vocnoise my 
sil sometimes sil vocnoise i mean unknown weve taken joey out to the cemetery a 
few times to vocnoise sil go to the gravesite of his father and he says 
yknow very often vocnoise sil boy she would really liked to have been here sil 
and done things with him sil iver hes an aeronautical engineer sil um sil vocnoise 
he started off here in columbus at janitrol they went out of business then he 
went to urbana vocnoise sil for grimes aerospace extand um they ended up merging in 
vocnoise sil now theres really no aerospace things in sil columbus extohio extso hes working 
for excludename in plane city which is um vocnoise sil uh sil kind heating and 
cooling air conditioning systems vocnoise sil and so hes using his airflow design iver vocnoise 
not on airplanes but on sil heating and cooling systems iver extyes iver yes iver 
theres a huge wind tunnel yeah iver laugh iver i dont know if its where 
it is but i definitely remember him talking about doing different experiments and projects in 
the tunnel iver vocnoise sil heswe extwell vocnoise sort of and kind of yes we 
were i mean vocnoise extwe dated in high extschool but he ended up going to 
prom with somebody else and we hesi mean vocnoise we vocnoise we went to cutoffkikindergaten 
vocnoise unknown went kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were 
the same age and my mom an his mom were campfire leaders together and the 
whole bit vocnoise and then we didnt really extdate sil and um sil extcollege vocnoise 
kind of sil really didnt get together at all freshman year sil he did go 
vocnoise to school here vocnoise and then um sil as i said i swam for 
ohio state and then i went into agler davidson a sporting goods store to um 
vocnoise buy a swimsuit sil my sophomore year vocnoise and he was a cashier there 
vocnoise iver and we started noisetalking again and it was just like sil we hadnt 
missed any time and started dating iver sophomore year again and ended up getting married 
after i finished my masters iver eighty eight sil vocnoise so we cutoffjujust we just 
had our eleventh wedding anniversary sil yeah iver i extcant laughimagine extimagine laughnot laughdoing it 
that way vocnoise i mean personally i i sil i vocnoise i dont know sil 
vocnoise theres so much sil i know about him and things i trust because ive 
known sil him forever vocnoise theres so many i dont think people are as honest 
and truthful sil these days sil i dont know sil i would have a hard 
time really getting into a relationship with somebody sil that i met today not sil 
knowing everything about him iver sil why do i think that is um iver vocnoise 
iver vocnoise sil oh vocnoise sil i would say family vocnoise values customs traditions um 
vocnoise sil divorce moving vocnoise just looking at my sister my my sister vocnoise sil 
i mean sil shes very happily married but vocnoise sil my god i mean they 
sil they lived here in columbus hes from dallas vocnoise sil they met here sil 
they moved to indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back 
vocnoise sil now theyre in london england theyve been married what four five years vocnoise 
and i think theyve lived six different places vocnoise theyre just constantly on the extmove 
they just dont vocnoise sil have the connection with the family extand vocnoise sil and 
i dont know if thats a bad thing vocnoise sil its just vocnoise sil they 
arent iver sil right and and you arent sil as close to your family and 
vocnoise the traditions and the vocnoise sil and i think you lose all of that 
and then you get so wrapped up in work and moving that vocnoise sil i 
dont think kids have the center base to the family that they used to have 
and vocnoise sil i dont know sil the the culture is just so fast paced 
that vocnoise sil vocnoise i dont noisethink noisepeople are maybe its not honesty maybe its 
just sil vocnoise they dont have as sil much time to get attached extand theyre 
ready to move on again you just dont get as close sil to people as 
you used to iver yeah laugh iver right iver right iver vocnoise i can laugharguebothsides 
of that vocnoise im at a luxury i guess where were at a position where 
sil i i truly dont have to work so vocnoise if i ever felt that 
sil he was in jeopardy or he wasnt getting what he wanted sil or needed 
sil i would sil quit in a heartbeat to to hesto take care of that 
but vocnoise sil having family with him the first sil year and a half sil 
um sil vocnoise sil i dont know i got all my schooling everything out of 
the way vocnoise sil i cut down to the sixty percent when he was born 
to have more time with him vocnoise sil um sil i dont know its a 
whole different society with emails and the vocnoise extuh computer and the internet and cutoffjuthe 
the cell phones i mean its vocnoise in some sil regards its much more connected 
but sil so impersonal vocnoise sil and sil vocnoise sil i think vocnoise sil i 
dont know sil moms being outside the home vocnoise sil i think so many families 
are sil forced to do that with the cost vocnoise sil and is it the 
cost or is it the wants vocnoise sil hesits the very material society right now 
sil vocnoise but its also a very vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise good economical time 
too the stock market vocnoise sil overalls been up i know its down right now 
but overall vocnoise so the moneys been flying extand houses and buildings and iver right 
sil i mean pal is sil booming vocnoise sil it uh vocnoise sil and i 
think sil vocnoise sil personally i could not have put him in daycare when he 
was an infant and i think i would have quit if sil a family sil 
would not have been available but since family was available vocnoise sil and i think 
hes very social i think he was ready for sil the interaction with the other 
kids sil and three days a week isnt sil right iver right sil my husband 
drops him off and i pick him up so hes there for the shortest amount 
of time iver vocnoise extoh laugh iver its probably family by family i mean that 
we vocnoise sil laugh thats why i was a little bit late leaving vocnoise sil 
work the way it was there cutoffthetheyre weve got two sil coworkers one vocnoise sil 
um has her child at hesthe same day care as as myself shes about a 
year now and vocnoise sil and listening to her and vocnoise sil i mean sil 
shes there you know sixty seventy hours a week vocnoise i mean sil she sil 
dropped off at six a m and not picked up till six thirty p m 
and vocnoise sil shes fine with that sil me personally sil theres no way because 
somebody is totally sil in my opinion sil raising that child you arent getting to 
put your values your traditions sil whats important to you vocnoise sil onto that child 
sil now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been 
in day care now for three weeks and vocnoise sil vocnoise shes gonna go vocnoise 
sil shes shes gonna quit her job and go to um sil vocnoise sil um 
sil night working nights three days a week vocnoise sil because sil it is important 
to her to sil be at home with him iver um sil hum iver umhum 
iver um iver right iver right iver right iver vocnoiseright iver its awful laugh iver 
probably vocnoise i mean i just even notice sil like road rage just in general 
like with myself vocnoise when i was working full time even with my child at 
home vocnoise sil just the frustration of getting home i was so stressed with work 
vocnoise sil and now being part time iver im so much more relaxed i mean 
vocnoise the pressures that these kids vocnoise these days have on them vocnoise and youre 
right without families at home to give them the guidance vocnoise sil i mean at 
columbine if im not mistaken that was the one who had the journal who had 
vocnoise somebody had made bombs in the garage and vocnoise the family didnt know about 
it and i was like vocnoise how can a family not know that vocnoise but 
if theyre so busy and working and trying to provide vocnoise sil vocnoise vocnoisesure iver 
right iver wow vocnoise um sil vocnoise i dont know if there could be vocnoise 
there are certain programs different community based programs getting vocnoise but again those are my 
values as i say vocnoise steering the kids into vocnoise a church based program if 
they vocnoisecant be there vocnoise putting them with um sil families and friends that you 
know and trust to cutoffllook to look after them giving them vocnoise the guidance vocnoisethey 
need vocnoise the ymca programs are wonderful they give them vocnoise a structured activity to 
do vocnoise sil vocnoise where theyre supervised vocnoise but again vocnoise sil those programs a 
lot of times cost money that the families dont have and it may not be 
their values to put them vocnoise in those type of programs vocnoise iver laugh iver 
sil vocnoise i mean that goes along with my sil vocnoisecustoms and beliefs i mean 
were going to send our child i already know to parochial schools theres no way 
im going to vocnoise send him to a public school vocnoise and even vocnoise my 
vocnoise my husbands a um vocnoise boy scout sil um sil leader vocnoise and just 
listening to the boys there vocnoise cutoffiyhe sil he vocnoise he did a program last 
night on sil respect iver just sil dont talk when other people are talking just 
sil general extthings vocnoise that i extthink you should take sil for granted iver that 
they just sil dont vocnoise have those sil iver theyre just not getting it right 
vocnoise iver umhum iver i want the discipline and i want the religion basis iver 
i want i dont want somebody vocnoise i i want them to be able to 
vocnoise feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can sil 
iver vocnoise iver vocnoise from our friends that have gone sil vocnoise yeah cutoffthethey with 
uh cutofftheir their discipline is expelling vocnoise the child from school vocnoise while theyre expelling 
them vocnoise to a home sil where the parents working sil where theyre just getting 
three days of free play vocnoise i mean pretty much to get in trouble and 
cause more trouble vocnoise they really arent vocnoise learning sil from that vocnoise noise iver 
right iver i do iver i went to public um vocnoise vocnoisekindergarten through sixth sil 
and actually sil i was quite pleased with the program but my mom also had 
me in um vocnoise i dont know its ccd class its a cutoffcathcatholic vocnoise unknown 
its uh monday nights you go and you get the vocnoise um basis of the 
of the church vocnoise and sil that was important to me and then um vocnoise 
i went to vocnoise um parochial school for seventh and eighth grade which was vocnoise 
in my opinion horrendous vocnoise but vocnoise excuse me i think its sil the age 
vocnoise of the children in general yknow the whole sil puberty thing vocnoise sil and 
going into a new school where these kids had been together since kindergarten and trying 
to fit in at that age vocnoise and then i went to parochial cutoffskschool i 
went to excludename vocnoise um vocnoise for highschool and that was a very good experience 
iver uh new extkid the boyfriend extgirlfriend the vocnoise different things they were trying behind 
the building yknow its just the boy girl i mean just vocnoise sil not laughnice 
laugh no iver vocnoise very much so iver um hum iver unknown i do think 
theres some vocnoise and i dont think they probably get exposed to like the different 
walks of life i dont think they probably be exposed to you know vocnoise the 
gay lesbian vocnoise uh sil i think that would probably just be sil blown over 
and vocnoise vocnoisethey didnt go very much in depth you know about sex and your 
sex ed classes were pretty vocnoise but on the other hand for me that was 
fine i dont know vocnoise our friends its have eleven year old thats going to 
public school vocnoise i mean he had vocnoise a vocnoiseparenting class already vocnoise where he 
had to carry around this baby he went we went to a hockey game with 
him vocnoise and here he is with this baby at this hockey game vocnoise sil 
and it was just like at eleven vocnoise iver thats sil awfully young vocnoise but 
again hes got this baby vocnoise yet they didnt talk about vocnoise how this baby 
vocnoise how you make a baby vocnoise or vocnoise everything cutoffassocassociated sil and i dont 
know if they should be talking about that yet but here he is with this 
baby and its just like sil okay vocnoise iver they do offer sex ed but 
its vocnoise you know sil very um sil scientific in nature vocnoise and then we 
did have a um sil vocnoise think it was actually in religion class where they 
paired you up you were a sil couple and vocnoise you had to go through 
budgets and vocnoise chores and it was more that type of task iver right iver 
right iver mm yeah iver right iver vocnoise i dont know thats so controversial i 
mean vocnoise i mean to the point i mean sil they show them how to 
put condoms on bananas in public schools and its like well vocnoise are you promoting 
sex then or cutoffshoushould vocnoise do i cutoffprprotect uh iver you could argue both of 
those too but i vocnoise me personally id say thats just teaching them more than 
what they need to laughknow laugh vocnoise exti vocnoise i think thats a little bit 
too much iver but then again i feel like sometimes im so naive vocnoise i 
mean sil vocnoise a lot of that wasnt introduced yknow i was just like well 
vocnoise should i have known that iver i dont think it hurt me not knowing 
it iver vocnoise um sil oh vocnoise iver i was very naive on that i 
mean vocnoise i mean you see it on the news and you but sil the 
actual relationships extand all uh but again do you need to know that unless it 
pertains to you and then even if it does pertain to you iver right iver 
right iver i think uh sil i didnt know the difference so it didnt affect 
me at all its just sil theyre just another person vocnoise um vocnoise i think 
more uh as im being exposed to patients with the different lifestyles vocnoise sil and 
knowing how to educate their caregivers and what they need vocnoise sil um sil i 
felt somewhat uh ill equipped the first few times but sil um sil knowing what 
the expectations are especially like with spinal cord injury patients and when you go into 
sexuality and teaching them vocnoise after injury vocnoise sil i mean as a nurse you 
need to be able to sil educate them sil i felt pretty laugh iver inadequate 
sil but the uh that was even through nursing school i mean those werent things 
that were discussed sil you go to special conferences to get sil information on that 
iver that would be fine but again uh vocnoise sil i dont sil its just 
another person with a different lifestyle its like theyre theyre theyre the same as me 
its just vocnoise iver i sil think sil they need to educate sil me on 
whats important to them vocnoise and ill sil yknow sil ill honor and respect as 
much as i can vocnoise sil but sil even people within different sil i mean 
sil a catholic isnt a catholic in my opinion i mean vocnoise theres some sil 
old time sil catholics i mean sil like my mom laugh i mean that they 
just are very strict catholics sil and abide by the vocnoise old rules before the 
vatican vocnoise and sil i think theres a new modern sil age of catholics so 
even if you say vocnoise im jewish or im gay or im vocnoise sil african 
american or whatever vocnoise i still think theyre varying sil theyre still a person with 
different needs and wants and vocnoise what their traditions and culture and sil family values 
are are still gonna be very different vocnoise and you need to find out from 
that individual person what it is sil that they need iver no laugh iver uh 
oh yes sil yes iver well just like premarital sex i mean there was no 
way i would ever discuss anything like that ever with her i mean that was 
just something that you didnt iver right you dont iver no no sil no but 
iver okay iver should sil be laugh but is it iver umhum iver umhum iver 
umhum sil taboo yeah iver sure iver sure iver it took us ten years to 
have excludename and i think my mom sil genuinely thought i was doing birth control 
and we werent but you always knew the subtle undertones undertones you sil know is 
she or isnt she it was just like well im not gonna discuss it with 
her because i knew sil that was a no no to her but sil i 
wasnt but sil she didnt need to know laughthat iver it was right iver i 
mean if i would have chosen to do that well sil its my choice sil 
oh god my husbands a lot better at these type of questions cause he was 
methodist and he chose to turn catholic when we got married and his perception of 
the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was exposed to his 
its like sil boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser then 
mine and laugh just teaching him sil to sil be honest and open and being 
able to talk about sex and drugs and vocnoise unknown uh being there and open 
and keeping the lines of communication sil open and vocnoise and then it goes back 
to the family being available and vocnoise sil doing meaningful sil things with the children 
iver that he didnt iver im gonna let him choose i really am i think 
as long i mean i really dont care sil what religion what he is i 
mean with my husband i really didnt care if he turned catholic or not sil 
i do think religion is important sil and whatever that religion is to him and 
that he has sil a place to go to pray vocnoise to be with sil 
his family sil and other people sil i think thats important if he wants to 
sil be catholic great if he doesnt sil thats okay too iver okay iver okay 
iver sil thats number cutoffthrthree vocnoise vocnoisemmhmm laugh sil i have a very general uh 
opposition to this kind of thing vocnoise sil uh no matter where it is anymore 
vocnoise uh my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing vocnoise because 
i see vocnoise the uh cutoffththe total destruction of our center cities vocnoise uh and 
i say when i speak of center cities i dont necessarily mean just sil cities 
the size of columbus errorwuswaswhich errorwizhwhich errorwus is the largest one in the state of 
ohio now vocnoise but im talking places like vocnoise washington courthouse which maybe have fifteen 
thousand vocnoise or um vocnoise uh wadsworth which maybe have eighteen thousand vocnoise uh this 
kinds of thing is being developed on the peripheral of the cities is just totally 
destroying those vocnoise and sil a consequence i feel its breaking our society down to 
the point where vocnoise we dont sil dont know our neighbors at all anymore vocnoise 
the unknownffeeling uh its quite common anymore that if you go three houses down vocnoise 
you have no idea who those folks are how they feel vocnoise what they might 
do for you or you can do for them vocnoise uh sil and that all 
applies to the polaris question as i see it vocnoise and i think also that 
uh cutoffiits its a its a very very major financial vocnoise uh gain for the 
developers who are doing that and its going to vocnoise therefore harm sil uh the 
many many areas unknownthat affected vocnoise sil such as vocnoise north sil cutoffnnorth sil north 
north north north laugh laughwhatsthenameoftheshop vocnoise uh north what sil northland cutofflilike yeah northland i 
cant laughevensaythe sil vocnoise sil okay iver vocnoise iver sil do i think they will 
sil oh yes i think they definitely will i think theres so much heavy vocnoise 
uh political and financial sil well im gonna reverse that statement uh theres so much 
heavy vocnoise financial sil influence upon the political vocnoise uh influence that uh it its 
almost a forgone conclusion vocnoise sil and if it doesnt occur this unknown within this 
year vocnoise and uh there may be another vote in another year or next a 
next election vocnoise but i think that in fact it will go iver sil i 
didnt quite cutoffunderstaunderstand errorhayer hear you vocnoise iver a little but not not nearly like 
she is laughnono iver vocnoise when youre fifty five or sil or is it sixty 
two whatever age theres that age vocnoise limitation and or you vocnoise sil based upon 
age or disability or being out of town vocnoise uh youre allowed vocnoise so but 
routinely weve cutoffdodone sil done the out unknownuhof i mean done the uh vocnoise sil 
absentee vocnoise over the years vocnoise no going back to basic politicians i i i 
think we have cutoffm sil uh i think the vast majority vocnoise uh sil are 
truly sil good sil honest people vocnoise they try to mean well sil im sil 
im concerned always vocnoise that uh people who go into politics are in fine shape 
when they start vocnoise but the tremendous influences are brought to bear vocnoise that they 
never vocnoise had had the opportunity to comprehend vocnoise before they got there vocnoise extand 
theyre just overwhelmed sil it it and i dont necessarily think its a sil its 
a vocnoise a dishonesty vocnoise sil its like a tidal wave they get caught up 
and they cant resist the direction thats being put or they are being pushed vocnoise 
sil umhum vocnoise sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil vocnoise i just had a uh cutoffhhealthy 
healthy vigorous vocnoise conversation last night vocnoise with a township trustee jersey township vocnoise which 
is just over in uh licking county vocnoise and uh sil this gentleman sil is 
sil exteighty three or four years of age and hes been the township trustee various 
times throughout his life vocnoise and sil he sil is very very concerned because of 
the exploding vocnoise unknown back up vocnoise hes vocnoise a farmer has been a farmer 
sil all of his life he owns about a hundred and fifty acres adjacent to 
vocnoise approximately a thousand which his son is cutoffperdopredominantly sil mainly operating unknowni vocnoise yet 
he goes out and works too sil uh helps out at cutoffeighteightty sil at this 
age vocnoise uh sil but he is concerned because theyve just recently passed an ordinance 
within the county vocnoise which allows vocnoise developers to come in and sil already they 
are ready to take over a couple farms that are fairly close to him unknownbutimean 
vocnoise but it affects the whole township vocnoise and one of the things that they 
unknown sil left out as he put it sil one of the ordinances that he 
cutoffhhhe pushed and pushed and pushed vocnoise he wanted sil a specific sil part of 
that sil ordinance to say vocnoise sil every so many sil people that move in 
to this area vocnoise you must provide for sil a school vocnoise and he said 
vocnoise of cutoffconsequenconsequence and then he said they didnt do it sil and he said 
i push and push and he said vocnoise sil i didnt know all the influence 
was on vocnoise on the side to get more houses get more houses because it 
was gonna produce more taxes vocnoise but extthey sil he kept saying well what do 
you want these taxes for if youre not gonna provide for schools sil so he 
was very concerned about that vocnoise so here was a case in my cutoffththinking opinion 
vocnoise a very very honest uh politician vocnoise but he was sil also being extshoved 
away extfrom what he sil felt was an honest approach sil vocnoise noise iver uhhuh 
sil laugh iver let me focus on cutoffwhwhat youre question im not extsure that sil 
i vocnoise that she was answering what i thought cutoffyyou vocnoise but um vocnoise i 
appreciate your opinions vocnoise sil but were you asking sil did you have we seen 
a change in the politicians vocnoise and through our lifetime was that particularly your point 
iver vocnoise sil vocnoise iver yeah sil okay sil vocnoise iver okay unknownidontiidn vocnoise iver 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think 
it will sil also be changing in the future vocnoise uh sil vocnoise going all 
the way back uh finances uh heswere were not a consideration in the in oh 
id say probably my first thirty maybe even forty years vocnoise there was some there 
was influence vocnoise but i think the influence was not financial sil it was influence 
from vocnoise the person who could get up here and talk with a group of 
people vocnoise and sway them with his vocnoise and i want to use the word 
opinion but i know thats not right sil it sil he swayed them with vocnoise 
a position that he had developed sil now thats not necessarily his opinion vocnoise so 
im trying to make a point there laugh laughbut vocnoise he would sway them based 
upon vocnoise the sil influences that he had cutoffhhad vocnoise had cutoffother sil uh sil 
uh various people within his community or sil whether vocnoise whether youre talking about a 
township or a county state whatever vocnoise it may be vocnoise and yes sil uh 
uh then sil cutoffperhapsper sil slowly vocnoise then i think the finances came into play 
vocnoise and finances have come to a cutoffhhorrible sil horrible vocnoise horrible situation as of 
today and ill leave out this vocnoise cutoffthithe vocnoise the last two years it unknownhas 
because its because vocnoise its rather cutoffshspecific sil specific right now vocnoise but uh going 
back to two years or four years ago sil finances were still a very very 
heavy consideration vocnoise and sil not not just on the uh national level sil but 
im seeing it even on local levels vocnoise i know within the immediate community there 
are people out there vocnoise uh sil cutoffttell hey come on well go to dinner 
well go do this and well do this and do this just uh just barely 
barely breaking vocnoise extuh the barrier but not breaking the law vocnoise vocnoise uh sil 
so yes sil very definitely sil progressively sil has changed vocnoise vocnoise vocnoise sil iver 
iver iver iver which one of them laugh vocnoise iver old blue eyes thats right 
laugh vocnoise uhhuh vocnoise iver well sil exti dont know that thats a cause uh 
a it sil extthey they as a extgroup uh sil and this was kind of 
a happenstance it cutoffoccoccurred vocnoise this occurred vocnoise as a result of a very major 
world war vocnoise uh so sil in cutofftterms sil in terms of them causing it 
vocnoise errorthithereit it was there was a happenstance and vocnoise and part of this mass 
communication were talking about vocnoise uh vocnoise began with them vocnoise and yes they are 
a major influence because we were talking about numbers and youre talking about uh vocnoise 
a errorgrezhagreater a greater sil inter communication vocnoise id like to go back one step 
sil where were talking about sil vocnoise when i made mention that three doors down 
you dont even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that 
vocnoise uh i think thats extprofound vocnoise as an sil individual communication we are nearing 
zero vocnoise in terms of global mass communication to everybody cutoffwiwith vocnoise inner personal communications 
thats the key in my opinion vocnoise personal versus inner personal communications vocnoise cutoffehand cutoffand 
and sil its zero over here and were almost a hundred percent over here vocnoise 
but when were in this inner personal or global or massive whichever term is the 
most appropriate vocnoise um sil john doe who speak here vocnoise he hasnt the faintest 
idea who jane doe is over here vocnoise on the personal vocnoise it used to 
be sil that yeah you knew who this person errorrizerightwas over here thats jane doe 
that lives in that third house vocnoise and she married henry jackson dont you remember 
old henry vocnoise well henry was the guy that lived way over there vocnoise on 
the other side of town vocnoise mass communications as it is today sil they havent 
the faintest idea of where jane came from or where henry jackson or where vocnoise 
old cutoffjhjackson sil whoever laughitwaslivedoverthereisaid vocnoise so sil i think uh the cutoffththink i cutoffhhave 
i extthink you cutoffmmust need to distinguish between the personal inner personal sil relationship sil 
so maybe i digress too far there vocnoise sil vocnoise or who the next door 
neighbor is sil vocnoise iver iver sil vocnoise lassie sil laugh sil vocnoise i think 
i could summarize cutoffmmost sil uh just with a few words of what youre meaning 
to say i cutoffmmay sil may be wrong vocnoise but i think youre really meaning 
to say we must get back sil to the family vocnoise there must be two 
parents vocnoise and they must cutoffbbe sil recognize their children and vocnoise do like sil 
you have just discussed vocnoise uh do with them the cutoffsasame vocnoise and sil because 
today we are just drifting and drifting and drifting we uh vocnoise fifty percent of 
uh everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as i 
sil understand the statistics today vocnoise and uh unfortunately its still increasing but there is 
a strong feeling that maybe this is going to slowly reverse or at least decrease 
not reverse probably vocnoise um vocnoise once again we are talking about communications too uh 
and the communications can be ill and they can be great vocnoise sil uh as 
shes touched upon vocnoise sil uh oh but i feel that pendulum has to swing 
back from vocnoise the non family were headed toward or have been headed toward vocnoise 
and get back to a cutoffffamily very basic family orientation vocnoise cutoffiits cutoffiits vocnoise its 
sil abhorrent when i vocnoise hear hesthat uh vocnoise uh sil oh was it seven 
ladies who were quote sil beautiful ladies are now willing to sell exttheir extuh sperm 
uh well thats not their sperm well whatever that is they sell vocnoise uh sil 
for ten thousand dollars apiece and to be implanted in the other vocnoise so that 
they can produce cutoffkquote uh a quote beautiful child vocnoise well a beautiful child uh 
sil and if erroryourveyouve talking about just the physical features vocnoise cutoffiis cutoffiis is meaningless 
sil its what sil is embodied in that body thats sil can be beautiful vocnoise 
instead of just the physical features that you look at vocnoise and that to me 
is abhorrent such a such an extidea vocnoise cutoffjjust and that sil indeed is gonna 
take away from family i cutoffcacant vocnoise in my way of vocnoise thinking i cant 
imagine vocnoise that i would uh sil have my wife producing vocnoise somebody elses child 
over laughhere and im going to have vocnoise the same sil noise sil cutoffffatherly sil 
thank you thats cutoffexaexactly fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward or with that child 
iver yes to but that uh unknown more that has primarily because of necessity vocnoise 
uh more often than not uh sil uh maybe even today its less than that 
vocnoise because its a cutoffbeebeen sil because of a loss of a parent errorthertheor or 
inability of a errorprerntparent vocnoise uh or parents vocnoise uh being able extto handle those 
children vocnoise so sil yes hesthose those things do exist and they will always have 
some sil but thats a very small percentage though scott sil vocnoise iver thats about 
right thats about right laugh sil think its errorintrovitral errorintrovitral unknown iver vocnoise iver vocnoise 
iver iver sil cutoffcrocross errorcocross errortrossercrossdresser cross dressing uhhuh or cross personality sil vocnoise sil 
homosexual sil oh okay gay whatever term sil unknownser sil vocnoise sil aids sil vocnoise 
sil laughno laugh vocnoise sil vocnoise sil iver vocnoise well i see sil im gonna 
have to fall way back and show my age again as most people would say 
vocnoise uh vocnoise i cutoffwwould sil i would really like to see extthis to happen 
but i also know that it most cutoffllikely sil itll never happen within the next 
three or four generations vocnoise sil but i cutoffststill sil vocnoise im of a extguy 
who still believes that the lady has a place in her home vocnoise and i 
do not believe that we need sil a man and wife out working and making 
vocnoise incomes as sil everyone in the united states today feels they must vocnoise uh 
vocnoise hazel hit upon it rather lightly a while ago and was talking about vocnoise 
need versus uh luxuries unknownwell i want i want i want vocnoise well vocnoise i 
uh my judgment is that were spending today probably sil eighty percent vocnoise of uh 
the income sil on things that they vocnoise want sil and only twenty percent on 
what they need and thats all they need to spend on that need vocnoise so 
therefore the cutoffnecnecessary vocnoise pardon iver todays society does describe the need entirely differently than 
what i would vocnoise talking sil talking to this gentleman last night we got back 
and we were comparing uh our cutoffn sil uh uh early life vocnoise uh we 
didnt even know what a nickel or a dime was uh those cutoffthathat that was 
unimportant and we also were talking about vocnoise how uh sil how we uh went 
sil unknown vocnoise he was telling me a little bit about it and i said 
vocnoise let me stop you paul i said paul cutoffwhwhat sil what kind of shoes 
did you wear vocnoise uh in the summer sil he said we didnt wear any 
shoes sil aha vocnoise and then i told him how we didnt either i came 
from a very large family vocnoise uh mostly boys vocnoise we would uh sil take 
our errorshoshoes shoes off as soon as the cutoffearearliest cutoffearearliest as we could in the 
springtime vocnoise we would sil unknowng uh store them in tallow in jars of tallow 
tallow is vocnoise uh lamb lard if laughifyouwanttocallitthat vocnoise and that was a preservative vocnoise 
and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as 
november this year it wouldve been november vocnoise we would take those shoes out and 
depending upon whose foot sil fit those shoes those would the be the person who 
wore them vocnoise it wouldnt be cutoffththe cutofft unknownthe vocnoise the one who had worn 
them in the spring vocnoise cause hes growing in the meantime vocnoise and uh and 
it may go to another another sil and i can remember we passed shoes down 
vocnoise as many as four of we children vocnoise now my dad also repaired shoes 
sil he repaired shoes he cut our hair vocnoise well today that would be the 
most horrible thing is some of the kids that well i need me a pair 
vocnoise of cutoffkw um i dont know whether you want cutoffri uh advertising on here 
or not but its not cutoffaadvertising vocnoise i i want a nike or i want 
a rocky or i want a guess vocnoise uh vocnoise those thats pure luxury no 
needs at all but uh vocnoise todays society vocnoise vocnoise sil extthose are vocnoise sil 
as i errorfinkthink you were implying vocnoise those are extneeds two those people vocnoise but 
they arent sil uh vocnoise so vocnoise sil how do we correct some of this 
youve got to cutoffgget i think weve got to cut out sil a lot of 
this luxury vocnoise weve got to slowly bring quote that family back home vocnoise uh 
vocnoise and i dont necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man 
who cares vocnoise in todays work uh world far less agriculturally related vocnoise uh were 
far more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation vocnoise uh so vocnoise uh a man 
and uh sil uh sil a cutoffmaman or a cutoffwomwoman errormelet me errorfrephraserephrase a woman 
can do sil most of the work thats being done outside of the home vocnoise 
today versus what they sil couldve done vocnoise as agricultural people vocnoise uh sil and 
so once again though that would extbring sil cutoffbback sil people back to this sil 
central noise family vocnoise make up noise sil this vocnoise sil has to be vocnoise 
communications communications as its going uh that its sil irreversible sil uh cutoffaand i think 
it can be redirected in much in the manner shes speaking uh vocnoise and uh 
sil and where does this start i think it has start back here in first 
grade vocnoise i think parents must participate with teachers vocnoise uh as we used to 
sil uh was just common uh you could walk in and sit down and uh 
watch the students or participate with participate and or vocnoise assist sil uh well exttoday 
vocnoise they have these cutoffca assistants sil but theyre hired vocnoise directed vocnoise assistants theyre 
not in there sil portraying or passing vocnoise their sil hesown their values of the 
community to the students sil vocnoise uh so i think thats sil i hesi guess 
i cutoffccontinue cutoffmumust i will continue to come back to family sil to family almost 
everything has got to cutoffbbe come back to family vocnoise bring that family back together 
vocnoise and get them to communicate sil on that vocnoise personal basis not that impersonal 
basis vocnoise iver very very much so now cutoffffifty sil cutoffffifty twenty sil fifty years 
ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would call we would tag vocnoise that 
description vocnoise rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism vocnoise well vocnoise in 
the manner we cutoffdisdescribe define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic 
government uh today were cutoffnno vocnoise no longer a errorcutoffdumademocratic democratic government vocnoise as defined 
back there then uh vocnoise yeah were still democratic according to our new definition of 
this vocnoise developed over time vocnoise uh but its vocnoise far more socialistic vocnoise uh 
but vocnoise iver sil vocnoise iver umhum sil yeah theres almost nobody anymore thats willing 
to do uh just uh miniscule things vocnoise unless youre gonna get paid for it 
uh its just always money money money money money money money money vocnoise uh cutoffbbut 
sil just uh vocnoise vocnoise vocnoise vocnoise laugh vocnoise iver vocnoise vocnoise iver umhum iver 
vocnoise sil iver vocnoise iver iver iver iver umhum vocnoise iver vocnoise oh we now 
run on the gregorian and or that sort of thing vocnoise back to your question 
i think you were asking are iver vocnoise laugh iver laugh iver laugh vocnoise iver 
vocnoise iver yeah thats right when youre that was your question are we gonna have 
doom were gonna have a catastrophe we gonna get this thing turned around before we 
have vocnoise yes sil uh i think we will vocnoise sil uh but i dont 
sil think were ready to turn around yet i think were still vocnoise sil vocnoise 
well this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four five times i 
cutoffththink sil uh it it is coming upon extus extso rapidly vocnoise sil cutoffwwell vocnoise 
sil i vocnoise sil vocnoise strongly predict sil vocnoise sil that in just sil twenty 
years vocnoise sil and possibly ten vocnoise sil each and every one of us in 
the world are gonna be interconnected with one another vocnoise sil but once again its 
an impersonal sil uh inner connection vocnoise sil i can ill be able to contact 
you when youre over in paris and ill be over cutoffihin in in unknownoctey ohio 
and out there on the farm vocnoise sil and i am probably watching the geese 
swimming up and down the little lake vocnoise sil and youre sitting over there in 
paris having a vocnoise sil uh sil noise sil coffee something something vocnoise sil yeah 
it laughdoes laugh iver vocnoise sil well i i enjoy this vocnoise sil vocnoise laugh 
vocnoise but it itll be impersonal extuh because here you are heseh hesoo im cutoffnnot 
i cant face you i dont know whether youre really kidding me in what youre 
laughtalkingabout sitting there in the vocnoise in extthat uh street laughcafeornot sil laugh vocnoise but 
i really do think were gonna be interconnected in that sense and uh um sil 
it it becomes cutoffihimpersonal so much more sil impersonal i guess im very strong about 
the cutoffp term vocnoise personal versus impersonal inner communications vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil vocnoise 
sil extand the extbad that weve talked about i think will be a part of 
that ten and twenty years from now vocnoise sil but i think we will have 
begun by that time to try to clean up the act if you will vocnoise 
sil uh going back to the errorpolipolitical political question i think that financial things who 
i errorthankthink think we will start sil well start slowing that down oh i think 
well have less influence vocnoise uh in the terms of finance and i dont think 
well get back to abraham lincoln days vocnoise sil but uh cutoffwwell if we can 
swing that pendulum back vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise uh i think we vocnoise i 
think we can and i think we will sil vocnoise i think we can do 
the same thing with communications uh sil i think we can vocnoise sil eliminate a 
extlot of the uh bad vocnoise bad influences vocnoise sil i do know that over 
time what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here sort 
of like the definition of need vocnoise sil versus luxury sil vocnoise uh those definitions 
change the definition of socialism democracy that slowly have changed over these times vocnoise well 
the same thing will true sil vocnoise be true with those vocnoise its still functioning 
laugh vocnoise excuse me sil vocnoise um sil and i think we will also sil 
slowly swing that pendulum on back to the sil extand sil to the family again 
vocnoise there are those doomsayer from my point of view are saying that uh sil 
in in many years to come vocnoise there wont be such a thing as a 
family sil uh its just hesyou vocnoise you go out here you meet a vocnoise 
an opposite sex you cutoffprocriprocreate procreate and you go on your way she goes on 
her way vocnoise and shes just as satisfied about going her way as you are 
going your way vocnoise sil um cutoffyeyes yes a lot of that is true sil 
vocnoise but i think that sil uh i think that i dont think thats gonna 
ever happen i think well turn that thing around vocnoise i think this so called 
divorce rate program as i talked about awhile ago that vocnoise uh sil every sil 
well fifty percent of the people who marry within five years vocnoise are no longer 
together i think that will sil will change and that sil is a very significant 
thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family iver vocnoise iver 
now that was up to age eighteen to or there about to sil noise vocnoise 
vocnoise sil vocnoise i think that the vocnoise you said get back to the very 
beginning of the birth and up to kindergarten so forth cutoffwewell vocnoise i thats thats 
the family vocnoise but uh i think that we in our educational program vocnoise sil 
we really need to start teaching uh vocnoise what i call the older values uh 
but but but good values i unknownwontgivenyou whether theyre old or new but good values 
vocnoise sil and i think we really need to have that established within our educational 
system vocnoise uh starting in the elementary right on up to college i think there 
ought to be a number of college uh courses vocnoise uh that that devoted exclusively 
for this so that those students can go back and sil uh sil vocnoise assist 
in teaching vocnoise but i think that many of the courses vocnoise sil vocnoise sil 
other courses ought to have sil elements within them that are teaching value family values 
vocnoise um i could even so go so far as to saying chemistry or botany 
or psychology vocnoise uh any one of those vocnoise those are specialized subject sil vocnoise 
sil and vocnoise sil vocnoise and vocnoise but vocnoise the i think there are elements 
that they can have within each one of those vocnoise talking about family value family 
value vocnoise uh and that will help them vocnoise permeate the entire society sil and 
but its got to start back here in the first and i think vocnoise iver 
vocnoise sil vocnoise just uh extwhy dont i just go back and copy cat something 
she said uh picking up that cutoffbaybaby picking up that child and cuddling it um 
sil and having vocnoise having that baby touch your skin and uh vocnoise and uh 
uh teaching vocnoise sil how what love is vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise sil uh 
you cutoffdo dont necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel 
that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the 
brother little brother and the little sister vocnoise sil all of those vocnoise sil now 
you say vocnoise teach that well my god didnt they know that when they first 
came into this classroom vocnoise sil no not today vocnoise not today vocnoise sil i 
i dare say that uh the vast majority and i mean above fifty well above 
fifty percent when i say that im not being arbitrary vocnoise um sil vocnoise students 
in high school today vocnoise probably havent had their mother or their father vocnoise sil 
truly vocnoise sil hold them and hug them vocnoise rather than just saying hi johnny 
vocnoise bye iver see you tomorrow vocnoise i mean vocnoise sil hold them vocnoise vocnoise 
sil feel the warmth of the body sil uh vocnoise sil hear the conversation quietly 
vocnoise sil rather than uh hearing okay vocnoise time to get out of here you 
know with a vigorous saying vocnoise but with pleasant sort of remark vocnoise these kind 
i can cutoffelaborahelaborate i could write a whole book on that vocnoise on this on 
answer your errorqueersquestions vocnoise uh but its these kinds of things are very elementary really 
vocnoise vocnoise sil theyre very elementary i guess to vocnoise our age group but maybe 
not so sure uh maybe the baby boomers that wouldnt be elementary at all vocnoise 
sil uh vocnoise going back to your question about the baby boomers vocnoise vocnoise sil 
vocnoise i still think they were vocnoise sil i dont think theyre causing them but 
then i think it was a happenstance uh with that group vocnoise with a massive 
group sil vocnoise vocnoise variant iver sil my answer to your question is has this 
eroded im gonna answer with the word using the word respect vocnoise sil uh yes 
i feel that uh sil this has eroded over time vocnoise uh theres not the 
respect for our sil elders i dont vocnoise necessarily mean elders in terms of the 
uh chronological age but im talking in terms of generations vocnoise the uh theres less 
respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and 
the great grandparents vocnoise uh im gonna give you a first hand example vocnoise sil 
i just had a sil uh conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now 
twenty sil vocnoise uh sil she will come over to my house grandpas house vocnoise 
and shell come in and shell flop down in a chair vocnoise uh sil and 
she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it vocnoise uh i 
dont ever sil tell her uh do sil to do things vocnoise and ive pointed 
out to her that whenever we went to visit grandpa vocnoise or great grandfather vocnoise 
uh vocnoise if the if we saw weeds out in the garden we went out 
and we hoed the garden if we if or the chicken house need to be 
cleaned uh vocnoise and they hadnt gotten to it that day we went out and 
cleaned the chicken house we would say vocnoise grandpa is it okay if we go 
out and clean your chicken house well course you knew very well it was gonna 
be okay vocnoise but sil a matter of respect though you ask is it okay 
for us to do it vocnoise and uh sil now with her vocnoise uh sil 
i can have dishes out there in the sink uh that are left there for 
from breakfast maybe sil lunch and vocnoise uh sil she shell walk out there and 
will say vocnoise well grandpa how come your dishes arent done and then she turns 
around walks away vocnoise sil thats right you uh huh sil and and she may 
then go ahead and say vocnoise well now sometimes shell ask and sometimes she doesnt 
but lets assume she did shell ask vocnoise is it alright if i have some 
of this vocnoise she goes ahead and gets the dishes out so forth vocnoise she 
puts them right in there in that sink uh with those other dishes vocnoise makes 
no efforts to clean them sil hesand and sil i sil i sil ive seen 
this in many many many incidents but im giving you this is very first hand 
i know this vocnoise and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing 
in our society today vocnoise so yes in my opinion definitely its eroding i know 
you took a little different approach in answering the question vocnoise uh sil from sil 
over the time that that sil this kind of thing is eroding based upon the 
word respect vocnoise vocnoise sil vocnoise laugh vocnoise sil laugh sil vocnoise she just used 
the word penalty sil extuh vocnoise penalty has errornlots of different definitions each individual has 
a mental picture what the word penalty means vocnoise based upon their own experiences vocnoise 
sil all i wanna take just sil and it say it sil penalty in a 
very general sort of way sil vocnoise whatever your extreme is to the right or 
to the left lets come back to about the middle vocnoise sil im concerned that 
we are getting away from penalties sil completely vocnoise and i feel its absolutely essential 
that we have penalties we have vocnoise for everyone sil for everyone really across the 
board uh we were getting away from penalty were getting away from penalty vocnoise uh 
sil uh so many people i just to give an example vocnoise talking about adults 
vocnoise i just read uh statistics the other day right here errorkah columbus where vocnoise 
uh it was an extremely high percent i cant quote the percentages vocnoise of people 
who uh ignore uh yellow lights and and of consequence they are ending up going 
through red lights vocnoise and there many many many accidents taking place vocnoise uh sil 
i sil and we sil it used to be that you could place uh uh 
an a law enforcement officer the corner if it happened and he immediately he would 
uh vocnoise penalize you by giving your ticket and you face the sil court as 
the case may be vocnoise well now we have passed so many little ordinances and 
laws and change the vocnoise enforcement policies and this kinds of things vocnoise well the 
poor police officer he cant even do that any longer hes got vocnoise if somebody 
uh runs through red light you almost have to hit somebody vocnoise and then be 
accused for going through the red light sil he cant just arbitrarily be there because 
thats called vocnoise extoh i think the word harassment plays a part vocnoise you are 
harassing that individual because you were standing there waiting for him vocnoise to commit this 
problem vocnoise when i sil lets just get away from that example you can talk 
about whether you did you were carrying vocnoise uh sil i dont want to get 
in to the guns and knives and stuff in the school thats enough for sil 
heard about that but vocnoise the same principle applies vocnoise but im talking about just 
every day things uh that uh sil people who if you wanna talk erroratopabout children 
primarily vocnoise uh vocnoise vocnoise there is no penalty any more vocnoise uh parents are 
scared to death uh to pick up one up and spank them um with their 
bare hands or vocnoise or to make them stand in a corner because they considered 
vocnoise and im going back to the word harassment child abuse and harassment vocnoise of 
consequence um vocnoise and a heshard uh and penalty can be a very very simple 
thing a mother can simply vocnoise look at janie and say janie vocnoise you should 
not do that iver and the stern expression or the expression on that face vocnoise 
sil can be sil equally effective as the smack oh on the bottom vocnoise oh 
with the bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be vocnoise i know 
that my the most effective penalty for me was my mother vocnoise uh would uh 
go out vocnoise near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and 
she would smack me across the shoulder vocnoise and yeah it left marks vocnoise but 
hesit and sure it hurt i mean it would sting vocnoise and i understood exactly 
what was meant and i think i grew up and ive ended up being i 
think a quite successful person i think my mother vocnoise had uh vocnoise uh thirteen 
of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty doggone decent kids vocnoise and none 
of us were injured none of us were hurt uh vocnoise and that was a 
basic method of vocnoise penalty vocnoise cutoffihit it wasnt something that vocnoise truly cutoffhurhurt injured 
vocnoise uh vocnoise now today however vocnoise uh i suspect my mom could easily be 
cutoffhahave could have been charged with abuse in fact vocnoise child abuse vocnoise because it 
left a mark across my shoulder where that vocnoise uh vocnoise green cutoffswiswitch its always 
a green switch because uh uh the heseh old ones they would break you didnt 
want them break laughbreak laugh vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise there was just 
something about that sting vocnoise far better far more than a paddle paddle was kind 
of a whop and then was end up with a sting and it kind of 
got your attention sil and then you cutoffrememremembered vocnoise noise vocnoise sil vocnoise appeals appeals 
sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil iver sil mmhmm sil vocnoise iver sil iver 
sil sil iver sil i read and vocnoise iver um hum vocnoise iver vocnoise sil 
vocnoise sil there was an in depth story about that i think it was vocnoise 
i unknowndontknow was harpers magazine or what it was in a vocnoise uh uh errorsaya 
significant magazine where they had uh made a study of the new york situation vocnoise

more company laugh iver vocnoise iver laugh iver yeah sil yeah iver right sil yeah 
iver vocnoise um im sort of in sil upper clintonville vocnoise um iver vocnoise iver 
vocnoise um sil not so much sil um cutoffii sil for vocnoise for fifteen years 
i lived uh down on excludename sil which is more sil vocnoise um sil cutoffllot 
a sil cutoffimim sil lot of artists live there but im amazed that my new 
street sil is full of artists too iver its just yknow sil older laughartists laughmore 
vocnoise sil more established artists vocnoise iver so um sil vocnoise iver no sil no 
sil no iver yeah iver yeah sil lower clintonville iver laugh iver vocnoise laugh laughyeah 
iver vocnoise iver yeah sil unknownm iver yeah sil yeah sil iver vocnoise iver um 
sil uh sil the the the public sil transit system i mean i know theyre 
doing the best they can but i dont see how were ever gonna get out 
of this without light rail sil vocnoise sil and im laughreallybummed iver that that that 
the levy didnt pass sil vocnoise um sil vocnoise sil lets see sil vocnoise sil 
boy sil i sil i dont know sil i mean we got a great airport 
with great connections and cheap flights laugheverywhere sil vocnoise sil thats no thats no drawback 
were not isolated sil vocnoise sil um sil noise sil boy i dont i iver 
laugh iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver yeah sil um and sil cutoffthithis sil this is 
something ive thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where 
its very sil vocnoise conservative sil yknow not real open to new things vocnoise or 
if i had stayed on the east coast where of course itd be really competitive 
sil vocnoise sil i sil i probably wouldnt be sil working as a freelancer today 
vocnoise i came to columbus there wasnt sil yknow there wasnt much going on when 
i came here iver vocnoise sil and uh yknow its sil oh weve got art 
sil vocnoise were open to that sil yknow iver yknow theres not a big established 
gallery system and everything so a lot of things were just available sil yknow sil 
vocnoise sil just sil could walk in and show anywhere sil and um sil vocnoise 
and so i yknow i met a lot of people doing that sil and its 
cutoffd sil vocnoise i mean im cutoffststill mainly friends with sil the same people i 
met then yknow cutoffpepeople cutoffmmy sil cutoffmmy sil artists my age but um sil vocnoise 
sil its been sil and theres yknow i vocnoise sil i dont belong to any 
formal sil groups in columbus sil but sil um vocnoise its a cutoffrreal its a 
real strong network of people yknow everybody cutoffnknows sil knows sil everybody iver yknow so 
its uh yknow if cutoffyoyou if you have a problem if you wanna talk to 
somebody vocnoise well if if somebody you know personally doesnt they know somebody iver who 
can cutoffs who can help you with that so iver um sil i have work 
in uh p m gallery in the short north iver and also at the show 
of hands sil galleries sil and iver yeah iver yeah ellen at lane avenue has 
been a big booster of my work i mean sil i was really lucky sil 
laughtorun across her iver um they try to limit the the cutoffs iver the sil 
uh sil i said i didnt belong to any groups and thats not true i 
belong to ohio designer craftsmen vocnoise and um vocnoise uh they cutofftrtry sil in the 
in the shops they try to limit it to ohio sil artists but vocnoise the 
membership is sil is sil national sil so sil vocnoise sil its not its not 
really closed sil its just sil sort of focusing on ohio iver um vocnoise i 
cutoffththink i think it fills its niche sil yknow i mean i mean wexner has 
a niche and the and the museum has a niche vocnoise and um sil i 
think it fills it very well iver cutoffwewell sil yeah iver yeah iver laugh iver 
well im lucky in that way because vocnoise sil um sil i get travel sil 
a lot sil and it and so sil yknow if theres something i really wanna 
see chicagos not that far vocnoise washingtons not that far sil um new yorks sil 
and errornyohyknow i dont get to new york that often but um sil yknow i 
mean i can i cutoffsstill sil still have access to a lot of stuff if 
i wanna sil go to the trouble sil iver sil i do i do sil 
um sil art fairs sil iver and i have sil yknow ive sil vocnoise got 
a couple in chicago and and i have couple in vocnoise uh the washington area

sil yknow i mean they do shows on christmas if they had them but noise 
i yknow i sil id do sil ten twelve a year iver which is not 
cutoffrealreally sil not a lot iver yeah sil yeah sil iver me sil yeah sil 
uh for me sil uh sil it sil it seems like vocnoise sil um sil 
i have a mid western sort of humor sil vocnoise which works best in the 
mid west sil vocnoise i mean i have sil i have some sil east coast 
clientele and and sil vocnoise sil uh cutoffbubut sil and sil but like when i 
go to florida sil iver the people who sil who really like my work sil 
happen to be the people who are vacationing from sil columbus so iver laugh iver 
vocnoise sil no ive never been to that one sil that one has a big 
cutoffrepreputation sil thats a sil iver a famous one laugh iver oh yeah iver yeah 
iver oh yeah its huge iver sil well sil unknownynkow i cutoffrread sil i sil 
read a lot about sil about sil uh sil these particular errorbritisbritish sil british artists 
sil even before the show and before vocnoise um the mayor had a cow sil 
so to speak but um sil vocnoise uh sil so i sil yknow i mean 
its sil some of some of the pieces are interesting its sil its not sil 
exactly cutoffmmy my style sil vocnoise sil but sil frankly vocnoise sil i sil yknow 
sil i sil just didnt see laughanythingtogetthatworked up about sil vocnoise sil i mean i 
hessaw i saw cutoffr sil uh sil uh sil the piece sil the piece that 
he specifically objected to and and sil read about it sil and sil sil laugh

yeah sil i think it was just a political thing sil vocnoise sil iver iver 
yeah sil iver yeah laugh iver oh yeah sil yeah sil vocnoise sil and i 
havent i havent heard the rest of the story sil but sil um what ive 
heard of sil i mean sil in sil in court he wouldnt have a chance 
sil a snowballs laughchanceofever sil iver unknownever sil actually being able to sil to rescind

we dont like to think vocnoise laughaboutthese things happening sil vocnoise iver sil a little 
bit yeah iver vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise sil that sil uh sil vocnoise laughwell 
well i know about the gorilla masks sil laughandandthe vocnoise sil and that uh yknow 
i unknownwordword sil vocnoise sil its a a womens organization cutoffthathat sil uh sil to

sil to male hierarchy sil yknow cutoffththe sil that only only men get are in 
the museums and sil vocnoise sil only men get the big sil gallery shows and 
stuff like that iver sil i cutoffddont i dont think so sil in new york 
it might be sil i mean like i say its a lot more competitive there 
here sil i think sil i think sil columbus sil is sil vocnoise and the 
mid west in general sil i sil think is much sil more open sil iver

out the effort i mean you do have to sil yknow that you have to 
sell yourself theres sil yknow vocnoise sil youre not gonna just sit around and wait 
to be discovered vocnoise sil but um sil if you put out the effort i 
really cutoffdodont sil i dont think theres sil that kind of sil vocnoise that kind 
of discrimination anymore sil iver badly laughi vocnoise sil marketing is not my strong suit 
i mean most of the stuff that i get is just sil is a sil 
is an accident i started working for o s u because vocnoise sil another sil 
uh illustrator that they used who wasnt gonna be able to do the work anymore

and of course they talk funny sil in the east but sil um sil vocnoise 
that yknow vocnoise sil other than that other than the culture shock sil um sil 
it wasnt sil it wasnt that different iver yeah if i had sil um sil 
if i had stayed for the i i didnt graduate so if id stayed for 
the fourth year sil um when we did a lot would do a lot of 
um sil uh sil uh sil making up a portfolio that kind of thing sil

was nineteen seventy and there was kent state and laughtherewas vocnoise yknow all that stuff

about it to really say but it sil i sil cant sil i mean it 
vocnoise i dont know where they got that iver sil i sil yknow maybe im 
oblivious to things but i mean i mean seems like theres sil lot of worse 
places iver sil i vocnoise sil yknow cutofffrom from my vocnoise perspective which is skewed 
of course sil to me i think it just seems that way i mean it 
was vocnoise were only talking about ten cases thats not very many sil yknow cutoffthathat 
i mean sil you could by coincidence sil have them all be african american sil 
um sil vocnoise if i were african american i think i would have a different 
perspective sil and i yknow i dont sil dont live in a neighborhood where we

that sil its cutoffcolucolumbus its just columbus its just columbus sil ah maybe its because 
sil um sil vocnoise sil people dont sil take advantage of cutoffwwhats sil dont realize

either sil well they need to get out more sil laugh sil vocnoise laughimean yknow 
all this sil oh well never be a major league city until we have major

yknow that would be such a small sil part sil of sil of sil civilization 
anywhere sil for me sil and um sil im pretty pleased with the way sil 
things are moving along and i just sil id sil im sil i really do 
think people dont take advantage of it sil the way they should iver sil i 
think so iver i think so iver laughwell laugh yeah laugh yeah a little iver 
a little geography wouldnt hurt iver yeah that sil thats one of the drawbacks laugh 
iver yeah iver yeah sil yeah iver yeah iver or the festivals in the summer 
sil that they have downtown sil i mean those are sil those are really great 
and theyre yknow i mean sil theyre theyre crowded but theyre peaceful yknow theres not 
theres not rioting in the streets and theres a lot to do sil and great 
sil yknow great music sil iver vocnoise iver yeah iver sil yeah iver no i 
dont sil iver sil i cutoffddo sil i do sil ah sil i have ive 
have sil uh sil and yknow there kids in the neighborhood and vocnoise sil the 
grownups talk and i cutoffttalk i talk to the kids too i theres a a 
girl that lives next door who i we talk a lot vocnoise she just started 
at um everett sil the uh sil arts middle school vocnoise iver boy sil i 
sil yknow sil i sil i dont sil not having kids and then yknow not 
being that close to it its hard to know sil i mean ive always sil 
ive always thought that sil that sil um sil what their friends did noise and 
what they sil vocnoise sil what they were exposed to at home sil had sil 
as much sil influence as as anything that sil that the school could do but 
i know the school sil school is a very powerful force in a kids life 
sil yknow i mean it is a kids life vocnoise sil iver yeah iver vocnoise 
with cutoffthathat sil no i no i am definitely in favor of that i mean 
sil yes sil its the sil cutoffiit the parents sil is the parent is supposed 
to do it sil and one would hope that the sil parent sil would get 
there before sil before the health class did but if the parent isnt gonna get 
there sil this is the only way theyre sil ever gonna sil find laughout unknown 
iver umhum iver vocnoise sil i sil i think it is sil because sil uh 
vocnoise when cutoffii sil i was a sophomore in high school before it dawned on 
me that tab a and slot b laughhadanyrelation to the stuff that we were learning 
with the charts and the diagrams vocnoise and um vocnoise but i think kids are 
a lot more aware now sil from sil cutoffc because of what theyre exposed to 
vocnoise yknow in movies and everything cutoffjjust yknow just sil tv just daily life vocnoise 
um either theyre a lot more aware sil they sil they have sil i sil 
hesi hesthey they go into it with a lot of vocnoise of uh myths and 
misapprehensions sil but they definitely have thoughts about it sil and and sil i think 
they i think they need to laughknow vocnoise iver vocnoise i well sil yknow i 
cutoffddont sil i dont see how we can say sil hesi i mean sil we 
can cutoffrefuse sil refuse to cutoffsee sil to see certain classes sil of sil movies 
or sil or watch sil certain classes of shows but i sil yknow without getting 
into that first amendment thing i cant sil yknow i dont see how we can 
sil have a code of conduct sil yeah sil yeah sil boy i dont know 
sil im sil im sil yknow ive vocnoise never seen it happen in sil in 
my lifetime sil yknow sil so i cutoffdodont i dont know if it could be 
but then of course it cant go on the same way sil cutoffforevforever yknow it 
cant sil keep sil laughprogressing vocnoise i dont sil think iver the laughnaked weather girl 
laughyeah laugh vocnoise yeah sil yeah iver cutoffwewell it it iver hesit it makes me 
wonder because sil um sil i dont sil i dont see a lot of movies 
so a lot of this is yknow just sil from reading reviews and stuff sil 
but it seems like sil yknow sil last sil last year two explosions would do 
the sil job this year you gotta have five explosions sil and two car sil 
chases sil and and mutilated bodies sil yknow its it sil just seems like sil 
it sil it sil you need more and more sensationalism to sil sell your sil 
to sell your sil product and uh sil its scary sil sil hesi sil its 
cutoffrreally sil its really hard to do sil to sil to sil talk about sil 
morals sil um without sil bringing sil uh yknow sil religious background or something into 
it i think sil i think sil ah sil the way the schools should approach 
it laughisthat sil if you get pregnant its gonna ruin your life so you dont 
want to do that sil do you laugh laughyknowthat sort of thing vocnoise iver noise 
sil boy thats a sil thats a really tough one sil i hadnt i hadnt 
thought about sil that and and sil high school kids are so sil touchy about 
sil i mean sil about sil touchy about sexual identity and sil and so likely 
cutoffththat yknow so insecure in their own that theyre really sil likely to come down 
hard on somebody sil who has a has a different orientation vocnoise and i cutoffdodont 
i dont know sil vocnoise i dont know iver umhum sil yeah sil yeah sil 
iver yeah sil yeah sil yeah you cant ignore it sil i cutoffmmean sil because 
cutoffbebecause sil yknow because thats sil something else when i was in high school i 
cutoffddont sil dont sil think vocnoise i knew the word sil but sil um sil 
now cutoffeverybeverybody sil everybody knows sil unknown sil anybody whos a little bit different is 
likely to be called a faggot laugh and and vocnoise so its sil better if 
you can diffuse that but sil i cutoffwwouldnt boy i wouldnt know sil how to 
approach it sil i mean i think it should be approached sil but vocnoise i 
wouldnt have a clue iver yeah iver yeah vocnoise iver yeah iver yeah iver i 
think sil i think they should sil um sil i sil think a lot of 
the fear of this material comes sil uh sil from people who hold the belief 
that sil that sil you choose sil your orientation vocnoise that you can be converted 
sil to homosexuality and i sil personally dont believe that so it sil i yknow 
im not afraid sil of it sil but i can see how sil people would 
hold the opposite view sil and that i thats where this errorcomefmicomesfrom comes from but 
sil since i think theyre wrong laugh sil i think it should be my way 
sil and i think i think yknow cutoffththe i think the material should be there 
sil i think it cutoffshshould sil vocnoise yknow dealt with in a calm and reasonable 
way sil and i think it should be accessible to the kids iver noise iver 
yeah sil yeah iver cutoffii sil i sil think sil i think its cutoffffair i 
think its fair i think it should be sil that domestic partners sil should be 
sil should be covered vocnoise i think there should probably be some sil uh sil 
yknow some cutoffrrestrictions some restrictions there should sil be some level of sil commitment sil 
yknow sil cant just be your roommate sil laugh iver sil has to be a 
long standing kind of thing vocnoise yeah yknow and that that worries me more than 
vocnoise noiseum sil i hesi cutoffeh sil understand a lot of the objection is because 
this is just sil uh sil this is opening the door a crack and the 
next thing you know sil cutoffii sil yknow one legal sil step leads to another 
legal step and then well have gay marriage and all those things but vocnoise i 
dont think that would be a bad noisething either iver umhum sil yeah iver yeah 
iver yeah yeah i heard something about that iver yeah iver vocnoise laughdoitthehardwayortheeasyway laugh vocnoise 
well i noisethink everybody should have to do it the hard way sil i mean 
frankly vocnoise um i think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about 
it sil vocnoise sil vocnoise iver laugh sil vocnoise sil and um sil vocnoise laughimean 
i know i didnt think that much about it oh well im not doing anything 
else why not laugh sil vocnoise um vocnoise sil vocnoise sil and um vocnoise ah 
sil vocnoise sil vocnoise i cutoffmeamean i mean ah vocnoise sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil 
i dont i it seems sil kind of silly to legally have sil two levels 
i mean either vocnoise sil vocnoise sil either you gonna vocnoise sil go do it 
the hard way or you not iver sil and and sil no legal sanctions are 
gonna make any particular difference vocnoise to the attitude you have going into it iver 
right iver divorced yeah iver vocnoise uh sil three years sil something like that sil 
hard to remember vocnoise laugh laughitwasalongtimeago iver oh it was it was easy iver um 
sil yeah sil vocnoise yeah sil cutoffwwe yeah we didnt go to court sil uh 
iver vocnoise sil we just agreed sil to get divorced he went to cutoffssee he 
yknow i didnt even see the lawyer he just brought papers for me to sign 
and sil iver yeah there was yknow there was no property vocnoise iver um well 
there was a house i didnt want it vocnoise so that was easy sil iver 
um no children sil so vocnoise sil it was quite easy for us sil iver 
hum iver sil boy i dont know im cutofft sil thinking sil yknow of the 
the sil divorced people i know whove had sil children and vocnoise involved sil and 
um sil boy it always seems to me by the time they get to that 
step sil noise sil its already sil yknow theyve laughalready been to counseling theyve already 
tried a lot of other things sil vocnoise sil and that theyre sil vocnoise cutoffai 
sil i dont know whether vocnoise sil vocnoise sil some kind of sil court ordered 
vocnoise sil thinking about it sil laugh sil heavy thinking would uh iver would make 
any difference or not sil vocnoise sil noise sil iver i think so sil iver 
vocnoise i think they should be vocnoise sil i think they should be subject to 
the same rigorous scrutiny sil that sil that um hetero couples are vocnoise sil vocnoise 
sil yknow with home visits and and economic tests and all these kind of things 
sil vocnoise sil but um vocnoise the gay people i know sil vocnoise sil vocnoise 
sil uh sil the ones that would vocnoise that would want to be parents i 
think would make great parents sil vocnoise sil iver laugh iver yeah iver yeah iver 
yeah vocnoise iver well one would cutoffn one would hope that sil there would be 
enough sil uh sil vocnoisewordword sil vocnoise sil education on the subject that the kids 
wouldnt think it was that odd vocnoise iver sil vocnoise sil um sil that sil 
that sil vocnoise you had two dads iver laughyou were adopted by two laughdads i 
mean vocnoise i mean theres sil cutoffllot sil a lot uh cutoffy sil vocnoise sil 
cutoffbecaubecause cutoffiits sil its its difficult to adopt children i mean and it and it 
should be sil vocnoise sil and so sil the children they would likely sil take 
would be troubled to begin with iver vocnoise yknow mixed race vocnoise sil or or 
handicapped or vocnoise yknow vocnoise sil vocnoise hard to place iver older kids yknow iver 
vocnoise uh yeah it would be just one more thing vocnoise iver yeah sil one 
more thing to deal with on the other hand vocnoise it beats sil beats sil 
yknow sil growing up in fifty foster homes or an orphanage or vocnoise iver yeah 
iver yeah sil iver umhum iver yeah sil yeah iver sil getting them some place 
stable sil iver with people who want them sil vocnoise iver yeah sil yeah sil 
vocnoise sil iver and like i say i dont i dont believe that homosexuality is 
taught vocnoise um sil vocnoise i sil think the kid will grow up and sil 
discover girls and sil be just fine vocnoise iver sil or grow up and discover 
boys either laughway iver yeah sil yeah iver sil vocnoise sil iver vocnoise sil well 
i cutoffththink it sil starts with vocnoise with allowing uh sil vocnoise heather has two 
mommies sil iver in the elementary school library vocnoise sil its vocnoise sil um sil 
vocnoise sil cutoffi sil vocnoise sil we focus on sex so much vocnoise in our 
society i think vocnoise sil and and sil vocnoise sil part of family cutofflilife unknown 
so uh sil sex is such a small part of family life sil vocnoise yknow 
i mean it vocnoise sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil uh especially with the elementary school 
kids sil i mean its just sil vocnoise sil is vocnoise is there milk and 
cookies after school iver thats the key laughthing iver sil vocnoise yknow cutoffddo yknow do 
i feel safe is this a place i can go is there somebody sil vocnoise 
sil who always takes care of me sil vocnoise sil and and i think left 
to their own devices sil iver sil vocnoise sil ah vocnoise sil vocnoise the younger 
kids wouldnt think anything about it sil iver noise sil yknow vocnoise sil vocnoise sil 
you got two adults in your house it doesnt matter what gender they are iver 
and i think vocnoise i think if we could vocnoise yknow if sil if we 
could just keep that going sil into into sil middle school sil iver where its 
sil where its not such sil its sil its not weird its just a family 
iver um vocnoise noise sil vocnoise sil then when you start to talk about homosexuality 
it would be easier to vocnoise sil vocnoise sil noise sil uh vocnoise it would 
be easier for the kids to sil to see that sil theyre just people vocnoise 
sil yknow vocnoise iver yeah sil vocnoise iver yeah vocnoise sil yeah vocnoise iver vocnoise 
sil um sil vocnoise sil i vocnoise sil vocnoise sil i see it as a 
problem and and if i sil if i sil if i were vocnoise african american 
sil vocnoise sil i would sil vocnoise sil vocnoise i would not like to see 
it simply because sil uh sil yknow it it sil vocnoise sil its a cutoffchichild 
a child not being brought up sil vocnoise in his sil yknow in his sil 
tradition vocnoise sil vocnoise sil but on the other hand vocnoise id sil hate to 
cutoffssee i hate to see vocnoise sil vocnoise a child left in foster care vocnoise 
or in an orphanage when he could have a home vocnoise and um sil i 
think ah vocnoise parents who are willing to cutoffadoadopt sil uh sil going sil willing 
to adopt sil vocnoise sil uh sil a black child or a mixed race child 
sil vocnoise sil or an asian child or any cutoffge vocnoise are gonna are gonna 
be sensitive to the sil to cultural things because were just sil vocnoise sil yknow 
its just the cutoffwway vocnoise sil vocnoise sil the way cutoffththings sil things are slanted 
these days i mean diversity vocnoise is an issue sil vocnoise sil and sil people 
who are vocnoise sil vocnoise sil willing to vocnoise venture out sil into sil uh 
mixed race adoption sil would vocnoise sil already be sil way hip sil to diversity 
vocnoise and would iver would be sil would be interested sil in sil i mean 
i mean vocnoise not just for the kids sake but but would be interested vocnoise 
on their own behalf sil in in teaching the child what uh iver what his 
background really was iver right iver cutoffeexactly sil yeah iver exactly iver exactly but i 
do vocnoise there and theres the other side um sil they hesuh with sil with 
native americans too vocnoise its sil yknow yknow our children are being noisetaken away from 
us sil well not exactly youre giving up your children and vocnoise and vocnoise noisethen 
vocnoise something has to be done vocnoise but sil but theres also sil theres also 
that sil uh sil i cutoffmmean sil i mean i think sil that sil it 
is probably a legitimate sil fear that sil children cutoffoof children of that group sil 
are gonna sil yknow sil gonna be homogenized vocnoise out of sil out of their 
heritage sil but vocnoise i dont know sil uh sil yknow theyre noisekids without parents 
laugh iver yeah iver yeah iver if you cared that much about about sil keeping 
your keeping your own vocnoise well laugh theres the kids ready to be laughadopted iver 
umhum is iver thats thats what i would sil i would think in that noisecase 
i errormoonmean sil i mean because the dominant culture vocnoise it i mean is always 
gonna be accessible to them iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah and cutoffeveryeveryone 
iver laugh laughtoyou yeah sil yeah and and to a certain extent everybody gets the 
same upbringing vocnoise cutoffbebecause vocnoise through cutoffthrthrough mass media sil and and and noise sil 
well vocnoise malls laugh iver yeah iver umhum iver laugh iver oh yeah iver is 
laughyeah iver yeah iver yeah iver well i vocnoise cutoffwhawhat sil what sil what neighborhood 
do you live in sil noisebecause vocnoise i yknow i see asians and indians and 
sil all cutoffkinkinds sil everywhere but boy they dont live on my street iver laugh 
iver yeah iver yeah iver laugh laughyeah vocnoise right yeah iver yeah iver yeah iver 
laugh iver umhum iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah sil yeah iver um sil cutoffyeyeah 
vocnoise people that live there i mean weve got the the yknow the indian department 
stores right down there on high street and vocnoise and a sil couple of asian 
groceries sil but laughiwas laugh yknow i vocnoise i vocnoise sil i dont know where 
they live laugh i laughmeanit it seems cutofflilike it seems like for those stores to 
be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i dont sil i dont 
know iver vocnoise well i dont know the people that i see vocnoise around vocnoise 
um noise yknow theyre grownups iver really iver yeah iver um sil yeah iver yeah 
iver yeah um youre cutoffmmaybe you yeah you may be right sil could be sil 
could be iver i never thought of that iver an option iver i think so 
sil i think so vocnoise um sil its sil its so sad to see sil 
a girl sil yknow vocnoise have so many options closed off sil now i dont 
mean its by any cutoffsstretch sil stretch that its a tragedy vocnoise to have a 
baby but vocnoise um sil somebody in high school sil is sil is sil making 
a lot of decisions she doesnt intend to make iver uh sil and uh sil 
unknown decisions are happening to her without her making them sil and um vocnoise i 
think she needs to have sil as many sil facts as she can get her 
hands on iver yeah iver vocnoise and i think sil um sil vocnoise of sil 
course we would all hope that abortion wouldnt be sil that cutoffnnobody that nobody would 
have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in 
a situation where they would need one vocnoise um sil but sil i also think 
vocnoise uh yknow i cutoffmemean i mean sil yeah there shouldnt be there shouldnt cutoffsshouldnt 
shouldnt spend six weeks on abortion laughor sil six weeks on what to do if 
youre pregnant vocnoise um sil but sil but i think the subject has to be 
mentioned sil just sil just in passing in health class maybe and then and then 
sil there ought to cutoffyyknow sil it ought to be sil it cutoffshshould sil it 
should be known that you can go to your counselor iver and get some information 
iver yeah iver yeah sil yeah iver yeah im sil im opposed to parental noiseconsent 
noise noiseum vocnoise but sil i dont have noisekids so thats vocnoise that sil opinion 
doesnt mean as laughmuchasitmight from someone who did iver well sil yeah in a case 
like that sil cutoffththe sil the parents should laughknow sil laugh laughbecausetheressomethinggoingon iver that shouldnt 
be sil on the other hand id hate to see a thirteen year old vocnoise 
have a baby sil because she was afraid iver yeah iver yeah vocnoise well yeah 
sil yeah i mean it happened a lot sil and um sil ive sil had 
two abortions one sil illegal and one legal and legal is better sil vocnoise iver 
laugh sil vocnoise and um sil vocnoise sil yeah and and sil uh sil i 
would never vocnoise i would cutoffnnever sil i would never wanna go back to the 
old way sil never sil sil iver yeah sil yeah iver yeah sil yeah sil 
iver um i think so i think partial birth isnt sil such a big issue 
because i mean it hardly ever vocnoise sil comes up vocnoise sil but i vocnoise 
sil with so many things its its like a cutoffffoot its a foot in the 
door sil vocnoise if we can do that then we can say well yknow maybe 
vocnoise sil not in the vocnoise third trimester and then we can say well not 
in the second trimester and vocnoise iver sil iver yeah iver yeah sil iver laugh 
iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah i sil um sil i mean i know sil 
so many people who sil you know when they get pregnant sil get so sil 
are so conscientious sil about about what they eat vocnoise sil and and i mean 
they wont take antihistamines sil vocnoise sil in hay fever season and yknow so many 
things that they wont do and theyre so conscientious about it its hard for me 
sil vocnoise sil i mean i cutoffndunknown i just dont know anybody who sil smoked 
when they were pregnant or anything like that sil on the other hand i sil 
think sil vocnoise sil i vocnoise think its a choice sil and um sil i 
mean you cutoffwwanna you wanna sil you wanna try to help them you wanna sil 
make them aware of health sil issues sil but i mean a lot of women 
are not getting prenatal care vocnoise sil either sil and sil and sil thats part 
of it sil vocnoise sil and you cant vocnoise you vocnoise cant arrest them for 
that you just gotta get them to the doctor sil laugh iver iver sil yeah 
sil yeah iver yeah sil yeah i cutoffddidnt cutoffi sil if sil if sil a 
cutoffd sil there cutoffccant there cant be sanctions for doing the right thing sil and 
sil um sil uh sil so i would be cutoffoopposed im opposed to that sil 
i well yeah i sil i guess sil youd have to say that i was 
sil i vocnoise be opposed to sil vocnoise arresting mothers for anything sil vocnoise sil 
um sil in sil in sil in that relation vocnoise that its just sil that 
the effort should focus vocnoise on sil on getting them to stop sil but not 
sil forcing them to stop sil whatever it is theyre doing sil vocnoise sil iver 
excludename iver okay my parents are still married sil im from excludename i lived there 
all my life i was born here in columbus so i really havent known anything 
else vocnoise sil um sil have a dog named sammy sil vocnoise i work in 
the dorms as a night assistant sil and i have a girlfriend right now iver 
yeah iver yeah my dogs at home iver yeah i have two older brothers ones 
ten years older the other ones fifteen years older iver yeah iver um it didnt 
seem that much sil stranger than anyone else iver i mean my sil the middle 
brother was always around sil he wasnt very social in high school so iver yeah 
iver um im a pre art major right now hoping to get into computer animation 
iver freshman iver i went to excludename its the new high school there iver vocnoise 
iver yeah high school a lot of people are really narrow minded and sil work 
on really trying to fit in in college people are more open idea like open 
minded vocnoise and theyre more willing to express their own ideas iver i was more 
comfortable here than in high school sil you dont see like sil the big cliques 
like the popular abercrombie wearing extpeople or vocnoise like all the art students hanging out 
together its sil a big mix of people and everyones doing their own thing iver 
um sil freshman sophomore year yes sil after that i quit wrestling and sil i 
just kind of found myself being sil myself sil instead of trying to be someone 
else sil sports is definitely sil part of a clique you try to be part 
of the extteam and the team tries to do everything the same iver so everybodys 
trying to be like everyone else iver it was part of that i started wrestling 
because a lot of my friends did iver so sil i mean basically the entire 
winter id either extbe sil doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with 
my friends so vocnoise the whole reason i quit wrestling is because the coach wanted 
me to cut too much weight vocnoise i was really starting to feel it physically 
iver yeah i was cutting twenty pounds in three days iver dehydration iver youd run 
around in three pairs of sweat suits and sil vinyl jump suit over that vocnoise 
under heaters iver youd sleep in three pairs of sweats so youd lose about two 
and a half pounds in your sleep iver it is thats why i quit iver 
by the end i was pretty much sil just puking up blood and passing out 
a lot iver there were a lot of teammates that were cutting that much weight 
if not more sil they were pretty much doing it for the team noise iver 
yeah by then it was junior year sil when we were wrestling extvaristy and everyone 
just figured it was two more years left they could just sil struggle through it 
iver it definitely did because sil i would sleep vocnoise probably sil the sil eight 
hours sil right after practice until i woke up in the morning iver i delivered 
the columbus dispatch in the morning too so iver it was pretty much deliver papers 
go to class wrestling sleep iver almost all the parents did iver but hed bring 
in nutritional list or whatever to explain to the extparents sil blah blah blah iver 
so iver yeah iver not that i know of none of the other sports teams 
were so sil inclined to sil like push their athletes to cut weight iver or 
to do anything extreme to their bodies iver umhum iver and the lower you are 
apparently the easier it is or something sil that was the coachs philosophy anyway iver 
some of them are athletes theyre pretty much just extpreppy student council im good at 
school but bad outside of school vocnoise theyd go out and party outside of school 
but theyd join all like the students against drugs programs iver so theyre really hypocritical 
iver theres a little bit well quite a bit of it was yeah sil some 
of the people in the group didnt play sports but it wasnt all from one 
sport or sil it was football wrestlers vocnoise it was usually sil like the best 
football players the best wrestlers iver in high school yeah i was friends with most 
of them iver but i just didnt sil hang out with sil the entire crowd 
iver yeah iver it wasnt so much of a hate thing it was just more 
these are the people i like to hang out with extif sil you dont like 
that thats fine iver vocnoise our school wasnt really a violent one there werent really 
any fights or anything iver it was mostly caucasian sil and very few asian and 
other ethnicities iver yeah my roommate actually had that teacher and sil none of the 
allegations are true iver she was alleging that students were writing racial slurs on their 
desks and stuff sil but sil i had friends in classes of hers and none 
of them wrote any iver they never saw it they never said anything about it 
sil sil iver a lot of people switch from being like the really quiet more 
reserved people to the sil party animal iver go out and have fun person iver 
just the number of people that were here iver iver brother iver brother jed iver 
yeah iver um sil i talk to him every now and then iver yeah iver 
yeah i think every college does iver um vocnoise im a lutheran and a lot 
of what he says about everyone going to hell iver is extreally opposing my beliefs 
so i stand there and pretty much spar with him about it extand he usually 
ends up getting frustrated and tells me to leave iver well sil he told a 
jewish friend of mine that sil her grandparents that died in the holocaust went to 
hell because they were jewish sil iver yeah he says vocnoise a lot of racial 
slurs like that hes really homophobic iver where extas vocnoise i dont know lutheran is 
a little bit more open to iver homosexuality i guess iver just pretty much that 
if you ask for forgiveness forgiveness is granted vocnoise whatever iver um doesnt sil just 
because you sin doesnt mean youre going to exthell iver vocnoise and vocnoise pretty much 
stuff like extthat sil and hed try to quote the bible and id have a 
bible there with me and id look it up and vocnoise it wouldnt sil it 
wouldnt be right at all iver yeah laugh iver yeah sil iver well when hes 
telling my friends that their grandparents went to hell because theyre of a different religion 
iver thats pretty extreme iver yeah um sil ive grown up here all my life 
so it really hasnt shocked me all that extmuch iver yeah i had about three 
or four friends that were actually gay iver it wasnt a huge shock it wasnt 
my first encounter with homosexuality iver if they wanna get married thats their business i 
dont sil think extits sil mine or anyone else to say that they cant iver 
theyre normal people just outside of sil their sexual sil well sil majority of the 
people prefer sil heterosexual iver relations but theyre normal people outside of theyre sil homosexuality 
i mean its nothing different than regular parents iver i sil really am not educated 
in that at all so i wouldnt sil probably say anything sil since id sil 
ignorant in the field iver umhum iver yeah he uses a lot extof sil different 
slurs towards sil gay people iver yeah i remember political correctness iver changing the words 
doesnt change how someone feels about something iver i dont think its made us any 
better or any extworse iver its just change the language iver vocnoise i dont think 
so not with the diversity that we have here vocnoise iver i mean if we 
were that racist of a city then we wouldnt be that accepting to vocnoise gay 
pride extmarches and the black out that we had on campus a few weeks back 
iver with the n double a c p iver sil i vocnoise really dont think 
were incredibly racist iver i mean im sure there is some vocnoise but its sil 
not as extreme as some places that ive been iver vocnoise birmingham alabama laugh iver 
yeah laugh iver um vocnoise when i went i went with my friend iver sil 
and sil we were staying at his grandpas and his grandpa would sit on the 
back porch extand sil say all kinds of racial slurs towards black vocnoisepeople iver iver 
and everyone would be all right with that iver umhum iver i think so sil 
i mean theres enough open minded people in the country iver that i think that 
we would be ready iver vocnoise i mean colin powell was pretty close if he 
would have ran iver yeah iver id say its not any different than having a 
man i mean vocnoise its sil a person sil shed just have a different way 
of going about it cutoffclippingthe vocnoise probably sil iver id say probably the black man 
iver yeah well sil the white man would probably win but the black man also 
vocnoise has a vocnoise he has a better chance than the woman i think iver 
simply extbecause sil its not too much of a change from the status quo iver 
noise iver i was too young iver no iver all of his problems have extbeen 
personal problems that really shouldnt have been touched on vocnoise except the media got into 
it sil and vocnoise sil um vocnoise i mean we look up to the president 
to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they 
werent sil that shocked that a president would do something like that they were wondering 
why we were making such a big deal out of it sil and sil pretty 
much sil all the other problems sil well there werent really too many other problems 
i mean the economys sil doing really laughwell and sil foreign relations sil are always 
shaky but sil theyre getting a little bit better iver id probably vote for bush 
sil over clinton sil iver i dont think thatd change my mind about anything i 
mean sil i dont sil approve of his immoral behavior but vocnoise it doesnt change 
the way he runs the country iver im just more of a conservative person i 
mean sil im not sure exactly what his platform is sil but ive seen him 
speak a couple exttimes sil and sil i dont know he just sil impresses me 
more than al gore iver al gore really doesnt entice me at all he claims 
he invented the internet laugh iver all this other stuff iver vocnoise iver no itd 
probably be extsomething with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind 
iver sil or some kind of tax program iver that would probably affect my decision 
a little bit iver because i worked with a guy that was a cocaine addict 
for a while iver vocnoise and sil he couldnt have any kind of caffeine otherwise 
hed get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills iver to help sil 
calm him down iver and to learn anything it had to be the same thing 
over and over and over again until he got it right iver and that type 
of person i dont think would make a very effective president because sil i dont 
know president needs to be able to think fast on their feet vocnoise iver that 
would probably change my decision a little bit vocnoise iver yeah i dont think i 
could vote for a violent president sil i could vote for a president that made 
some mistakes with vocnoise their personal life iver gun control sil im not really too 
interested in sil i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns in the 
street sil big huge extguns and sil theyre one of the safest nations in the 
country vocnoise then you look at england they have no guns at all and theyre 
sil relatively safe sil so i mean iver its sil more our society than the 
guns i believe its more the person that would have the gun than the gun 
itself iver guns should definitely be kept in a lock box sil where kids cant 
get them sil besides that theres not a whole lot that sil government can do 
its more the parents responsibility to keep the guns out of their sil kids hands 
sil iver no the worst thing that happened was a wallet got stolen out of 
a locker iver yeah sil pretty much sil iver here at college i really havent 
witnessed any violence at all iver vocnoise i havent seen any fights i havent seen 
anyone get shot i mean you read about it in the lantern but vocnoise the 
only thing that i was really shocked about was sil the people begging on high 
street iver yeah thats really not something you see in worthington iver well vocnoise i 
agree that we should help them sil maybe through some sort of government sil program 
vocnoise sil but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that 
actually give them the money on high street because it really doesnt motivate them to 
get out of the gutter sil i mean if they can make a living off 
of begging change off of college students theyre probably gonna stay with that because its 
real easy life iver sil iver its about the same iver vocnoise they use drugs 
but not to the extreme vocnoise sil that sil college students do vocnoise iver high 
school sil marijuana sil acid sil mushrooms iver vocnoise no vocnoise errorerrorthat i didnt know 
anybody in vocnoise high school but in college i know some people that have used 
extcoke sil ecstasy sil it was more after the movie go sil iver mmhmm iver 
vocnoise it was about a sil bunch of teenage ravers iver and i mean sil 
i dont think a lot of people have ever heard of ecstasy until that movie 
iver kind of iver its like an advertisement for it vocnoise iver sil iver sil 
iver vocnoise yeah iver yeah i mean a lot of people really vocnoise that i 
knew anyway didnt know about ecstasy until they saw that movie and extthen sil it 
was the whole talk extof sil high school whatever sil iver there were a couple 
that would go to raves every now and then and use it vocnoise iver vocnoise 
downtown vocnoise abandoned warehouses that get rented out for a night iver sil theyre pretty 
much all underground things they have a web page up im not sure what the 
address is right now sil iver no ive had friends go vocnoise i was gonna 
go to one on halloween but didnt iver not really at parties parties are usually 
just sil mostly kegs sil sometimes theres pot sometimes theres not iver usually vocnoise sil 
every weekend iver mmhmm vocnoise sil iver they go to clubs vocnoise they go to 
bars clubs um raves sil any place where theres dancing iver and theres lighting effects 
like strobe lights disco balls iver yeah vocnoise iver mmhmm iver yeah vocnoise iver not 
at all vocnoise iver mmhmm vocnoise parties didnt change at all iver no kids just 
think oh it cant happen to me im invincible iver vocnoise iver he was recovered 
sil uh he was about thirty four years old iver and he was the assistant 
manager of a video game store i worked at in high school iver vocnoise i 
mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but sil it 
took him a while to catch on to things iver yeah vocnoise sil iver theres 
a lot more in college college its seven nights a week iver you can go 
anywhere sil get something to drink vocnoise sil iver yeah iver yeah iver mmhmm iver 
theres a mild fear it seems the cops always sil girls vocnoise ive never seen 
them take a guy out of a bar sil iver sil umhum sil iver sil 
vocnoise im not sure sil its usually the girls look younger than guys i guess 
i dont know iver because they f always dress up and everything when they go 
to the bars iver so vocnoise i mean the cops are just looking for people 
that look younger vocnoise iver sil they dont have time to go and look at 
the stamps on everyones hands and iver check their i ds sil vocnoise i mean 
the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger vocnoise 
sil iver sil iver sil vocnoise iver vocnoise guys will drink at the bar girls 
usually drink before the bar vocnoise iver sil vocnoise as is my experience vocnoise iver 
vocnoise sil because the girls are afraid and paranoid of getting caught with cutoffclippinganother sil 
with a container at the bar vocnoise iver vocnoise the guys think its macho or 
whatever to be able to buy beer iver vocnoise sil iver sil yeah four nights 
a week sometimes iver sil recently its been like sil saturdays sil iver thats about 
it vocnoise sil iver sil iver yeah because theres no fear of being caught by 
the parents iver theres no one to like vocnoise sil check up on you vocnoise 
in your dorm room sil i mean vocnoise youre pretty much in control of your 
life at this point sil iver vocnoise i dont iver i dont really remember october 
if that laugh iver vocnoise yeah i still had a three point two vocnoise iver 
first quarter sil iver laugh iver yeah i s sil vocnoise i moved into the 
dorms vocnoise late september vocnoise last fall iver vocnoise me and my cutoffffriends sil two 
or vocnoise two other of my roommates vocnoise sil took a trip i went skydiving 
white water rafting and skydiving again right before we moved in iver like vocnoise sil

college and then vocnoise iver vocnoise couple times nothing really big vocnoise iver vocnoise i 
know a lot of my friends did but i didnt sil iver sil iver vocnoise 
i dont know how vocnoise sil you would define it as serious at this point 
sil because college is mostly binge drinking vocnoise sil vocnoise i think the real problem 
comes when you start drinking alone and everyday vocnoise iver sil because i mean when 
your friends arent around and theres no parties to go to you usually dont drink 
sil iver sil iver vocnoise iver sil id say my ex girlfriend laugh laughyeah laugh 
sil iver vocnoise sil vocnoise she could drink more than i could vocnoise iver vocnoise

do anything with a law degree iver yeah vocnoise sil iver no he doesnt have 
a problem with it at all vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise 
iver vocnoise oh when i was a senior in high school i wish sil my 
parents wouldve pushed me to do something practical but im glad they didnt sil because 
it gave me a chance to make my own decision vocnoise iver sil iver sil 
well it wouldve been vocnoise sil something that they wouldve supported and something that sil 
i wouldve probably been pretty good at vocnoise iver sil and vocnoise sil vocnoise they 
wouldve made it so i wouldnt have had to make the decision vocnoise i mean

six hours a day vocnoise iver sil iver vocnoise iver not at all vocnoise iver 
youre talking to people all over the country and vocnoise sil i mean youre vocnoise 
sil becoming more diversified because vocnoise you get sil thoughts and opinions from people vocnoise 
sil from all across the world and vocnoise iver vocnoise and its not just vocnoise 
like one group of people vocnoise iver sil vocnoise sil iver vocnoise noise sil iver 
yeah iver vocnoise iver vocnoise um sil media has a lot of control vocnoise over 
people sil but sil i believe that sil sometimes people just need a kick like 
that iver to get them thinking about it vocnoise then theyll start to notice it 
in their life and vocnoise once they start noticing it theyll start sil getting more 
and more into it sil iver vocnoise iver no humans are violent by nature i 
believe sil sil mean sil people have been at war since the beginning of man 
sil cutoffitits sil its more or less greed that causes violence its not sil media 
vocnoise media vocnoise just like the ecstasy was vocnoise an advertisement showing what you could 
do sil tvs sil showing you violence that you sil could do vocnoise if youre 
driven to it vocnoise noise sil iver okay one sil two sil three sil four 
sil five sil testing cutofftestitesting unknown laugh sil vocnoise when i was a kid my 
father got this tape recorder vocnoise in the days when they were those big yknow 
the wheels iver sil and god only knows hed get a half a dozen drinks 
in him then hed go around the house vocnoise testing testing say a few words 
for cutoffpoposterity and we used to think get him sil out of here yknow iver 
i guess thats what it is but i dont have a video camera either but 
i as soon as you said that i thought i could just see him yknow 
oh iver drove me cutoffnahtqnuts say a few words for posterity hed say and wed 
say sil get out of here iver no sil i i um noise sil have 
very little contact with them and so vocnoise sil thatd be about the laughlastthingidbedoing sil 
okay where are we iver ill start asking you questions so that iver yeah okay 
iver uh iver eh vocnoise iver convenient laugh iver in what way iver umhum iver 
right right sil tremendous demand right now iver umhum iver umhum iver and youve been 
going to ohio state that whole time iver you should be getting pretty near iver 
vocnoise iver vocnoise excuse me iver laugh sil im guessing iver is it iver right 
iver sounds good iver oh i yeah exactly sil vocnoise sil i was just wondering 
how could i get a job doing what youre doing noise laugh vocnoise iver vocnoise 
i cutoffggrew sil grew up in masillon ohio im the oldest of five children i 
have four children my own sil im uh vocnoise i was sil previpreviously i was 
married many years ago vocnoise and then ive been married to my husband now for 
twenty one years vocnoise and we have um sil three children together so i have 
a daughter excludeat twenty eight vocnoise daughter at sil nineteen whos a sophomore at ohio 
wesleyan my older daughters a graduate from ohio excludename vocnoise sil im a graduate of 
excludename vocnoise i have a son whos uh cutoffninnineteen uh excludelets see joe is sil 
he sil fifteen hes a sophomore at sil excludename high school and i have an 
sil eighth grade daughter vocnoise at excludename vocnoise and um im a homemaker i have 
a degree in sociology vocnoise ive been at home since my vocnoise a second daughter 
was born sil with my second marriage vocnoise and i consider it a luxury and 
a privilege and i just absolutely love sil being at home i do a lot 
of volunteer work sil um vocnoise im real involved with the school system sil cutoffccolumbus 
with columbus public and uh sil i like sil organizing big projects for them um 
sil my husbands director of engineering for liebert sil vocnoise sil and so thats why 
i know what youre thinking yeah and whenever i complain about the weather in columbus 
he always says well go anywhere you want vocnoise where would you like to live 
vocnoise well i wanna stay here i dont wanna go anywhere yet til all my 
kids are ready sil and then my daughters always say vocnoise okay mom as soon 
as were all done with school sil vocnoise then we can all move to california 
but we have to go as a group because im real real close to to 
my children iver yeah really close iver vocnoise i sil im sure it makes it 
sil easier vocnoise but i think that a person can establish a relationship sil hesey 
you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship 
and so i think that even if i were working vocnoise yknow with my oldest 
daughter vocnoise i worked but i arranged my life around her so that sil even 
though i had that degree i waited tables because when she was sil little before 
she started school vocnoise i could go to work at five in the evening and 
she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her sil was with her 
all day vocnoise then when she started school i switched over to lunches vocnoise and 
sil so ive always arranged my life around my children sil so i have an 
opportunity to be with them iver they get sil better and better and better vocnoise 
sil i cutoffhehear iver im im really lucky um vocnoise yknow everyones always sil crabbing 
about their horrible kids and vocnoise sil my kids are phenomenal hesa we have this 
arrangement vocnoise sil i do sil everything i possibly can to make them happy iver 
and they do sil everything they possibly can to make me happy vocnoise and its 
like vocnoise sil um sil my my oldest girl she cutoffshshe sil were expecting our 
first grandchild here within a couple weeks sil and vocnoise sil she and i see 
each other all the time my daughter who goes to excludename chose to live at 
home because she just said it was sil just a better situation for her sil 
vocnoise sil and um sil its not that these girls arent independent and cant do 
it on their cutoffowown sil theyre sil megan could my second daughter could have lived 
on her own from the time she was vocnoise twelve sil i mean shes just 
a very very mature very driven vocnoise sil the only problem she has she didnt 
have a job to support herself other than that she could have taken care of 
herself vocnoise but sil cutoffshshe she chooses to sil still at home and be a 
part of our life and um sil vocnoise sil my son hes sil both those 
kids have four points i mean they really work hard in school because they know 
its important and my son was uh vocnoise sil he was the only cutofftitime only 
one that was vocnoise sil in seventh and eighth grade sil he sil took sil 
that time to do the maturing that most of his friends are doing at sixteen 
and so im really lucky vocnoise that we had our vocnoise difficulty at that point 
sil and uh sil and it was minimal sil but to me having been used 
to everything being perfect yknow excludeit was like vocnoise sil it was like for him 
to have sil um iver vocnoise for him to not make the honor roll every 
time i couldnt even imagine what was happening with him vocnoise sil and now hes 
completely back on track and doing really well vocnoise sil and my eighth grade daughter 
is um sil vocnoise sil shes sil vocnoise sil my kids are involved in all 
kinds of different things shes real involved with theater sil vocnoise sil um shes vocnoise 
yeah everything that comes along yknow she wins the science fair she errorgetget does the 
power of the pen vocnoise sil she cutoffk is on student cutoffcouncouncil they all have 
lots of vocnoise different kinds of things that theyre involved in vocnoise sil and that 
im incredibly proud of them because theyre just sil theyre sil and theyre really vocnoise 
theyre not geeky and goofy sil theyre really neat iver neat kids that kids like 
iver so iver theyre cutoffv they are theyre wonderful everybody always says to me rachel 
i just dont know what youre doing will you come and take care of mine 
for me vocnoise sil and its sil its the fact that i have a tremendous 
respect for my kids i mean i really value their opinions vocnoise sil and i 
treat them everybody says your moms weird she talks to us strange its because i 
talk to them like i talk to you vocnoise sil at at whatever age they 
are sil yknow i dont sil yeah i dont talk down to kids i sil 
iver sure iver sure iver yeah over the years sil weve had sil situations like 
that sil yknow a pregnancy here and there and things that people needed to get 
worked out or someone being worried about sil vocnoise i uh i sil a sil 
neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do with it 
and about it sil so yeah but yknow i vocnoise sil hesits its sil im 
just lucky im so lucky iver right iver oh im cutoffshsure sil im sure of 
the fact that my parents um vocnoise my mother tried cutoffrealreally tries really hard but 
my vocnoise sil my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so that 
he insisted yknow he cutoffccould sil he could errortdrink drink on the weekends and never 
miss sil work etcetera vocnoise sil yeah there was no problem vocnoise sil and uh 
vocnoise sil um vocnoise but the biggest problem is the fact that vocnoise sil he 
and i vocnoise i um sil i i cutoffexpexpected ive always expected to have some 
sort of a respect from them sil and because vocnoise they always wanted me to 
grow up and be sil independent and think for myself and so im exactly what 
they always said they wanted vocnoise sil its just that they cant sil handle that 
sil and so vocnoise sil when i was in seventh grade and i got a 
lot sil vocnoise sil in a lot of trouble about um the racial thing vocnoise 
sil because uh im from a school where i was mostly sil white students were 
vocnoise sil iver sil almost the minority it was a pretty even its a very 
its a low income neighborhood vocnoise sil and when i in seventh grade i remember 
going home and saying was everybody the same and being told well of course they 
are vocnoise sil so i went to school and told everybody i was in love 
with danny flowers who happened to be black vocnoise sil and i got called into 
the office and they called in a social worker and they sil i was punished 
i wasnt allowed to sil uh i was grounded for the year vocnoise and they 
never called this kid in i vocnoise i then i thought this whole thing is 
so screwed up vocnoise yknow cutoffwhawhats vocnoise sil whats wrong with these people vocnoise they 
kept saying that they wanted to save this errornithenice white girl because i had so 
much potential and uh they werent going to let me throw my life away like 
this so i was sil yknow its bizarre vocnoise and so i was always from 
that time on i decided these these people are all crazy vocnoise im never gonna 
im never gonna be like that vocnoise sil and so i have a whole lot 
of different values from my sil family sil vocnoise sil and sil its sil real 
hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger vocnoise sil are willing 
to sil go along with what my father thinks and says and if he sil 
wants it a certain way why sil you just dont question that and i just 
sil dont do sil that its wrong sil iver umhum iver umhum iver vocnoise right 
vocnoise right cutoffhhe sil he would go for weeks he would get mad at me 
and not speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two 
at a time my mother would say vocnoise sil please sil cutoffnancnancy sil i changed 
my name when i went to college i just decided im out of here im 
everythings gone vocnoise and so vocnoise she would say um nancy please just talk to 
your father just for vocnoise just for my sake sil please cutofftatalk vocnoise and i 
would think im the child here i shouldnt have to be the one to make 
peace in this family if he doesnt wanna talk to me vocnoise i dont need 
him i dont have to talk to him iver yeah iver right vocnoise right yknow 
iver yeah yeah yeah i shouldnt have to do this vocnoise im not responsible for 
the happiness of this family iver and the fact that i recognized all that and 
couldnt wait to get out of there and when i was gone sil i was 
gone vocnoise and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where vocnoise my 
cutofffamfamily in fact ive been happy about them lately because vocnoise um sil ive well

through all that together and be with these kids and have this this kind of 
time we have now hes looking forward to vocnoise hes thrilled about the cutoffdaudaughter the

to all their own iver uh they say sil oh no we dont want sil 
or id say lets get a foreign exchange student this would be fun vocnoise noise 
iver they say iver no mom we dont wanna do that because they dont wanna 
have to be responsible for them sil at school and wherever iver so iver i 
dont know but if everybodys ever gone im gonna ill sil ill sil find some 
im sure iver im im gonna keep doing the same stuff yknow ill find some 
other kid somewhere else and ill have some time yknow my husband and ill have 
time together and vocnoise i sil i always find some i always have a project 
sil yknow its like vocnoise im always saying vocnoise well when things slow down around 
here im gonna like right now i should be home counting money for the vocnoise 
i cutoffrraise i did a fundraiser for the the school hesand we sil raised um 
vocnoise we just sell sil uh morley candy and wrapping paper and all that kind 
of stuff vocnoise and our sales are anywhere from twenty five thousand to forty thousand 
dollars and so we get half of that for the profit and i do that 
sale myself but that also means vocnoise that vocnoise i have thousands and thousands of 
dollars to sort through and reconcile vocnoise so but anyhow im always saying when it 
slows down but then i always will find another project sil so vocnoise and i 
sil rehab houses sil whenever i get a chance i like to do that vocnoise 
sil so iver cutoffthetherell cutofftherell iver yeah iver no heswell sil its like vocnoise you 
buy it and then youd get to do the shopping the fun part you go 
out pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that and then you have 
somebody else do that laughpart laugh but i dont do like sil major vocnoise gutting 
or anything sil i just sil like to get something that needs vocnoise that that 
that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous 
sil if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen and blah blah blah blah 
blah blah blah vocnoise so thats the kind stuff and ive only done three or 
four of them but its fun iver because ive always liked to fix up cutoffhouhouses 
sil my own house iver yeah unknownyoucanjust yeah its fun iver uh huh sil uh 
huh iver right iver right iver umhum iver yeah iver vocnoise iver umhum iver too 
much iver yeah iver thats what you want iver yep iver yep iver laugh iver 
oh yeah iver umhum iver isnt that fun iver oh i know its so much 
fun iver yeah iver yeah i just like doing it and vocnoise i have a 
good set i my hesmy best friend is a realtor uh shes since retired but 
vocnoise its so funny because she would always go through hesall these sil statistics and 
this and that because it the stuff ive done is in excludename vocnoise and sil 
and because i live in excludename area vocnoise and so vocnoise she would say oh 
i dont know and shed say well how much do you have to get it 
for and how much should vocnoise and i would say vocnoise oh i dont know 
i think if i get it for under a hundred and five i probably can 
sell it for a hundred and forty if i do this this this and this 
sil now youre gonna put a lot of money into that though its not like 
youre youre still only gonna make maybe ten thousand dollars profit vocnoise but um vocnoise 
and she would say vocnoise well i dont know and for a long time she 
was always real skeptical because i would just like make up these numbers or just 
have this idea vocnoise and finally she says oh well rachel vocnoise i dont know 
it always works out for you you always get that so just sil do it 
and its just some sil intuition kind of thing iver but its fun iver uh 
huh me too years ago laugh iver laugh iver i know thats iver i know 
iver i laughknow iver its so funny thats what my daughters i do were cutoffgoigoing 
then were always looking and saying vocnoise hmm there could do this this this this 
sil yeah vocnoise and plus iver it is and plus the thing is too like 
when we bought our house we had looked for sil months and months and months 
and i wanted an old house vocnoise it was built like nineteen seventeen vocnoise i 
wanted an old house that hadnt been vocnoise kept up iver yeah the same thing 
you were talking about and uh were only the third people to live in it 
vocnoise and so vocnoise it needed sil everything yknow and it had gold cutoffcarpcarpet now 
golds back but in those days everything was like gold and yknow and vocnoise green 
it was horrible vocnoise and uh sil it was great fun sil we had sil 
we had lot fun we vocnoise we took the back porch and made it part 
of the kitchen and had another back porch put on uh vocnoise finished the third 
floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put an in ground pool 
and vocnoise so sil i always joke because what i paid for it vocnoise i 
now owe three times that amount sil on it iver but its because sil most 
people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a 
bigger mortgage sil so its just that kind of thing iver if you have specific 
questions were never get to them iver laugh iver ok iver vocnoise iver it cutofftotook 
it only took um the last one i did was on richards road which is 
right across from whetstone park iver and sil it only took sil um sil less 
than two months iver yeah and i had sold within cutoffsisix vocnoise well i waited 
i knew that what had to have happen on the outside which is really only 
some paint uh sil minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and vocnoise cleaning 
up the front yard and then we have vocnoise theres a guy who works for 
me whos um vocnoise i just dont know how he can cutoffaafford how he makes 
a living because hes very very reasonable hes also very loyal to me hes done 
stuff for me for years vocnoise and uh sil and hes not that old hes 
probably sil hes sil twenty eight or twenty nine now but anyhow pat went in 
vocnoise we added a bathroom there was a mud room we added a half bath 
off the kitchen and sil we put in the uh changed the back door and 
put in the deck and vocnoise he did those kinds of things sil and sil 
yknow and then we were ready to go and i said i was gonna sell 
it myself and everybody said i was crazy vocnoise and i had an open house 
sil and i sold it that day i had thirty i had sil like thirty 
some people in i got my offer that afternoon i got what i wanted vocnoise 
well i didnt get immediately vocnoise hesi the realtors told me i should ask a 
hundred thirty four and i asked a hundred forty six instead because i really sil 
felt sil i cutoffknknew vocnoise i knew that this was nice house and i knew 
it had beautiful hardwood floors built in bookcases vocnoise and i just knew that vocnoise 
hesi that i couldve seen me wanting that house and do you know what i 
mean its like that identity thing vocnoise and so vocnoise somebody came through and they 
sil uh with a realtor and they made me this sil offer that was real 
low it was like a hundred and thirty sil eight vocnoise and sil the the 
realtor its im thinking about it because was funny he delivered the offer to my 
home and i was gracious and i thanked him and i got inside and i 
opened up and i sil saw it sil and i went running out a porch 
i say vocnoise wait a minute vocnoise this is vocnoise never gonna work iver i 
said this will never work sil im not interested take it back vocnoise and he 
said vocnoise no no no just vocnoise lets just work with us just work with 
us well well take care of this vocnoise so i ended up selling to him 
for hundred and forty four vocnoise but it was just funny because i thought vocnoise 
he sil i thought sil vocnoise theyre never gonna get to where i have to 
be and were not even gonna play this game back and forth iver so and 
it was fun and i sil i made uh we made about vocnoise sil nine 
thousand on it by the time we were done iver umhum iver right iver right 
iver um i sil i um sil i do all of our own taxes i 
really sil i keep thinking i must be doing it wrong because its not that 
hard everybody acts like oh this is such a big deal iver you just get 
the booklets sil you call you sil ask the questions iver yeah and you read 
it iver yeah iver yeah exactly i know vocnoise iver really iver yeah exactly iver 
excuse me iver all you do is you just keep your records of hesof um 
sil yknow sil what you spend on things sil and then theres a form you 
fill out and how much vocnoise you have if youve taken any depreciation yknow you 
need to vocnoise sil basically put that back in vocnoise and deduct your costs vocnoise 
sil and then theres the percentage that goes on your schedule e that goes on 
the front of your form that goes into your income vocnoise and then its just 
taxed sil its just not its really not that hard iver vocnoise it i sil 
vocnoise i dont know how to tell you that um vocnoise i mean it it 
sil vocnoise iver well vocnoise yknow it vocnoise because i have to think about how 
it went back into our income with everything else vocnoise but sil im sure sil 
im sure that i didnt pay more than three thousand on it sil and sil 
it sil yknow it didnt cost me more than three thousand and so vocnoise if 
i had five or six thousand dollars out of it i was happy iver vocnoise 
i mean vocnoisesure cutoffahi i mean thats vocnoise thats a lot of money for having 
a good vocnoisetime yknow iver so i almost bought one vocnoise um uh sil cutoffblaabout 
couple weeks ago vocnoise in fact i went laugh vocnoise i went into contract on 
it with this guy vocnoise this dear old man whose it was for his mother 
who was in her nineties in a retirement home was on royal forest sil which 
is north vocnoise and sil i made this sil this low offer and i never 
thought that they would sil i didnt want it was kind of like i felt 
like i had to do this because i sil if i was gonna get this 
house i should get it vocnoise but i didnt really want now because of the 
baby coming and were gonna be busy and i didnt wanna get involved in vocnoise 
and so i made this offer and then he vocnoisecountered back yknow i offered him 
ninety exttwo vocnoise and he was asking ninety nine nine vocnoise so he countered back 
at ninety six and i said that sil and yknow i thought well good now 
i dont worry about hes never gonna come to it vocnoise so i wrote back 
and said yknow vocnoise i appreciate your offer but vocnoise ninety two vocnoise sil i 
sil ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was 
sil really the only thing i could hesi vocnoise i could do vocnoise and i 
didnt even give him a time to respond because i just just assumed i was 
just noise sil bowing out of it sil iver vocnoise sil i vocnoise sil vocnoise 
sil vocnoise checked my fax machine the next day it says vocnoise sil my mother 
has decided accept your offer and i thought vocnoise shit i dont laughthisone what am 
i gonna do now so vocnoise i ended up talking him and i vocnoise i 
just explained to him that vocnoise um hed caught me off guard and that i 
had more time to reconsider it sil and that because of sil and its true 
because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said that that point 
the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was sil just sil 
not gonna work sil for me vocnoise hes a nice man i sil felt bad 
sil and so then i gave him vocnoisesome ideas about how he could sell it 
iver to help him sil iver well i always assume youd be running it that 
whole time iver i mean i vocnoise iver see vocnoise the thing is vocnoise sil 
ideally sil i would rather if i were gonna buy house in clintonville to hold 
them and rent them vocnoise my problem is sil i dont have any money so 
vocnoise i vocnoise that down vocnoisepayment sil has to be ten percent down sil and 
so that means that i would have that tied up sil while it was being 
rented vocnoise like we bought a couple condos over on bethel road vocnoise its for 
my kids to live in so that my oldest girl when shes getting ready to 
move out shes like sil twenty four vocnoise and cutoffshshe they couldnt find any place 
to live that i thought was vocnoise that that i felt was safe and that 
was acceptable vocnoise vocnoiseso i finally decided well vocnoise well find something and ill buy 
and ill be your land lady and then whatll itll be nice sil and so 
vocnoise i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to vocnoise was thinking 
she was gonna move out when she graduated from high school vocnoise and changed her 
mind so i just rented that one but it the bottom line is sil i 
sil i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work 
sil with that helped me vocnoise buy those without any money vocnoise i didnt have 
a down payment i had nothing vocnoise so vocnoise so its like i can afford 
to hang on to those because the rent sil just makes the payment vocnoise but 
the other you would sil you would be fine you be renting it you wouldnt 
buy anything that you didnt think you could rent sil and come out even with 
iver um hum iver extyeah its gotta be hard if you havent vocnoise had other 
projects iver vocnoise iver uh huh iver yeah iver wow iver yeah iver yeah iver 
right iver right iver yeah vocnoise youre iver right iver it sil vocnoise right vocnoise 
i keep cutoffthinkthinking vocnoise oh i wanna go back and vocnoisetake some classes yknow i 
keep thinking id go back to school but i vocnoisecant even narrow down what i 
would wanna vocnoisetake theres so much stuff vocnoise theres so many areas that are interesting 
to me iver extyeah vocnoise yeah iver vocnoise oh i know iver noise iver yeah 
iver right iver thats exactly how i am when you said what would i do 
yknow i might do house i might do cutoffsschool go to school some i used 
to own a gallery i might do something like that again vocnoise yknow theres just 
like vocnoise theres just zillions of projects out there waiting to happen and so its 
just iver it was sil we had a little gallery um sil we were in 
clintonville for a sil a year or so and then we moved to grandview vocnoise 
and it was just fine art sil we called it fine art vocnoise crafts sil 
and it was handmaid stuff from local vocnoisepeople and we had lot of jewelry and 
pottery and vocnoise silk vocnoise and paintings that kind stuff sil iver vocnoiseand it was 
it was fun noise vocnoise i met a lot of neat vocnoisepeople vocnoise in fact 
thats where i met the woman whose child i took care of she was one 
the artists who came to me vocnoise hesand vocnoise it but it was not vocnoise 
nobody was gonna make any money on it sil and it was the kind of 
thing that vocnoise it was a project i started it when my youngest daughter started 
kindergarten because i needed a new project vocnoise and i didnt know vocnoise anything about 
it sil id never even been in a gallery vocnoise i thought vocnoise uh sil 
thisll be fun vocnoise ill just rent this space because i found this space and 
i was trying think of something i could do with it vocnoise so i thought 
well ill rent this space vocnoise extand then ah sil i know what ill do 
sil ill just put an ad in the paper and ill find a bunch of 
artists and then ill set this business up vocnoise so vocnoise and it was consignment 
so i didnt needed that money i just needed rent sil and we had art 
classes and that was fun vocnoise and so sil once i got that whole thing 
all set up and all ready to go vocnoise its not nearly as interesting once 
yknow you sil i like i like to make it exthappen vocnoise im not really 
vocnoise interested in just sitting there day after day waiting for somebody to come extin 
and so sil when the lease was up on high street i was gonna get 
rid of it vocnoise and a couple people came to me that were artists there 
and said vocnoise could we vocnoiseplease yknow would you consider having some partners vocnoise and 
i said sure if you guys are willing to come and sit in this place 
and i dont come sit here so we moved to grandview vocnoise and it was 
doing unknown sil much better over there sil extand hesum vocnoise then the vocnoisesamething happened 
vocnoise extthe attorneys who were next door to us decided they wanted our space and 
when our lease sil was up sil they had more money than we did so 
vocnoise we were gonna have to move extagain and i just said sil this is 
not worth it sil and vocnoisebesides that i was ready that was about vocnoise three 
four years into it vocnoise i was ready to do vocnoisesomething else sil and i 
had already started taking care of jesse then so vocnoise i used to take him 
down to the gallery with me and i had a little bassinet in the extback 
and vocnoise people vocnoisesayisthat a baby laugh iver yeah you just find it vocnoise i

just happened to be sil what we like to the way we like it do 
you know what i mean vocnoise and its its not sil um sil because sil 
yknow i consider our sil my whole house a lot of feminists yknow were all 
real strong about that but the thing is vocnoise since i have the luxury of 
being at home vocnoise and peter hesis doing a job that vocnoisehe really enjoys vocnoise 
and i am doing something i enjoy vocnoise i really am happy to do vocnoise 
all of those things that typically women do vocnoise because noise thats my job thats 
my trade off yknow i dont have to go someplace else i can get vocnoise 
i can go and have coffee everyday with my daughters i can go cutoffshshopping sil 
cutoffyyknow do whatever i want vocnoise and im happy to do these other things iver 
and so vocnoise yknow even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown 
vocnoise its not vocnoise its not because i vocnoisehave to sil its not because he 
yknow he wouldnt do something that that something else sil its sil this suits me 
fine iver and so thats a whole different thats real different from the way it 
used to be even though it looks the same iver right which is what we 
look like iver but its not iver right iver right iver umhum iver right iver 
cutoffeexactly iver exactly iver right iver right iver right iver right iver i sil vocnoise 
thats another thing that sil that sil were im at odds with with my vocnoiseparents 
were that they dont understand the fact that why would i go to college vocnoise 
i vocnoisepaid for it myself sil i worked my way through school vocnoise i was 
so proud the fact that i was like only a quarter late sil unknown than 
my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was 
paying for it sil as i went vocnoise and and i didnt have any loans 
i was when i was done it was vocnoisepaid for vocnoise and so um vocnoise 
course tuition was a hundred twenty five dollars a quarter but i was only making 
yknow fifty cents an hour at the beverly across the street on neil avenue vocnoise 
so um vocnoise sil uh but vocnoisebut anyhow yknow they vocnoisecould never understand yknow well 
you cutoffdididnt sil you never got a job with it sil yknow why would you 
go to school and waste all that money vocnoise cutoffi sil i it was the 
best money i ever spent iver i dont cutoffunderunderstand i mean and sil it was 
my money laughso why should it matter iver right sil well why do you have 
to do sil anything with it iver yeah iver yeah iver right but still vocnoise 
my cutoffjnamejulie my oldest daughter were for a long time she was errorithin sil in 
vocnoisetheater vocnoise and vocnoisepeople would say to me how do you feel about that and 
i said what do you mean how i feel about that sil yknow vocnoise she 
can always wait tables as long as she can vocnoisesupport herself vocnoise self what do 
i care vocnoise and then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology vocnoise 
and now as it turns out shes going to um sil vocnoise she just started 
back shes the one thats having the baby though vocnoise shes just started back cutofftto 
and uh sil to get certified to teach elementary sil school because weve vocnoise talked

really good with with kids maybe second third grade shes so into animals and so 
into vocnoise science and understands different kids vocnoise so that sil yknow i vocnoise i

if that if she cutoffjjust ends up not doing that sil i wont care either 
iver well we dont wanna know shes the only one that wants to know her 
her um boyfriend vocnoise vocnoisehe doesnt wanna know either and so sara decided that she 
could not go vocnoise and find out the sex of it because she couldnt keep 
a secret yeah so vocnoise so anyhow we dont we just dont know iver its

never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me iver really 
iver wow cutoffyiyou vocnoise yeah i know iver well i vocnoise believe me i know 
iver yeah iver right iver right iver my cutofffriefriend iver yeah because my friend has 
some place where she even teaches yoga and has shes real involved in it vocnoise 
that she goes to um vocnoise the one that i told you whos the realtor 
vocnoise but i should find out laughwhere that laughstudiois if i find out ill let 
you know vocnoise because i know she vocnoise she goes to some place called crapala 
in pennsylvania from time to time and vocnoise who knows vocnoise i just vocnoise i 
dont really do it for the meditation or anything iver i just do it for 
the stretching its almost like when im laying there and cutoffshshe and kathys saying vocnoise 
yknow take sil even though i sound speedy iver im really relaxed as much as 
weird as that might seem yknow and so for me thats like vocnoise okay come 
on vocnoise i dont really want i dont want time to do this kind of 
relaxing stuff vocnoise i just wanna get going and do the rest of this laughstuff 
so iver the part of it no vocnoise its takes about fifty minutes but to 
do all the stretching iver because see vocnoise well ive had five babies yknow i 
really have to work when you talked about that vocnoise the older you get vocnoise 
i have to work extreally really hard to vocnoise stay in halfway decent shape iver 
so iver but i love it iver cutoffai yeah i think it does vocnoise but 
vocnoise it vocnoise i like to exercise vocnoise i think its fun i would just 
do it four hours a day if i could do that vocnoise although i havent 
for the last vocnoise six weeks i havent done anything because its just ive had 
these other things that are cutoffrreally vocnoise that are really pressing vocnoise you know how 
that is you get you have some things you just have to get done vocnoise 
and then when i get this stuff cleared out sil therell be a break sil 
and then ill be able to go back to it iver vocnoise iver umhum iver 
oh wow iver that must be iver umhum iver oh iver right iver right iver 
yeah iver now who does he work for iver oh laugh vocnoise well i was 
because i was gonna say when you were talking about traveling vocnoise youll be able 
to get him to have cutoffs vocnoise a job where he can do lots of 
traveling vocnoise i know um like my husband goes to europe and vocnoise goes yknow 
he goes to california every month vocnoise and vocnoise and vocnoise yknow he goes as 
vocnoise little as possible vocnoise but the point is vocnoise if i cutoffwwanted vocnoise if 
we wanted to be traveling vocnoise he could be going a lot more vocnoise a 
lot longer now he just goes for vocnoise yknow a couple days vocnoise at a 
time just to get back here because i dont like him to have to cutoffgego 
well and he doesnt wanna be away from us vocnoise but erroryyour vocnoise your husband 
youll be in a position you can he can latch on to something where youll 
be able to have lots of opportunities to travel iver you will iver umhum iver 
umhum iver yeah iver right vocnoise right iver it is its iver right iver well 
i know with myself when we had vocnoise pete always says that vocnoise it wasnt 
for me he would have gotten just too immersed in his job because he is 
really involved yknow he likes what hes doing vocnoise he has tremendous responsibility and vocnoise 
but he loves it but the thing is vocnoise when the errorkidthkids were little too 
yknow i was always having to pull him back and say sil dont forget vocnoise 
yknow vocnoise theyre gonna grow up fast if you if you dont spend this time 
vocnoise and now vocnoise i mean sil like i said the youngest is thirteen and 
so hes been at this for all these years and vocnoise i dont have to 
do that anymore i mean vocnoise someplace along the way about ten years ago vocnoise 
he got so involved in their lives but when theyre little iver its a real 
different thing i mean you can understand why vocnoise itd be more pleasant for him 
to be at work all those hours extwhen yknow you have these little babies crying 
and all this stuff going on but vocnoise he used to always vocnoise he would 
come home from work vocnoise and then go back to work after they were in 
bed sil so that i wouldnt have to deal with it the whole time iver 
and work later then vocnoise which was fine by me vocnoise or hed call and 
hed say vocnoise is it okay if i work a little late cutofftonitonight would you 
care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice 
there are a lot of men that iver wouldnt even think about asking iver umhum 
iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah iver sure iver right iver right vocnoise oh and 
ive vocnoise and im sure it will vocnoise especially when you already recognize that vocnoise 
yknow erroriif if if you already know in advance what kinds of things youre gonna 
be sil uh helping along its a lot easier than sil trying to figure out 
whats going on here yknow iver uh huh iver yeah iver laugh iver right iver 
uh iver i vocnoise thats certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain 
sil doesnt laughworkinwaysthatother peoples do vocnoise so i think cutoffsosome vocnoise i think a lot 
of it too has to vocnoise to vocnoise do with being comfortable with yourself and 
knowing vocnoise yknow i mean ive gotten so much better over the years i was 
very vocnoise ive always been real sil cutoffllot vocnoise lot more temperamental vocnoise we always 
joke yknow that sil that predictable and vocnoise some of those things are not vocnoise 
um vocnoise even tempered are not things you would use to describe me unknown but 
vocnoise but cutoffnnot not in a negative vocnoise negative way yknow i just think that 
as ive gotten older too ive been able to see things and not be so 
vocnoise get so concerned about things that vocnoise that really werent that important anymore iver 
so vocnoise i dont know just lucky laugh iver i know i was thinking that 
before when you were telling me stuff iver yeah iver right iver yeah iver yeah 
iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah i cutoffdodont i yknow i think too 
i apologize to my oldest daughter sil laughalmost every day about the poor thing all 
i put her through when vocnoise we were trying to grow up together and i 
was twenty four when she was born so i wasnt a child vocnoise but its 
like vocnoise you dont have realistic expectations vocnoise of what vocnoise what children are capable 
of or what they can do because if theyre really verbal vocnoise and my kids 
always have been really verbal because ive talked to them from the moment they were 
born vocnoise even cutoffwhewhen yknow when they couldnt talk to me that was irrelevant vocnoise 
i was talking to them the whole cutoffttime obviously vocnoise see i dont shut up 
vocnoise so i would talk to them the whole time and vocnoise so they would 
always be really verbal and so it seemed like they cutoffwewere cutoffwwere vocnoise had a 
much better understanding and could do things better than vocnoise they really could like when 
my daughter was about five we got a hamster vocnoise and i said well yknow 
you make sure you give it food and water vocnoise and when it died it 
cutoffnnever vocnoise i was so surprised that she hadnt given him been giving it food 
and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you dont 
vocnoise yeah they dont get that stuff together vocnoise or when she was eleven we 
sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could 
cutofftto wait to buy something else well within vocnoise unknown three or four months it 
was gone yknow and so then the next year and a half she only had 
a mattress on the floor in her room because vocnoise but i mean now that 
was bizarre vocnoise now vocnoise with my other kids first of all i would have 
better sense than to do those things or i heswould vocnoise i would take more 
responsibility rather than expecting them to have it vocnoise and secondly vocnoise vocnoise if that 
happened sil i would be ten times more understanding and i would say vocnoise yknow 
i would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes iver 
vocnoise and vocnoise yeah vocnoise i yeah i shouldnt have done that so now lets 
just go get some more furniture laugh iver do you know what i mean vocnoise 
iver and and she always says oh mom it was fine she said vocnoise i 
got to do vocnoise a whole lot of things you wont let them do now 
laugh laughin laughexchange for that now that i know better vocnoise so cutoffeyits she shes 
always very generous about it and says she had more time alone with me and 
vocnoise because vocnoise i got divorced when she was or her vocnoise i split up 
with her dad when she was about a year and a half vocnoise and so 
for until she was six it was just she and i iver so we had 
a lot of time together and she says she thinks that was worth it iver 
it was okay to put up with my trying to learn how to be a 
parent vocnoise in exchange for having me all to herself iver laugh vocnoise iver vocnoise 
iver in a extstrange extcity i cutoffknoknow vocnoise oh my god iver vocnoise iver oh 
iver vocnoise well see vocnoise sil my cutofffafather my husband would do that though vocnoise 
its so bizarre because excludename is vocnoise i dont know whats vocnoise i cutoffddont vocnoise 
i honestly dont i think thats where his brain is completely lacking vocnoise sil i 
make i get to make sil all the decisions at my house about vocnoise discipline 
and about what people can do and cant do vocnoise and we vocnoise all understand 
this and its perfectly fine vocnoise and he says vocnoise im not a good judge 
of that vocnoise youll have to check cutoffwiwith because my son when my son was 
like eleven vocnoise he let him come to campus with his skateboarding friends i said 
where are they vocnoise oh they said they were going down on cutoffcacampus vocnoise i 
said vocnoise on campus vocnoise over my dead body laugh laughyknow hes not allowed down 
there vocnoise iver and so vocnoise cutoffiits its the thing is though vocnoise its almost 
like vocnoise im really glad that excludename willing to say vocnoise i just cant make 
those cutoffdedecisions uh hed let vocnoise hed let my daughter whos cutoffthirteethirteen he left vocnoise 
left her at the movies one night vocnoise they went to the movies there was 
no um vocnoise the movie they went to see was sold out vocnoise the next 
one wasnt gonna start until nine thirty which means this kids noisetwelve years old vocnoise 
so that would have been eleven thirty twelve cutoffowkoclock yknow vocnoise at the lennox he 
leaves her there with one of her friends vocnoise some boy vocnoise and sil although 
excludename this tomboy whos just amazing but so anyhow uh he left her there vocnoise 
and vocnoise uh unknown they said they called me but i cutoffdiydidnt i was running 
the sweeper so i didnt hear the phone vocnoise so excludename left her there and 
he said that she was gonna call back yknow at at a certain time and 
i was gonna tell her what she could or couldnt do vocnoise so i said 
yknow well youre gonna have to come cutoffhehere home yknow hes gonna have to come 
and get you oh come exton no vocnoise were not gonna do that i you 
know you cant be this late vocnoise so he went back down vocnoise picked them 
cutoffuup vocnoise and i said let the kid come to our house he can come 
here until eleven iver then his parents can pick him up vocnoise and everybody was 
annoyed my husband said vocnoise cutoffai vocnoise i wouldve let her stay i dont understand 
why youre doing this sil i dont care vocnoise i want her to come home 
vocnoise the other vocnoise well the bottom line it was hysterical because vocnoise she and 
this little boy theyre outside and he theyre jumping and hes jumping on the trampoline 
i go out to him and i introduce myself and i say yknow honey i 
said vocnoise really sorry about the plans but vocnoise i just you couldnt cutoffai vocnoise 
i just could not let you cutoffguyguys her stay there that long he goes vocnoise 
oh thats okay my mom would never let me do that vocnoise so and im 
thinking yknow vocnoise heres cutoffaall everybodys acting like im the bad guy vocnoise and vocnoise 
im im the one whos into vocnoise right vocnoise and so vocnoise there cutoffwwas i 
just wanna tell you one more thing that was funny because sil um there was 
something excludename she wanted to skip a play rehearsal that i wouldnt let her skip 
sil because vocnoise it was for a party that her friends were having vocnoise and 
i understood it was important to her but when you have commitments you cutoffjjust you 
keep your commitments vocnoise sil and so vocnoise excludename was saying he agreed with me 
and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case vocnoise she goes 
vocnoise so whats with him vocnoise he never has an opinion vocnoise how come all 
of a sudden hes allowed to have an opinion tell me what i can do 
yknow it was really funny vocnoise we laughed about it and vocnoise i let her 
um vocnoise i let her skip laughit laugh because i decided that it was so 
important to her iver so iver yeah vocnoise but it was just so funny yknow 
vocnoise i know we talked too long but this is so much fun iver laugh 
do you have a three oclock iver we gotta cutoffggo iver okay iver sil vocnoise 
iver ok iver umhum iver umhum iver great iver umhum iver sure sil um vocnoise 
i grew up in lima ohio sil vocnoise sil and which is only about an 
hour and half from here sil north sil vocnoise sil i came here in sil 
nineteen ninety one i believe sil vocnoise here being columbus sil vocnoise sil um i 
got married about three years ago sil and right now im in the process of 
sil vocnoise doing a little bit of everything ive worked all my life vocnoise um 
until about the sil past sil vocnoise two years vocnoise sil and ive just been 
working like part time sil and um doing crafts and things like that sil because 
ive always been like in the financial sil analytical end and sil vocnoise sil the 
other side of my brain wants some work iver sil so really thats about it 
i have a dog vocnoise sil hes outside right now and thats it sil for 
my kids iver yeah iver sil um really anything sil like right now im just 
painting and sil vocnoise sil um they laugh at me because i went the other 
day and found some chairs that were sil that sil badly vocnoise and asked if 
i could have them cleaned them up sil and im painting those and things like 
that sil so iver sil no iver no iver yeah sil i gave them to 
my sister and my mom and stuff like that sil so iver yeah vocnoise its 
kind of fun iver sil umhum sil iver yeah no thatd be neat id love 
to do that iver yeah iver right sil yeah sil that would be fun iver 
vocnoise sil im looking for a part time job as we speak ive been like 
doing temporary on and off vocnoise sil and the thing with that is you could 
work sil yknow for four five months and then nothing sil and then vocnoise sil 
just sil like that so right now im looking for something permanent iver uh mostly 
accounting sil things like that uh such as accounts receivable for nursing homes and vocnoise 
things like that pretty in depth vocnoise sil um sil some of the day by 
yknow if i just go for a day its filing and what not getting phones 
vocnoise but most of the jobs actually sil you learn a lot sil so iver 
vocnoise sil boy it would have to be sil um something that i actually enjoy 
sil vocnoise sil um cutoffwwhat cutoffwwhat sil what happened was ever since i came to 
columbus vocnoise almost every company i work for was bought out and sold and moved 
to a different state vocnoise sil and i wasnt interested in that sil uh because 
my husband works for the state vocnoise so obviously hes not going anywhere vocnoise sil 
um sil so i got tired of that and thats why i kind of went 
to temping and stuff vocnoise sil so itd be one with a variety sil vocnoise 
um sil im cutoffunfortunfortunately i say unfortunately good at accounting and stuff vocnoise but that 
doesnt get to express my creative side as much so sil vocnoise sil it would 
be um sil my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i 
dealt with people as well vocnoise and like sil would do presentations at seminars and 
stuff like that occasionally too sil so sil vocnoise right iver just a teeny bit 
iver enough to satisfy me vocnoise so that was good iver vocnoise yeah i do 
iver vocnoise sil um i prefer sil ive done it by myself but i would 
errorpfprefer prefer to do it with my husband vocnoise sil and stuff iver vocnoise europe 
iver vocnoise i was there for almost a month vocnoise did one of those tours 
where you get on the bus sil um sil vocnoise and did the london and 
the france the and italy and to holland and iver vocnoise germany and everything sil 
that was really neat iver vocnoise right sil yeah sil yeah sil thats very true 
iver vocnoise sil we havent done that much yet uh because his family lives in 
albuquerque new mexico iver vocnoise were sil at cutoffaat at least every other year were 
out there iver which is great iver but it takes away that big trip sil 
vocnoise um weve been and then his brother got married in hawaii sil vocnoise so 
we went out there so sil weve just done the honeymoon at disney world vocnoise 
sil the albuquerque a couple times and hawaii sil vocnoise but we have plans to 
go to europe he he wants to go to england and sil vocnoise things like 
that and i wanna were looking into greece iver so iver sil yes iver vocnoise 
sil uh actually kawai sil yeah so it was really nice sil vocnoise i thought 
it vocnoise course i didnt go to all of them but sil it was nice 
iver yeah sil and it it has the least amount of people sil which is 
kind of neat sil as far as tourism sil so iver yeah sil vocnoise it 
was vocnoise sil its not bothering me but when i talk and move my head 
iver its like hitting me and i just am not sure you can tell me 
if its not sil vocnoise anywhere near my mouth iver sil so iver yeah sil 
its i keep it wasnt sil but then it moved so sil well sil there 
we go iver sil yeah iver vocnoise sil hilliard iver umhum iver vocnoise i like 
it vocnoise sil um sil ive lived vocnoise ive only lived in the northern end 
ive lived in dublin sil vocnoise sil and old worthington vocnoise and now hilliard which 
is kind of around the side vocnoise sil um but i like it because it 
has its own little sil vocnoise sil well especially worthington its own little city within 
a city iver vocnoise sil and um sil i think they have a lot to 
do sil yknow the parks and things like that sil vocnoise sil so sil um 
sil ill just hold it sil vocnoise sil vocnoise but i like it sil vocnoise 
because it has art sil and culture sil and um sil vocnoise it doesnt feel 
like a big city iver unless you get stuck in traffic iver so iver yeah 
sil yeah but i cutoffbubut sil i have sil purposely tried to work close vocnoise 
sil or do the back roads its nice from hilliard you can get almost anywhere 
vocnoise sil whether it be here sil vocnoise sil or yknow where ive been working 
sil on back roads so its not that bad sil vocnoise iver umhum iver yes 
iver yeah iver right iver the snouffer and all that sil yep iver i used 
to live up there too iver so sil vocnoise iver very much so iver yeah 
iver i think this year its gonna be even worse sil stocking up sil water 
sil laughno iver right iver yeah iver umhum iver yes sil iver vocnoise iver yes 
iver yes iver vocnoise really sil i havent noticed that sil vocnoise sil yet sil 
huh iver vocnoise iver laugh iver vocnoise iver yeah sil yeah sil vocnoise iver vocnoise 
i think its probably too though that a lot of people havent sil arent used 
to it sil i mean theyre not from ohio vocnoise ive cutoffffound sil found that 
in columbus a lot sil so theyre kind of sil vocnoise yknow more tentative or 
theyre from the south or something like that sil so sil vocnoise sil they sil 
vocnoise sil and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio 
but sil ive noticed that a lot of people sil rarely do you meet people 
born and raised in columbus sil so iver umhum iver umhum iver huh iver thats 
good sil vocnoise sil no not really actually sil cutoffsosome some i have and then 
ive run into the people that sil just like anything they wanna get out of 
their hometown they dont like it they complain vocnoise but normally i find that those 
people sil arent taking advantage of vocnoise sil the sil yknow free art shows and 
vocnoise sil yknow i mean the things that are free im like oh have you 
done this vocnoise sil no i didnt even know about it and youve lived here 
all your life and ive only lived here x number of years and iver vocnoise 
so iver sil um sil well just even like the sil parks iver or um 
vocnoise sil like the sil art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the 
the irish festival in dublin vocnoise which can be free yeah on certain days and 
things like that sil vocnoise sil um vocnoise the concerts on the river sil or 
on the worthington sil green sil vocnoise sil really anything like that iver and they 
used to have the laser light show downtown sil vocnoise cutoffthethey they dont have it 
anymore sil um yknow just even if you do one thing free a month vocnoise 
iver it sil it doesnt have to cost anything but you sil you can go 
do it with your family or whatever so sil yeah iver sil iver umhum iver 
yeah laugh iver vocnoise laughididnt sil vocnoise no my husband yeah hes uh hes from 
she can wear a bandanna but thats it laugh vocnoise and i yknow i would 
love to do that with her only on things like that i wouldnt be the 
type that would put a sweater on her on tuesday and a little skirt on

sil um sil she iver vocnoise yes sil um noise were both sil ive gotten

um weve taken her to the scioto part iver for the concert on the river 
vocnoise we dont tend to take her to things like the art festival or the 
its just too crowded iver and its not fair to her or the other people 
iver uh because she has been known to help herself to bread sil laugh laughwhen 
vocnoise we were like brain dead after this race and my husband took her and 
we know better but sil we were like sil yknow after you run youre kind 
of like uh vocnoise and she laughactually noise jumped up on the table and looked

vocnoise um since i do like to jog even though im very slow vocnoise most 
of the people that take their dogs there sil take them off the leash and 
let them go in the lake and what not vocnoise which is vocnoise extokay youre 
not supposed to do that but when im jogging with my dog on a leash 
and all the other dogs come up it sil irritates me iver because yknow youre 
trying to run and your dogs trying to greet that dog and the dogs tripping

one following the rules around here unknown laugh sil because im trying to run sil

couch and shes sil like sil vocnoise vocnoise im caught laugh laughitshilarious vocnoise iver yeah 
iver vocnoise oh we have fun laugh iver laugh iver anybody see that laugh iver 
ours does that too vocnoise theyre great iver sounds a lot like our dog iver 
yeah my sister vocnoise and her husband just moved back they went out to nebraska 
for a year iver laugh and then yeah i got the opportunity um vocnoise cutoffaa 
vocnoise a company that my sister had worked for wanted her to come back iver 
and so they offered to move them back iver and um sil it kind of 
worked out because her husband was losing his job any how vocnoise just kind of 
one of those okay lets do it iver and so sil um my parents retired 
here vocnoise lets see vocnoise theyve been here vocnoise i dont know four or five 
years maybe iver and my sister was here vocnoise like i said and then moved 
out just gotten vocnoise came back a couple months ago vocnoise um sil my grandfather 
just passed away but he was here vocnoise in a nursing home for about a 
year iver um iver indirectly vocnoise yes iver um the cutoffrreason sil my sister was 
here only iver when i got here vocnoise but i was in cutoffd one of 
those yknow youth vocnoise stupid uh psychopathic relationships shall we say vocnoise and i kind 
of needed to disappear vocnoise and um vocnoise uh we never told him where cutoffshshe 
she had just moved iver um vocnoise so i just came down here then iver 
so sil was one of those iver things vocnoise get away from it all yeah 
vocnoise yeah so um i came down here vocnoise because he knew where my parents 
lived and plus columbus was a lot more opportunity iver so indirectly it was a 
very bad reason that i came here vocnoise but vocnoise it worked out iver yknow 
so iver right iver exactly iver oh laugh iver umhum vocnoise well i even had 
that iver i mean my cutoffffamily vocnoise oh my sister said if you didnt leave 
him i was gonna staple your hair to the laughwall laughunknown but um she was 
cutoffjojoking she wasnt kidding though vocnoise cutoffbecaubecause yknow its just one of cutoffthothose oh i 
can help him yknow ive learned im the caretaker vocnoise like i roll my eyes 
laughbecauseitslike vocnoise you cant change people that much stupid vocnoise but um vocnoise cutoffyyknow vocnoise 
its weird because it was terrible vocnoise but because he was real controlling and yknow 
you start to doubt yourself like vocnoise did i say that vocnoise right and like 
he wouldnt let me sleep so then you start to lose that vocnoise yknow what 
i mean cutoffyyou cutoffrealreally you cutoffsstart really do start to lose your mental iver yeah 
laugh woo vocnoise and um vocnoise um vocnoise yknow at the time i was like 
im not gonna get anything out of this and it was misery and vocnoiseugh vocnoise 
what not but vocnoise ive met people that have been in vocnoise much worse situations 
vocnoise and at least i can kind of relate to them iver so in a 
cutoffwway in one way its kind of a blessing iver so iver yeah iver umhum 
iver laugh iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah iver umhum iver yeah iver oh yeah 
iver yeah iver vocnoise yeah sil its very cutoffffortunatefrustrating vocnoise i my sister vocnoise has 
an undergrad in psychology vocnoise and she worked at like um vocnoise one of those 
vocnoise what do you call them those secretive houses like for women and their battered 
children that sil yknow youre not supposed to unknown location and what not vocnoise and 
she used to get so frustrated um vocnoise because theyd always go back iver and 
sil i understand that mentality now because i went back but ill tell you the 
reason i left laughwas vocnoise cutoffststupid laughitsgonna sound stupid but vocnoise he took my teddy 
bear vocnoise which i loved and errorived had for vocnoise not since i was a 
child but at least five years at that time vocnoise and he just vocnoise he 
knew i loved it iver and just took it and ripped it iver and and 
sil that split second i was like sil okay hes gonna do this to me 
hes gonna do this to my kids iver aint no way iver laughyknow laugh iver 
laugh iver umhum iver wow iver laugh iver umhum iver yeah iver it is iver 
thats important iver right vocnoise even though its an inanimate object it all kind of 
came together iver right iver and i was glad i realized that i vocnoise nobody 
would ever mess with my children vocnoise not even vocnoise their father my husband or 
whatever iver and i realized that so it was like ok vocnoise im not gonna 
do it for me but vocnoise im gonna do it vocnoise for the future vocnoise 
and and that helped iver because like i said it all came together because i 
dont understand how people can let their kids be hurt sil but iver im vocnoise 
im not built that way iver yeah vocnoise yeah iver um iver umhum iver umhum 
iver yeah iver sure iver yeah sil yeah iver umhum sil umhum vocnoise yeah its 
always kind of scary vocnoise i think you really need to get away from that 
vocnoise to get your self back iver or youre just gonna go back because you 
dont know any other way at the time iver umhum iver yeah iver right sil 
right vocnoise but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared vocnoise doing 
a little bit of reading going wait a minute yknow uh laugh laughits so obvious 
hello laugh vocnoise but laugh oh yeah iver but just that freedom vocnoise yknow to 
do what you want to get some sleep to sil eat to take care of 
yourself vocnoise to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what 
not vocnoise and then its really clear but if you dont get that vocnoise and 
youre always thrust back into it vocnoise i dont think you can break free iver 
so iver yeah iver thats true iver yeah iver umhum iver yeah vocnoise yeah iver 
yeah iver yeah iver umhum iver umhum iver vocnoise um vocnoise no vocnoise which is 
im very grateful vocnoise he did like go past my errorharenparents vocnoise parents house and 
things like that vocnoise but then they moved here vocnoise and even though its public 
records like who owns a house vocnoise um vocnoise luckily we havent had that because 
vocnoise we purchased the house vocnoise my husband and i noise before we were married 
and then moved in after we were married so the deed has my maiden name 
on it vocnoise but uh no luckily iver and thats been vocnoise almost ten years 
vocnoise so hopefully iver hopefully iver no vocnoise id just uh basically got out of 
a cutoffn vocnoise a vocnoise a relationship sil it was like a rebound type thing 
vocnoise um i was in a relationship for like three years vocnoise and um vocnoise 
he was cheating on me vocnoise and so i felt really bad and why does 
he pick her and vocnoise and then i met this guy who seemed vocnoise wonderful 
vocnoise and then vocnoise turned out vocnoise to be not so wonderful iver so vocnoise 
i made a laughlotofstupid yknow you look back and you see things you were like 
this is real obvious vocnoise but at the time i think you cutofff vocnoise i 
was like sil um vocnoise a i can either change them vocnoise or vocnoise if 
they love me vocnoise we can communicate vocnoise and change things and yknow sil that 
type of thing iver yeah laugh right vocnoise laughum laugh first of all theyre not 
really in love with you and laughsecondlyyourewrong laugh vocnoise so when i came here vocnoise 
um i didnt date iver for over five years sil on purpose vocnoise i dont 
think it was supposed to be that long on purpose but i wouldnt let myself 
date for a couple years after just trying to figure out iver yknow okay vocnoise 
this is what im doing wrong lets not do it again vocnoisedidididideh vocnoise and then 
laughnobody asked me out for a few more laughyearsso iver yeah laugh vocnoise so that 
laughworkedout vocnoise uh so i really hadnt dated for a long time and then i 
started dating again vocnoise and whats weird is you almost go right back in vocnoise 
to the patterns because youre so scared youre gonna be alone you see yourself going 
sil oh i can be with this person and you know in your head laugh 
this laughpersons not for extyou vocnoise and then luckily vocnoise um indirectly i met my 
husband iver four vocnoise four years ago i dont know its been awhile vocnoise four 
and a half years ago something like that iver so vocnoise yeah iver yeah iver 
right vocnoise yeah it was like oh this makes sense and he might have these 
other wonderful vocnoise things that im used to but hes got all of laughthis laugh 
vocnoise so ill get that little slice and take the laughrest vocnoise so that worked 
out iver um iver um vocnoise actually i think it needs to probably start younger 
than that vocnoise because vocnoise i cutoffn vocnoise exti didnt sil start dating until i 
was almost seventeen vocnoise but almost everybody else cutoffststarted vocnoise had vocnoise even vocnoise im 
gonna be thirty six here in a week or two vocnoise so were laughtalking i 
graduated in eighty exttwo vocnoise where extnow vocnoise cutoffkkids i think kids are cutoffsstarting dating 
at sil like vocnoise ten laugheleven laughtwelve iver vocnoise heaven forbid vocnoise but laugh im 
sitting here going vocnoise i mean vocnoise i didnt even know what i was doing 
iver when i started dating at sil almost seventeen vocnoise um sil so no i 
think vocnoise i think you learn a lot from your family vocnoise and the way 
their relationships are vocnoise um vocnoise i vocnoise i personally dont think a school can 
do it iver um vocnoise i think they can help vocnoise but i think it 
has to be something that vocnoise society in general or family iver unit does it 
vocnoise um and it wasnt that i had a bad family unit it was just 
that vocnoise there wasnt yknow we never talked about it vocnoise my laughsisterandi were just 
talking about that because noisewewere vocnoise she goes vocnoise we were like cutoffw vocnoise yknow 
how did people start talking about sil extsex and relationships and what not she goes 
vocnoise you dont cutoffmemremember mom and dad handed me a book vocnoise im like they 
did iver vocnoise im like i dont remember that iver and she goes well after 
i read the book i asked them a lot of questions so maybe they didnt 
give it to laughyou laugh yknow like how we dont wanna go through this again 
vocnoise because shes a little laugholderthanme vocnoise i thought that was hilarious iver vocnoise iver 
like vocnoise you mean sexual relationships and what vocnoise um vocnoise probably the cutoffr vocnoise 
the bad things about it vocnoise yeah vocnoise um but just coming from my christian 
beliefs and what not vocnoise the best thing and i know it sil even though 
i didnt partake in it when i was a teenager and i wasnt promiscuous at 
all vocnoise but i still had sex before marriage vocnoise um vocnoise just to be 
vocnoise itd be nice if they teach you how to be confident in your self 
vocnoise and i dont mean like self esteem but vocnoise yknow like sil we said 
if if uh vocnoise yknow you come from a situation like that that doesnt mean 
you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of iver 
vocnoise yeah vocnoise iver right vocnoise well kind of like vocnoise just because everybody else 
is doing it this way doesnt mean its the right extway vocnoise and um vocnoise 
cutoffii yeah vocnoise cutoffii vocnoise yknow i really struggle with that vocnoise because vocnoisei sil 
i come more from i think the family should teach it vocnoise but lets be 
realistic how many families are gonna do that vocnoise or vocnoise have the vocnoise mentality 
to do that sil it seems like um vocnoise laugh vocnoise sound like my dad 
laughbutitseems like these days vocnoise most of the people a lot of people that are 
having kids vocnoise shouldnt be iver and the people that vocnoise would be decent parent 
arent vocnoise because of the vocnoise situations and what not vocnoise um just my cutofffamfamily 
sil nobody in my cutofffamfamily my sister doesnt have kids i dont have kids vocnoise 
were in our mid to late thirties vocnoise um our friends just had one vocnoise 
um i do have some friends that have vocnoise like more than one vocnoise which 
is great vocnoise because theyre just great parents ill know those kids are gonna be 
going in vocnoise but then sil i have uh other people that vocnoise like my 
other friends that just had one vocnoise were trying to help a a child errorninin 
children services vocnoise that came from vocnoise unknown iver vocnoise yknow vocnoise imagine it and 
thats basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids vocnoise by three 
different dads vocnoise and they thought if they could get her out of that environment 
they actually vocnoise had her move in with them vocnoise they were her temporary foster 
parents vocnoise and vocnoise she just turned sixteen vocnoise so she was fifteen when she 
moved in with them vocnoise she refused to change vocnoise and vocnoise i dont know 
what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier vocnoise but 
basically vocnoise all three of them vocnoise i dont wanna say are doomed but vocnoise 
theyre not sil even though theyre out of that environment vocnoise theyre not doing any 
better iver so iver vocnoise i dont know vocnoise yeah so its kind of like 
vocnoise im for education in schools but sil um vocnoise just like the bad things 
about it yknow sil sex can do vocnoise you can get pregnant number one iver 
which isnt fun vocnoise laughand number two yknow the diseases and things like that vocnoise 
i think thats a good idea vocnoise to teach just sil that its not all 
vocnoise uh fun and peer pressure and stuff i know i kind of got off 
track there but vocnoise iver hum iver no vocnoise because theyre gonna learn that on 
their own vocnoise um vocnoise cutoffai vocnoise i personally think that its a choice sil 
i dont think youre born that way vocnoise because cutoffai i vocnoise i have friends 
vocnoise that are homosexual and vocnoise um vocnoise yknow cutoffwa i dont believe in what 
theyre doing but vocnoise laughidont do everything right everyday vocnoise so i still love them 
and theyre my friends and blah blah blah because vocnoise but ive also known people 
that vocnoise were that way vocnoise and now are heterosexual and are much happier vocnoise 
and they realize that it was just a choice they made and things like that 
vocnoise um vocnoise so its vocnoise vocnoise in todays day and age theyre gonna learn 
about it vocnoise quickly iver and i dont really think its something that needs to 
be taught vocnoise um vocnoise the only thing vocnoise probably vocnoise is like vocnoise what 
do they call that uh vocnoise cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take 
i think vocnoise that i dont think is such a bad idea vocnoise uh because 
just because you grew up in vocnoise i dont know vocnoise what i grew up 
in but ill ill give an example i didnt grow up in lets say vocnoise 
somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to 
country music vocnoise doesnt mean if somebody doesnt do that vocnoise theyre not okay vocnoise 
i think that would be a good idea or yknow cultures all are different vocnoise 
so if you wanted to view that as a culture or vocnoise do yknow what 
i mean vocnoise that that vocnoise is something different vocnoise um vocnoise accept the people 
you dont have to like what theyre doing vocnoise but theyre still people vocnoise so 
iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah vocnoise um vocnoise yeah vocnoise i vocnoise its hard 
because i i do come cutoffaacross vocnoise im a christian vocnoise so i believe that 
homosexuality is wrong vocnoise but vocnoise i dont like i said im not gonna condemn 
them vocnoise um at all vocnoise like i said i have friends vocnoise it vocnoise 
i understand what youre saying vocnoise um vocnoise but i think thats something more for 
vocnoise the parents vocnoise or the teacher to pick out vocnoise that maybe that child 
vocnoise um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort 
vocnoise and not actually incorporate it sil in a vocnoise thirty student vocnoise ensemble vocnoise 
um vocnoise uh itd be nice if we had more of an open environment in 
schools and if teachers really had the time vocnoise to notice that maybe somebody had 
a problem and talk to them about it vocnoise and then send them on that 
counseling vocnoise one on one way vocnoise um vocnoise just because vocnoise if youre gonna 
teach it to um a large amount of vocnoise students vocnoise im not even sure 
if that one cutoffsh student would listen because all the rest of them errorwundwould probably 
be making cracks and just make them feel extmore vocnoise do you know what i 
mean vocnoise extso i dont cutoffffeel iver laugh vocnoise yeah laugh iver extso exti yknow 
they probably all hey you resemble that remark or laughynknow iver vocnoise cutoffii so i 
hesitate to say that it would really help them sil um it would just be 
better if somebody could vocnoise yknow keep their eyes open vocnoise or if we exthad 
vocnoise um vocnoise more counselors or things like that to deal with everything vocnoise including 
that iver normally i would say no vocnoise but vocnoise yeah vocnoise i do vocnoise 
just because vocnoise lets face it sil laughtheyreprobablygonna do it anyhow vocnoise and i would 
feel better for them sil and if cutoffiif sil if they used it because vocnoise 
uh vocnoise yknow sil its not good for the children that are born its not 
good for them vocnoise um vocnoise id prefer abstinence but lets be realistic vocnoise yknow 
i think were past that point now vocnoise um i know a lot of christians 
argue oh but youre wrong vocnoise well yeah i might be wrong but vocnoise yknow 
vocnoise laughwe vocnoise we cant go backwards on that i dont think vocnoise you can 
only work on your own iver its iver right iver cutoffeh vocnoise cutoffeh iver is 
not gonna work iver right iver even though i knew better at the point sil 
when i vocnoise was faced with that at seventeen or whatever vocnoise i wanted to 
be errordlovedloved so bad that it was something that vocnoise i vocnoise yknow what i 
mean vocnoise and i knew better but you just yknow vocnoise and its like well 
vocnoise i wasnt that strong granted but vocnoise i was probably cutoffm vocnoise the cutoffmmost 
normal teen and vocnoise i think most of the people i knew at that age 
vocnoise were vocnoise lost it much younger than seventeen vocnoise yknow vocnoise ok laugh eleven 
twelve its like ew he we even look alike laugh forget it vocnoise but vocnoise 
um vocnoise yeah so i think i think birth control would be good sil and 
vocnoise vocnoise its weird i i wish they would make it vocnoise i dont wanna 
say cutofffrfree well i think they do make it free vocnoise um and i hate 
to say it but a little bit easier access vocnoise um sil because vocnoise i 
dont think itll cause people to have more sex i think theyre gonna have it 
anyhow vocnoise so it would only be better vocnoise and safer for them iver yeah 
iver umhum iver umhum iver the shot iver okay iver umhum iver okay iver umhum 
iver umhum iver laugh iver laugh vocnoise yknow vocnoise we cutoffwwere my husband and i 
were just talking about this vocnoise i was saying im not in for the vocnoise 
yknow george orwell nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all vocnoise um vocnoise 
my ideal situation would be vocnoise that sil somebody decides who should have kids and 
whos not but i dont think gods gonna come down and do that sil laughsowellyknowwhatimean 
sil we cant really decide that vocnoise but vocnoise sil to be honest vocnoise im 
for it vocnoise um sil it doesnt have to be well im not even sure 
tubes tied is vocnoise is pretty sil permanent vocnoise um sil but sil even if 
they could do something like on a yearly basis vocnoise and give them two hundred 
dollars a year vocnoise thats still not still much cheaper than them having kids vocnoise 
um sil and then if they cutoffwwould sil id give more money if theyd clean 
up their act vocnoise just for them vocnoise um vocnoise as far as it being 
racist i dont think i think theyre missing the cutoffppoint sil the point vocnoise because 
im sure theres some runaway white sil teenage girls out there too vocnoise or mexican 
or what not sil um iver think the point is theyre on drugs yknow and 
i dont sil yeah sil im not sil i dont consider myself racist at all 
sil it is laughunfortunate that thats whats happening but vocnoise its just one of those 
things that you hate to say yeah im for it because you sound like vocnoise 
its like sil everything is specific sil and vocnoise permanent vocnoise yeah i kind of 
have a problem with that sil um because they might change their mind vocnoise but 
then again they can always adopt vocnoise yknow and vocnoise i kind of look at 
it that way theres enough kids out there that sil need love and iver you 
dont sil yeah vocnoise yeah iver umhum iver yeah iver umhum iver yeah iver yeah 
vocnoise which cracks me up because if youve ever looked at the parents of models 
theyre not necessarily all that laughattractive laugh vocnoise laughyeah laugh iver laugh laughyeah laugh vocnoise 
laugh vocnoise yeah extthats iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah vocnoise i know iver yeah 
sil i do too iver umhum iver laugh um sil not to sound like a 
broken record but i really think its sil our uh vocnoise backslide on vocnoise on 
family units vocnoise i think its too easy to stay vocnoise cutoffii and ive been 
married and divorced so ive vocnoise unfortunately had that experience to me vocnoise um vocnoise 
that vocnoise its too easy to get divorced vocnoise um people dont really go into 
marriage with commitment sil and lifetime vocnoise and have that sil i dont wanna say 
old fashioned values but just the value of this is very important vocnoise um because 
lets face it vocnoise to sil to me love is a choice vocnoise because theres 
times when i dont love my husband i wanna smack him and hes being a 
little barney vocnoise but i choose to be in love with him because i made 
that choice and then that passes vocnoise and lo and behold an hour later week 
later what cutoffhahappens laughwhateverlongit takes vocnoise im in love with him again vocnoise i mean 
really vocnoise yknow what im saying vocnoise and um vocnoise i think its just too 
easy to get divorced vocnoise i dont believe in staying in a marriage for the 
sake of a just children vocnoise but i think if you really make that commitment 
and vocnoise actually work on it vocnoise you can have a great relationship you can 
cutoffhhave have kids vocnoise and bring them up in sil a more stable environment vocnoise 
um sil unfortunately i think thats vocnoise the problem vocnoise parents vocnoise um are sil 
a either getting divorced vocnoise and then they get caught up in their petty little 
things and start pitting the kids against each other vocnoise yknow using the kid as 
a medium vocnoise um vocnoise or vocnoise theyre too selfish and dont listen to their 
kids or they didnt vocnoise i vocnoise i dont wanna say selfish but lets face 
it like we said yknow even having a dog takes some time out of your 
cutoffsschedule sil your cutoffsschedule vocnoise your schedule vocnoise and um vocnoise not spend enough time 
with the kids vocnoise yknow theyre working what not sil and it takes a lot 
of effort vocnoise to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get 
to know them vocnoise and let them grow and things like that vocnoise uh vocnoise 
and i dont think sil enough sil families are doing that iver um vocnoise i 
think cutoffih sil uh some of it was that i think a lot of it 
is you do feel lonely vocnoise um you do go through a period in your 
life sil where vocnoise you dont feel like you have any friends or vocnoise you 
feel totally different vocnoise i mean i laughstillgo through that i think we all go 
through that at some point or other vocnoise even yearly for some of us vocnoise 
um vocnoise so sil im just saying if he felt like he could go to 
somebody vocnoise either in his family vocnoise i say he cutoffkcausebecause using those for example 
vocnoise or vocnoise the parents paid a little bit more attention and didnt have that 
blind eye vocnoise i think thats part of your responsibility as a parent that vocnoise 
if you see something potentially evil or wrongdoing in your vocnoise childs eyes vocnoise you 
need to really admit it vocnoise um vocnoise i mean you dont wanna do that 
sil but iver yeah iver yeah iver and his mom even signed for stuff i 
think iver yeah i mean yknow laugh signing vocnoise oh here you go hun laugh 
vocnoise um sil cutoffyyou the one vocnoise i think is pretty obvious sil that sil 
the blind eye was something that shouldnt have happened vocnoise the other one vocnoise that 
yeah sil you just vocnoise lets face it at that age and at every age 
we want a leader vocnoise um vocnoise and sil i guess it goes back if 
we choose vocnoise to cutoffoor or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves 
well make better decisions of whos gonna lead us vocnoise so vocnoise i dont know 
i cutoffrreally vocnoise the cutoffb i think a lot of its the family unit breaking 
down vocnoise in general vocnoise yknow vocnoise and secondly i think to be honest i 
think the medias gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it vocnoise um vocnoise and 
i do think cutoffo vocnoise yknow they know theyre gonna get recognized theyre gonna have 
their name go down in history vocnoise unfortunately sil um vocnoise i think that has 
something to do with it too vocnoise um its frustrating to turn on the news 
they dont really cover vocnoise my husband comes from a journalistic background and hell be 
like laugh thats not news vocnoise yknow what i mean its just sil we get 
so ah sil lets sit here and watch a plane crash for twelve hours vocnoise 
instead of watching vocnoise i dont know what laugh little house on the prairie laughidontknowbut 
laugh laughimbeingfacetiousbutyknowwhatimean iver oh yeah iver right iver right sil and just going over it 
and over it and over it iver then you get the shooting out in honolulu 
and the next day theres another one vocnoise its just kind of like vocnoise that 
syndrome yknow well at least i can be popular for fifteen minutes or whatever vocnoise 
um vocnoise i mean im not saying not to cover it sil but vocnoise yeah 
vocnoise and then course you have the whole gun control stuff thats just vocnoise ridiculous 
laugh iver vocnoise um i think they might have tried any how but obviously they 
wouldnt have been as sil uh sil good at it sil or sil yknow what 
im trying to say it wouldnt have cutoffbbeen been as much distraction sil because obviously 
the bombs sil is something but to sil actually have that sil right there sil 
i mean have the access and what not i mean sil i guess the grandparents 
had the house sil locked sil and they broke in but just the fact that 
they were there and they knew cutoffth how to use them and sil uh that 
scares me sil because sil vocnoise sil the problem with guns in my opinion is 
you dont have to think to use it vocnoise it takes yknow you dont have 
to sit there and load it and sil vocnoise in a split second sil i 
think we cutoffwwe sil all are capable of shooting somebody sil for whatever reason sil 
vocnoise yknow just stupidity or whatnot sil i dont vocnoise just in a split second 
sil yknow sil we we might have that once in a life where we can 
kill somebody that quickly sil vocnoise and you cant go sil oh sil yknow iver 
i didnt mean to do that yeah iver iver laugh well exactly vocnoise i mean 
there are split seconds where you just wanna shoot somebody unfortunately vocnoise anybody that says 
that sil i i mean im sil i dont even like stepping on ants sil 
vocnoise but theres those moments where youre like sil vocnoise iver yeah iver yeah sil 
vocnoise and sil yeah so i vocnoise iver no iver vocnoise iver no iver vocnoise 
yeah unfortunately vocnoise well some people have to sil i mean yknow the police erroroffersofficers 
and what not theyre required to carry a gun sil but sil vocnoise sil um 
vocnoise almost every kid i know that cutoffhhashad sil has had a cutoffgugun even if 
they keep a gun vocnoise sil unknownoh vocnoise hidden here and the bullets hidden over 
here vocnoise iver they find out a way to get to them sil and um 
sil i dated a guy where vocnoise we came in on his little brother and 
he was loading the bullets in the gun sil vocnoise and he had them cutoffttotally 
totally separate sil like that sil and sil vocnoise sil heskids kids know and theyre 
curious vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil vocnoise sil i dont know vocnoise i i mean 
im not for guns because ive sil i sil they cutoffsscare sil vocnoise sil the 
guns dont scare me the people unknown laughscareme sil vocnoise so vocnoise sil vocnoise sil 
no vocnoise unless they have them in a safe or something vocnoise cutoffththey sil and 
cutoffmmy vocnoise i just sil vocnoise sil vocnoise that protection like they said normally you 
use it against somebody you didnt mean to use it on sil vocnoise sil and 
errorevfevenifconflated somebody else comes into your house with a gun lets face it sil are 
you gonna have the peace of mind to go get it sil vocnoise id rather 
just have a bat by my door or something vocnoise sil um sil so sil 
vocnoise iver umhum iver vocnoise iver umhum iver no thank goodness or if i did 
i sil blanked it out laugh iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver umhum iver vocnoise yeah 
sil vocnoise yeah iver right iver umhum iver umhum iver vocnoise sil yeah iver vocnoise 
sil vocnoise iver vocnoise iver umhum iver umhum iver vocnoise well sil vocnoise sil cutoffththeyorthe 
cutoffii sil yeah sil but lets face it the people that have the real good 
guns are the laughpeoplethatshouldnthavetheguns sil vocnoise meaning crime and whatnot sil um sil vocnoise sil 
i sil dont have a problem with people having guns sil but sil we dont 
need sil vocnoise sil sixty guns per person or whatever the ratio is its something 
ungodly like that vocnoise sil and they keep making them and sil cutoffii sil vocnoise 
sil vocnoise sil mean yeah there was a time it was a part of our 
culture we did need to hunt to eat sil vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise i 
have friends that bow and arrow hunt sil vocnoise sil im not real big into 
hunting but at least sil theyre sil they have to do something besides sit there 
and laugh iver vocnoise sil vocnoise sil um plus if they shoot somebody accidentally sil 
number one its really hard to sil vocnoise sil and secondly it probably wont kill 
them like a gun can sil vocnoise sil um sil and you have to use 
your brain sil vocnoise so sil vocnoise i didnt come from a hunting sil background 
sil vocnoise sil um sil but sil my husband does work for the state highway 
patrol so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns sil 
vocnoise sil but none of them sil hardly any of them sil hunt sil vocnoise 
sil um sil and a lot of them sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil they respect 
them sil if yknow what i mean they realize they can kill people sil we 
do get some of the sil yknow sil machismo people that just wanna go out 
and shoot sil things and sil vocnoise sil vocnoise yeah sil vocnoise sil yeah vocnoise 
sil i sil cutoffii sil yeah i dont sil vocnoise sil its not the guns 
thats the problem its the people sil that are teaching iver umhum iver laugh iver 
vocnoise iver vocnoise oh exactly im planning on just staying in the house if i 
can sil vocnoise or whatnot cutoffyeyeah oh yeah vocnoise yeah sil i know i mean 
were gonna get some water and whatnot because you dont know people might turn things 
off like you said iver vocnoise sil so sil yeah i think um sil vocnoise 
sil as a whole weve all vocnoise kind of gone our separate ways sil vocnoise 
sil which is scary vocnoise sil vocnoise sil mean we dont have the same belief 
system in anything anymore so its kind of like oh geez laugh iver vocnoise sil 
vocnoise definitely vocnoise definitely iver vocnoise iver vocnoise sil vocnoise sil vocnoise um vocnoise i 
havent personally researched it but i have seen vocnoise sil um i would personally research 
it if i was president vocnoise sil um documentaries and whatnot sil and things on 
twenty twenty sil vocnoise sil which sil i dont sil cutoffwhowhole whole heartedly believe just 
because its on tv and they say its so sil vocnoise sil but if it 
is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it 
once its on tv sil vocnoise sil um vocnoise that three strikes and youre out 
sil vocnoise has really seemed to work in california sil because most of the people 
sil vocnoise sil that are committing the violent crimes with guns or sil rapes or 
what not vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise are doing sil vocnoise sil most of the 
crime sil vocnoise sil so once theyre locked up sil yeah it costs more money 
to house them for life sil vocnoise sil but theyre saving so much sil because 
crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets 
anymore sil vocnoise sil so they dont have to catch them sil sil sil they 
dont have to process them etcetera vocnoise sil um vocnoise so i would really like 
to see that sil and plus i think once that really sil is sil in 
sil unknownf sil unknownk cutoffworworks the works sil vocnoise sil and really working and were 
really do were gonna say were doing instead of like little parents no honey dont 
do that vocnoise no honey dont do that vocnoise yknow what i mean because i 
think thats sil part of our problem too sil vocnoise iver um iver yeah iver 
exactly vocnoise sil um vocnoise i think that would deter people sil um unknownb you 
get one strike and youre like uh sil oh sil um maybe i better clean 
up my act laughmy iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver umhum iver umhum iver 
umhum iver umhum iver umhum sil sure iver vocnoise no sil no sil but sil 
hopefully vocnoise when they do get the one strike sil somebody vocnoise i say somebody 
because sil i sil right now i dont really think we have that in place 
sil vocnoise but we would need more of a um sil vocnoise one strike sil 
stepping stone sil vocnoise sil yknow and cutoffii sil cutoffthithink sil lets face it counselings 
probably not gonna work sil vocnoise sil uh and somebody in that it would almost 
take um i sil do personally know people vocnoise sil that vocnoise go into that 
type of environment here in columbus and actually work sil with the families sil vocnoise 
sil and sil work with the kids sil and actually are in there sil living 
there sil vocnoise showing them sil vocnoise sil yknow hesits its one thing to go 
help them sil vocnoise and then leave that and go home to your nice house 
sil vocnoise sil i dont sil cutoffunforunfortunately vocnoise i admit it i couldnt do it 
sil vocnoise but sil um sil hesif if people really sil did things like that 
i think thered be help for them sil vocnoise because theyre actually sil friends sil 
vocnoise sil or actually people that have sil been in that environment sil and come 
out vocnoise sil those type of people i think might be able to reach them 
sil i wont be able to reach them sil probably sil just because sil vocnoise 
what do i know about it sil vocnoisewordword sil um sil vocnoise sil im vocnoise 
yeah i agree sil i dont think itd be a deterrent at all sil vocnoise 
sil initially sil but sil if we had more things in place and somebody actually 
sil realized the background sil vocnoise sil and tried to get them out of that 
sil hopefully even if you save half of them its better than sil than anything 
sil iver vocnoise iver umhum iver umhum iver laugh vocnoise yeah vocnoise cutoffi iver right 
vocnoise right iver yeah i mean you dont want to see the chain gangs or 
the people whipping them vocnoise sil i mean lets thats not right either vocnoise um 
sil but vocnoise yeah im not for the weight rooms because like they said they 
come out and then theyre stronger laughand laugh sil they can do more damage laugh 
yeah and youre like extgreat and we paid for that okay vocnoise so sil cutoffii 
sil cutoffyyou sil cutoffii sil i think just to keep them busy yknow even if 
they educate them ive heard of people yknow the education vocnoise um sil cutoffththe sil 
cutoffii strong cutoffii i dont think itd really hurt anybody vocnoise um vocnoise cutoffii and 
cutoffththe sil id say incorporate that with some education sil um vocnoise of some cutoffsosort 
yknow vocnoise mean i dont wanna go out in the sun and work laughforfivehours or 
what not vocnoise plus theyre doing something vocnoise in return for sil free housing sil 
do yknow what i mean sil its kind of a give and take there iver 
yeah vocnoise yeah iver umhum sil umhum iver right sil right vocnoise right iver yeah 
iver well unfortunately i dont think its fair vocnoise but vocnoise i think in the 
long run sil cutoffiit cutoffiit sil cutoffiit it doesnt have to be a college education 
because sil most of those people probably wouldnt want sil a college education sil um 
but like a trade or a skill or something vocnoise itll give them a little 
bit of hope sil if they do wanna choose to get a job instead of 
vocnoise robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did vocnoise they have that 
choice sil its its sil its up in their head okay i can either go 
vocnoise become a welder vocnoise or i can cutofft cutofft have a gun vocnoise um 
i mean if they want a college education sil um vocnoise yeah its vocnoise its 
not fair vocnoise but vocnoise hesuh for unknown for you growing up and going into 
a lifestyle i would prefer vocnoise having their colleges paid for and then being productive 
citizens vocnoise than somebody robbing me someday because they didnt get an education vocnoise i 
mean now thats a sil broad spectrum and i know its not all that cut 
and extdried vocnoise um sil yeah it would upset me sil but hopefully id step 
back from it a little bit and go vocnoise well vocnoise maybe it is for 
the best vocnoise yeah iver yeah i think it is sil course we were fiddling 
with that so much unknown laugh iver excludecounting iver okay vocnoise iver okay vocnoise um 
i grew up in canton sil which is near cleveland vocnoise um sil i moved 
here sil in ninety two to go to sil college vocnoise um sil i spent 
my sil senior year abroad sil in england vocnoise then i came back i have 
a double major vocnoise and sil i had a quarter to finish off sil then 
i came back and did that and then sil went back to england to work 
vocnoise then came back and back to england again and came back and im freelance 
right now sil freelance writer and editor iver vocnoise um sil vocnoise all types i 
sil i used to work in the music industry so i do a lot of 
sil music related writing vocnoise in the position im in right now i do it 
sil just a variety of sil travel writing and that kind of thing hesi sil 
concentrate sil primarily on editing iver vocnoise uh sil extas sil heswell sil actually when 
i was at ohio state i worked for the newspaper iver and sil i did 
a lot of music interviewing and sil writing there and then i moved up to 
editor sil and it was sil sort of through that job that i got my 
first job with sil sony sil while i was sil as a cutoffhaohio sil as 
a sort of ohio representative vocnoise so i was concentrated in ohio state vocnoise and 
then vocnoise yknow sil basically sil its just something im not doing this sil as 
a career its just sort of something im doing in the meantime till i sil 
decide whether im going back to school or iver what im doing iver vocnoise um 
sil a lot of online sil magazines sil music magazines iver that kind of thing 
iver vocnoise uh i would sil either go back in uh sil languages vocnoise or 
sil actually im a psychology laughundergradso laugh vocnoise yeah iver i lived i studied in 
bristol and then when i went back and worked and then lived again i lived 
in london iver hesit it was fantastic iver right iver absolutely vocnoise iver i iver 
i cant imagine that it heswouldve i mean im sure brazil wouldve been heseven vocnoise 
more different experience but i think it was vocnoise more just sil hesa sil a 
resentment for sil sort of everything about america and what sil what theyre fed it 
was a real love hate relationship iver yknow it was sil noise sil while they 
totally embrace the culture and all the stores and everything like that vocnoise and the 
food sil it yknow the fast food or whatever sil they hate it at the 
same time because its ruining sil yknow cutoffanand sil hesand i had a lot of 
friends from elsewhere in yknow western europe vocnoise and uh sil yeah they just were 
cutoffkinkindof sil and hesi sil cutoffii sil i was quite surprised actually because when i 
first went there vocnoise uh id worked on an hesisland sil previous unknown sil i 
mean mackinaw island do you know it sil sort of just sil north of michigan 
but vocnoise and i had met some english people there and it was vocnoise yknow 
there all the americans were like oh english people your accent is so neat and 
vocnoise all that kind of thing and then when i went there sil yknow i 
sil and this was actually one of my friends but i remember vocnoise yknow sil 
she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words 
and things and then vocnoise she sort of looked at me and she said like 
sil oh sil actually i shouldnt be asking you i dont wanna learn the american 
way to say those like i wanna learn the british way to sil and people 
would say things all the time and it was vocnoise yknow theyd ask you what 
your background was vocnoise and if youd say well im american they said well yknow 
like sil where sil your sil ancestors from or whatever vocnoise and then you would 
tell them sil and then sil yknow on the same turn they would just sort 
of like snicker and be like oh youre not sil whatever of this european thing 
youre sil vocnoise sil yknow sort of vocnoise iver yeah yeah like iver definitely vocnoise 
iver and sil and that what they say that weve done to the language and 
everything else and vocnoise and sil youre not a typical american laughbutyknow and then the 
next hour and a half they just say how vocnoise bad americans are and you 
kind of think like vocnoise well thanks for the exclusion but laughyoustillhavebeeninsultingmeforanhourandahalf iver laugh laughyes 
exactly iver right iver or american literature hesor yknow hesanything vocnoise yknow if iver yknow 
a historic building theyre like sil oh vocnoise theres no history in america laughyknow iver 
uhhuh iver right iver right iver well it sil obviously i sort of surmounted that 
because ive been sil yknow i spent a lot of time there since then i 
think had i sil only studied there for a semester hesor a quarter i wouldve 
come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year 
so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then sil yknow after 
that yknow you just sort of vocnoise yeah get to the point where youre just 
kinda cutoffllike vocnoise yknow laugh it off and just think oh here we go again 
and then iver thats it iver yknow iver uh iver no vocnoise the lifestyle was 
sil yknow very easy to fit into and ive always been sil yknow sil interested 
it and sil yknow sil sort of like to the whole like sil european culture 
vocnoise um sil sil before i went there but sil i think sil the most 
difficult was sil actually because i was studying english when i went there vocnoise and 
sil yknow studying hesenglish here is sil a dime a dozen and sil studying english 
in cutoffameramerica sil or in sil england hesis vocnoise yknow sil sort of sil i 
dont know uh more uh sort of elitist which i didnt realize before i got 
there vocnoise so i was in all these courses i was the only american and 
the classes were really small vocnoise and it was sil yknow you sil i definitely 
got a feeling and a sil it sil there were a few classes that really 
stood out where cutoffthathere sil vocnoise yknow there was sort of vocnoise yknow youd sil 
id hafta say something or id hafta give a presentation or something and it was 
sort of like oh sil yknow what what does this american know and vocnoise yknow 
it was that was the hardest thing is sil the way i was treated by 
some of my um peers in classes sil i mean not directly theyd never say 
anything sil terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of sil yknow 
that feeling of sil uh iver and what they would say about americans and american 
culture like sil at sil that discussion group yknow in front of you yknow so 
iver laugh iver i love columbus actually vocnoise um sil when i left sil i 
was sil fed up with columbus sil and sil vocnoise but sil like anything yknow 
after being away for a while and sil not really vocnoise yknow being i mean 
i have sil friends there and everything but sil yknow i missed my friends and 
i missed sil unknown sil really sort of vocnoise yknow sil knowing everything in the 
city because london vocnoise sil is never gonna be like that for me yknow and 
its just a totally different experience and vocnoise yknow i did miss columbus and im 
kinda glad to be back sil although now i miss london laughso laugh iver um 
sil well maybe not columbus in particular sil but sil vocnoise i dont know i 
was sil i think i was just a little burnt out because i was doing 
the two majors and i was sil i had a heavy course load sil every 
quarter and i had gone to summer school here as well just to get more 
done and so id vocnoise yknow done seven straight quarters and sil im sure that 
added to it i had a lot of hard classes and vocnoise yknow vocnoise i 
was just tired of laughohiostateandtiredofbeinghereandyknow sil red tape and iver that whole thing iver vocnoise 
in english sil umhum iver uh sil well i think hesonly because i went abroad 
i had sil basically one extra quarter beyond four years iver but hesas i said 
i went to summer school too and iver i was taking like sil yknow sil 
twenty one laughtotwentythreehours a quarter so sil laugh iver yes sil umhum vocnoise yeah i 
do miss that sil but at the same time ive vocnoise yknow i had a 
lot of opportunity sil to be there and to do those things so vocnoise sil 
and i mean there vocnoise there are vocnoise yknow sil its obviously you cant compare 
it but sil yknow there are cultural things to do in columbus and it does 
sort of make me mad when vocnoise yknow people are kinda like oh columbus yknow 
theres nothing to do there i find myself defending columbus a lot more now than 
iver i ever sil wouldve before iver iver uh huh iver vocnoise laugh iver yes 
iver right sil right iver absolutely vocnoise iver oh yes iver id come back and 
its vocnoise laugh iver the simplest things iver noiseum iver umhum iver umhum iver vocnoise 
um sil actually sil vocnoise sil i was over there when all of that happened 
but of course it was sil vocnoise all over the papers and vocnoise yknow sil 
i think sil i mean i extid i dont know what it was like really 
here i can imagine but vocnoise i mean there especially they really focused on sil 
um sil not columbine but sil the one with the sil the younger kids in 
arkansas vocnoise was it sil the year before i was there for sil both of 
those but vocnoise yknow vocnoise in the first one yknow they they put the picture 
of the little kid in combat gear cutoffhoholding holding the gun sil everywhere and vocnoise 
columbine vocnoise sil vocnoise yknow sil vocnoise every paper had a slightly different slant on 
the story and vocnoise yknow their facts were all over the place but thats another 
vocnoise kind of issue but vocnoise um sil what i think caused it i mean 
sil i dont know i think that sil like sil more shouldve been made of 
the fact of vocnoise yknow this sil like sil terrible vocnoise sort of sil resentment 
for the other students and sil and vocnoise yknow im not in any way defending 
sil the guys who did it but vocnoise um sil yknow vocnoise something sil is 
wrong sil not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven 
to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever vocnoise that 
sil yknow that you would even sil think of doing something like that sil um 
sil i dont know especially with vocnoise yknow everything that was said about the families 
and sil yknow they didnt seem to vocnoise of course you never really know but 
they didnt seem to have grown up in this yknow terrible environment and vocnoise yknow 
have that sort of vocnoise yknow sil preconditioned or anything like that vocnoise um sil 
yeah i think cutoffiit sil a lot more effort sil needs to be made vocnoise 
yknow to sort of vocnoise yknow placate those sort of situations and vocnoise i mean 
sil who does it is sort of another question because vocnoise yknow the teachers already 
sil are over worked and underpaid and sil yknow vocnoise all those kind of things 
but vocnoise i dont know iver right iver right sil right iver well i do 
think access is too easy but its sort of vocnoise like anything else i think 
if laws were passed sil the people who were sil against it would be so 
sil yknow sil just beside themselves that it would vocnoise i dont know for how 
long but i think it would make sil the situation sil not with cutoffththe sil 
the shootings and things like that but i think it would make sil the sil 
just the gun situation probably cutoffm sil much worse for a while because people would 
be vocnoise yknow sil doing sil illegal things to get guns and that sort of 
thing vocnoise but sil i mean too many people have guns here sil theres too 
much of a vocnoise in my opinion yknow theres too much of a gun culture 
vocnoise i mean over there sil theyve sil pretty much sil vocnoise outlawed guns except 
for hunting and things and the fact that cutoffyyou sil yknow of course there are 
some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that sil 
obviously englands such a small country in comparison but vocnoise i mean thats just amazing 
to me sil and vocnoise but its true i mean the fact that sil vocnoise 
yknow the access is just vocnoise theres vocnoise sil almost nothing barred and i mean 
sil just the amount of people that i just hear sort of vocnoise yknow in 
conversation talking about oh yeah i sil yknow vocnoise getting a gun for security and 
all this stuff its like sil yknow sil extwhat your chances of vocnoise number one 
needing it sil and vocnoise number two sil if you were in that just minute 
vocnoise percentage of sil yknow sil happen chance that you would need it the fact 
that vocnoise if you used it to shoot someone who wasnt yknow i extmean sil 
vocnoise everything is against you vocnoise iver yknow vocnoise iver yeah exactly and its just 
vocnoise its just ridiculous but so many people dont seem to think that way and 
vocnoise i do think vocnoise yeah access sil it would help if access sil were 
restricted vocnoise sil or vocnoise at least if they were more sil careful about it 
i mean it seems like even vocnoise the laws that there are in place now 
arent necessarily followed and sil yknow that kind of thing iver but the whole vocnoise 
it sil especially with the first vocnoise few shootings yknow with the childrens vocnoise i 
mean iver yknow they shouldnt know where the keys are if there were keys to 
the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that vocnoise a yknow how do 
you explain your way out of sil your kids taking guns to school iver right 
iver oh were they were already in the garage did they not buy them themselves 
iver oh right iver oh right iver right iver right vocnoise right sil well its 
sort of a problem as well the sil yknow sil does sil vocnoise sil i 
mean uh its seems vocnoise yknow from what ive read it sil if you wanted 
to make a bomb its fairly cutoffununcomplicated sil uncomplicated sil yknow so vocnoise thats iver 
right vocnoise um sil at the age that they were iver i dont know sil 
i sil i wouldnt sil personally like think that the parents should be held responsible 
vocnoise i mean they do have vocnoise yknow a certain amount of responsibility for the 
fact that they shouldve been more aware and sil and especially because vocnoise i mean 
i believe that those vocnoise or at least one of the two had been in 
vocnoise counseling and vocnoise had to sil yknow was doing it sil vocnoise aggression management 
or something like that vocnoise um sil yknow you would think sil that sil if 
they were going through something like that vocnoise you would just sort of sil yknow 
maybe keep a closer eye on sil what they were doing so i think vocnoise 
yknow sil to that degree sil yknow the parents shouldve sil um vocnoise yknow sil 
um sil worse vocnoise sort of responsible sil and also vocnoise with like their kids 
disposition i mean vocnoise yknow sil would you not notice some difference if something like 
that was going to happen i mean depending on sil a sil yknow how well 
they hid it or whatever but vocnoise um vocnoise i think at that point though 
youre sil youre so influenced by your peers iver that like hesuh sil the parental 
influence isnt as much as sil yknow before then i think by the time that 
you are past adolescence iver umhum iver right iver i know iver um sil well 
like i said before i think sil i dont know i think screening would be 
very difficult sil i mean vocnoise especially sil because at that age youre gonna have 
a lot of people who are sil yknow people say things to say things and 
to get a reaction and vocnoise to tell their friends that sil they said i 
mean vocnoise yknow sil they can play off sil whatever and unless they were vocnoise 
yknow sil highly sil skilled or trained in that area i mean sil you cant 
really do a simple sort of screening and sil these are good and these are 
bad uh and vocnoise again as i mentioned previously sil i think its more to 
do with vocnoise maybe being aware of the interaction sil of sil yknow the different 
students with each other and vocnoise i mean if it was as bad as sil 
they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and vocnoise i mean 
youre youre never going to get rid of all of that because there are always 
different groups and different cliques but sil i cant help but thinking that if it 
was bad enough that you would sil do something like that vocnoise that sil yknow 
sil had to have been more than just sil yknow sort of sil normal sil 
jocks versus sil whatever sil so i think it should be more vocnoise i dont 
know sil i mean even sil yknow i went to a sil private sil catholic 
highschools sil but vocnoise even there yknow there was sil yknow uh sil a sense 
of that and i mean some of the things that went on vocnoise should definitely 
not have been going on and that was vocnoise sil only on a very small 
level there were eighty six people in my graduating class yknow and i mean sil 
this is a highschool with like several hundred students that this happened at so iver 
umhum iver umhum vocnoise i think in fifth grade sil was the first iver um 
sil i mean at that point sil i uh sil i certainly didnt have sil 
any uh sil real vocnoise knowledge laughaboutany of that sort of thing vocnoise um vocnoise 
yknow they covered vocnoise the basics sil extum sil they did talk about condoms and 
vocnoise um contraception vocnoise i remember we vocnoise watched a film sil which everyone was 
very embarrassed by sil um vocnoise i mean i dont really vocnoise sil uh they 
uh they did send home a packet to the parents vocnoise because i remember being 
really upset and not wanting my mom laughtotalkwithmeaboutit iver vocnoise um sil but vocnoise yknow 
i think what they did was sil fairly good they didnt really vocnoise as far 
as i remember at that point at least they didnt sil well they must have 
done gone into the sort of moral issue vocnoise um sil but it i sil 
what i remember was more of a scientific approach iver umhum iver right iver all 
i remember is sil them talking about condoms i dont think they talked about sil 
anything besides that vocnoise but vocnoise um sil then again vocnoise i could laughberememberingwrong vocnoise 
um but yes that hesi mean vocnoise it is the stance but i think vocnoise 
in the schools sil i mean thats sort of like the the hard line of 
the catholic church but in the more progressive schools theyre a little bit more realistic 
sil i mean this wasnt sil i mean it was a catholic school but we 
didnt have nuns or anything there i mean vocnoise um vocnoise yknow i think sil 
they were sort of sil more concerned with sil yknow sil it it actually it 
might have been later than the first vocnoise um vocnoise sex education we had that 
young i mean it might have been more like a errorcoupahcouple vocnoise like eight grade 
that they talked about condoms sil i doubt that they wouldve done that that early 
now that i think about it vocnoise but i know that there was at one 
point vocnoise yknow vocnoise some sort of iver umhum iver um sil vocnoise sil not 
really vocnoise sil because i think sil yknow sil extif sil if theyre going to 
sil theyre going to and sil i dont think sil a lot of them at 
sil that stage are gonna go out of their way to go vocnoise sil and 
buy them so i dont think its like sil oh i have a condom im 
going to have sex vocnoise sil i mean actually its sil this vocnoise is is 
very hot topic in england right now because they theyve got sil the highest rate 
sil of teenage pregnancy in the world vocnoise and i mean there are stories everywhere 
about sil yknow twelve year olds having babies and vocnoise i mean there theyve gone 
to distributing sil condoms on playgrounds which i do think is sil a little bit 
vocnoise too much i think maybe having them available in the nurses office is one 
thing vocnoise theyre there vocnoise yknow sil they can go and sil and sil get 
some or something but i think actually like physically vocnoise yknow passing them out is 
a bad idea vocnoise sil but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think is 
pretty important just vocnoise sil yknow uh sil because of the simple fact of the 
statistics that theyre they are doing it so sil at least sil at the very 
least they might as well be vocnoise yknow safe about it iver um sil well 
actually sil its sil sort of all happening in a certain area vocnoise sil yknow 
with sil yknow very high unemployment like council vocnoise council states vocnoise um sil yknow 
sil the sort of stereotype yknow kind of bad family environment sil yknow sil parents 
have lots of sil boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and vocnoise yknow a lot 
of these vocnoise girls that have been interviewed sil yknow say oh yknow i wanted 
something to love or vocnoise yknow vocnoise we were bored so we decided to have 
sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling sil and sil yknow a 
thirteen year old boy who was interviewed was saying vocnoise oh yknow he had sil 
yknow vocnoise slept with like sil ten girls or something and sil im thinking sil 
oh my gosh yknow and hes thirteen and vocnoise yknow had a few kids and 
vocnoise that was it but vocnoise in my opinion the main problem there is vocnoise 
they get more support sil even at that age sil when they have sil they 
sil yknow they get unemployment because once theyve had a kid even if theyre not 
vocnoise of working age they get like a sil an a certain amount of money 
and then once they reach i think cutoffffifteen sil um fifteen or sixteen vocnoise if 
they have a baby theyre provided theyre cutofflilike sil the top of the list for 
a council house vocnoise so they get their own there was actually a sil long 
documentary on before i left vocnoise um vocnoise yknow of this girl who was constantly 
fighting with her parents vocnoise and vocnoise yknow her parents were at the end of 
their rope vocnoise she got pregnant and she was like well vocnoise yknow hey sil 
this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets 
sil money for herself money for the baby she doesnt have to pay any utilities 
or anything vocnoise and sil yknow sil what more vocnoise could she want sil yknow 
was basically what she was saying sil ive got my own place i can do 
whatever i want im getting money and i dont have to work vocnoise and sil 
and so sil vocnoise that i think is a very bad situation because theyre almost 
rewarded for sil yknow iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver um sil youll sil 
i i just got back from sil a year in england so cutoffyyeah im not 
sure about the new iver right iver stay on it iver right iver umhum iver 
umhum iver umhum iver well is there any kind of vocnoise yknow training i mean 
do you sil are they doing like the whole vocnoise job training after the two 
years or during the two years iver right iver right iver right iver i think 
thats great sil yknow i think sil obviously vocnoise theres always sil a down side 
and sil but sil i think that sil too many people abuse the system vocnoise 
and vocnoise yknow sil unfortunately sil its sil very hard when sil yknow sil then 
it ruins it for the people who really do need it sil and but vocnoise 
yknow as long as they have vocnoise yknow created sil a system sil whereby sil 
yknow it wont be vocnoise obviously as good for those people vocnoise as it has 
been the ones who are genuinely unemployable but vocnoise yknow sil i think sil depending 
on how sil um vocnoise sort of focused they are on vocnoise the individuals in 
their area or whatever however its divided up vocnoise i dont know hopefully sil not 
special treatment but obviously you would try to steer them more in sil whichever direction 
theyre most suited for vocnoise yknow as errorfallfar vocnoise far as maybe like the volunteer 
work because i mean vocnoise yknow there is so much volunteering to be done sil 
everywhere and even if you dont have vocnoise yknow sil if youre lacking in vocnoise 
whatever way vocnoise sil extyoud think that you can sil yknow there is something vocnoise 
yknow hopefully that vocnoise sil i dont know iver umhum vocnoise umhum iver actually theyre 
they are working on it im sorry i didnt mean to interrupt you uh vocnoise 
um sil theyve vocnoise sil theyve um just instated some bonus schemes where vocnoise as 
sil the poverty cutoffletelevel sil level i think is considered um sil thirteen sil thousand 
pounds a year vocnoise um sil and if vocnoise if youre below the poverty level 
and you do go back to work you get a certain like sil extra sil 
bonus vocnoise beyond vocnoise yeah so theres a bonus for back to work vocnoise you 
mentioned earlier about like how this would effect the children with this two year welfare 
thing vocnoise i mean at least vocnoise i know a lot more about sil the 
system there for sil laughforwhatever reason than i do about the system here which is 
kind of unfortunate but vocnoise um vocnoise there i mean sil i dont really think 
sil and a lot of situations vocnoise of course sil i im sure there are 
people who follow it vocnoise as it should be and who sil who really need 
it and who really vocnoise yknow taking care of their children but unfortunately you dont 
really see that side very much you see the people who like vocnoise their kids 
see none of that money sil yknow theyre left at home by themselves sil if 
vocnoise if they can even vocnoise yknow get them to school if they even go 
to school if theyre even bothered yknow sil and vocnoise sil yknow those sil yknow 
a lot of theres there cutoffdocdocumentaries documentaries on all the time there so you really 
sil its sort of cutoffs sil its more in your face than it is here 
at sil that i ever noticed um vocnoise but i do think sil and and 
sil with that they have specific programs for the children and vocnoise um vocnoise i 
think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that yknow vocnoise 
if a sil if a kid has bad behavior or vocnoise yknow bad attendance that 
you send them home i mean i think thats the most ridiculous thing like surely 
thats sil not a punishment for a lot of these kids vocnoise and vocnoise yknow 
sil at least in england vocnoise on these things ive seen yknow they send them 
home and these kids are just sil doing whatever vocnoise going around the neighborhood shoplifting 
bullying sil yknow hotwiring cars at the age of yknow ten or something and vocnoise 
i dont know i think sil i do have laughsortofverystrongopinions about sil people vocnoise yeah 
who vocnoise are having all these kids and dont take care of them sil at 
all iver um sil yes i vocnoise havent they talked about that here actually vocnoise 
have they talked about iver right iver vocnoise right with the human rights iver right 
vocnoise um sil personally i think its a good idea i mean uh sil i 
vocnoise i mean sil to me sil yknow sil it seems only logical that you 
would only have the amount of children that you can support vocnoise yknow and that 
sil but sil vocnoise i come from a completely different yknow background and everything else 
and sil the education and a lot cutoffm yknow sil then most of vocnoise probably 
the people that this would vocnoise um concern vocnoise but i do think vocnoise i 
sil i dont know vocnoise i mean vocnoise with uh the cutoffbbirth sil birth control 
that is available vocnoise and vocnoise yknow vocnoise all the options that there are vocnoise 
sil sometimes sil i find it sil hard to be sympathetic for vocnoise yknow these 
people who just have so many children that they cant feed they cutoffttake cant take 
care of vocnoise sil i mean vocnoise its not like sil it was sil way 
back when when there was nothing and cutoffyyou sil you were just stuck this way 
i mean a noisewoman can vocnoise yknow sil protect herself sil if vocnoise yknow the 
cutoffmman sil the man isnt willing to do it or whatever vocnoise so and and 
vocnoise and vocnoise adoption and all the other things iver um vocnoise i mean i 
feel vocnoise i lean toward no vocnoise i dont have a problem actually i saw 
something on the news the other night about they were offering vocnoise um sil crack 
mothers vocnoise like sil money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that 
vocnoise um sil but again like the argument sil there on the human rights side 
was that if theyre vocnoise yknow sil on cocaine or whatever they cant sil make 
sil the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like vocnoise can 
they make the sound decision to have children iver right vocnoise right iver right iver 
umhum iver right iver noise sil um well vocnoise as far as the racism issue 
first vocnoise uh they showed some figures on the news and actually vocnoise it was 
sil like vocnoise more vocnoise white women sil who had actually sil had it sil 
done sil than sil uh sil vocnoise sil than vocnoise um hispanic or african american 
vocnoise but sil i dont know sil at least vocnoise in that case sil i 
mean before we were talking about the government sil i mean at least in that 
case there still is a choice vocnoise i mean vocnoise theres money involved but its 
sil its not sil so much money that sil it would vocnoise radically change your 
life sil in a sort of vocnoise yknow its not thousands of dollars if it 
was two hundred i believe vocnoise and sil and sil thats sil yknow i mean 
if sil if that vocnoise amount of sil money sil is sil going to sway 
you vocnoise in that direction vocnoise i dont know sil i think vocnoise yknow there 
is the debate about ten years down the line but cutoffwhawhat sil yknow is there 
going to be something thats going to make them change vocnoise yknow what is it 
yknow vocnoise what is it going to be and like how vocnoise how realistic vocnoise 
is it for yknow what percentage i mean i dont know anything about the sort 
of statistics of vocnoise people who do clean up their act or anything like that 
but sil i mean i do think if there is that element of choice sil 
its a lot different than vocnoise yknow the government vocnoise saying okay this is your 
cut off limit but i mean the statistics they were cutoffgigiving giving on sil um 
the average number of children that these women were having and vocnoise yknow vocnoise yknow 
the sil average sil number of children that were just vocnoise taken to the hospital 
and left there or vocnoise yknow just dropped off wherever and and the state these 
children were in and vocnoise their lifespan and everything else i mean vocnoise yknow theres 
the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the vocnoise 
the childs life yknow i mean i think vocnoise all that is forgotten about in 
so many of these cases and vocnoise yknow the same vocnoise is in england yeah 
everyone saying vocnoise oh because they were talking about vocnoise yknow vocnoise i mean again 
was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of vocnoise yknow vocnoise somehow 
vocnoise sort of noise forcing these young girls to at least be on birth control 
vocnoise yknow vocnoise in whatever way and vocnoise and vocnoise again that vocnoise everyone was 
up in arms but its vocnoise sort of like vocnoise yknow vocnoise what is that 
childs quality of life gonna be when their mothers sil just sil yknow iver right 
vocnoise right iver umhum iver oh yes definitely in england too iver umhum iver hm 
iver umhum iver right iver um i dont vocnoise i mean there definitely is that 
image of sil yknow dallas and dynasty i think its vocnoise its worse sil i 
think sil for sil the vocnoise the vocnoise image of the tourist like basically they 
think vocnoise anyone who can vocnoise afford to be over there sil must be absolutely 
loaded vocnoise yknow and that was sort of another thing vocnoise when vocnoise yknow i 
went to vocnoise school there vocnoise is vocnoise yknow vocnoise i had a scholarship vocnoise 
thats how i went there vocnoise yknow and vocnoise i worked the whole time i 
was in highschool in college and all this kind of thing but it was just 
like vocnoise yeah people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore vocnoise 
you must have lots of extra money to throw around vocnoise and vocnoise yknow they 
just cutoffjhjust sort of dont grasp the fact that vocnoise yknow vocnoise you can have 
made sacrifices to be there vocnoise but vocnoise i do think vocnoise also in films 
yknow i remember actually being in bristol and that film california vocnoise with brad pitt 
and juliette lewis and yknow theyre in vocnoise the trailer and everything else and vocnoise 
yknow vocnoise their accent and vocnoise and sil i remember vocnoise a bunch of people 
were sitting in this sort of lounge room watching this and they said like vocnoise 
oh vocnoise yknow something like is that what they talk like or is that what 
its like in the south and i thought laughohmygosh yknow vocnoise what an image to 
have of like vocnoise the south and vocnoise yknow i was just kind of shocked 
vocnoise at this sil but vocnoise i think that there vocnoise yknow sil with vocnoise 
yknow people who are going to university there and things like that vocnoise there isnt 
necessarily that opinion maybe vocnoise yknow vocnoise in a certain sector like when all youve 
heard is sil the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea 
but i think vocnoise yknow sil most people sil like me or whatever sil they 
sil well sil i shouldnt say like vocnoise but sil yknow people who have more 
education sort of vocnoise not even without having to really think about it but vocnoise 
yknow there isnt just that sil blatant view i mean i think that it is 
vocnoise um sil the consumption thing sil like sil i think a lot sil more 
realize now vocnoise that sil yknow vocnoise i think americans have this sil just sil 
reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending vocnoise and sil like sil 
obviously when you give that a closer look sil so many people are in debt 
i mean i think i just saw something else on the news that said vocnoise 
yknow vocnoise across the board vocnoise we dont even break even were like vocnoise negative 
one or something iver right right iver right iver credit cards iver right iver exactly 
exactly iver absolutely iver oh yeah iver i know iver vocnoise and thats actually a 
really interesting thing too because vocnoise especially coming back vocnoise yknow and vocnoise moving all 
my stuff out of storage vocnoise ive just been on this yknow im getting rid 
of half of everything i own because over there its vocnoise yknow sil it just 
feels so weird to come back and i feel so vocnoise loaded down especially when 
ive spent so much time just living out of a suitcase yknow i just really 
realize vocnoise i have so much stuff that i dont need because there yknow everyone 
has just sort of like vocnoise a little closet with clothes yknow there isnt stuff 
all around everything is more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here its 
like vocnoise everything is so vocnoise relatively inexpensive that its like vocnoise yknow picture frames 
or something there might be yknow twenty five dollars for one so you buy one 
here sil oh vocnoise yknow theyre five dollars a piece lets buy five yknow iver 
yeah vocnoise exactly iver um sil well i think vocnoise the price has a lot 
to do with it vocnoise because sil i mean thats what i see sil see 
over there that prevents it vocnoise yknow vocnoise there a sort of middle of the 
line vocnoise dress that would be like at the limited here or something is sil 
yknow sil seventy five pounds sil yknow at sil like a dollar sixty five or 
whatever conversion i mean thats a lot sil yknow you see them in the limited 
and you think whatever the price is expensive but vocnoise yknow sil really if you 
buy that sil youre not really gonna be vocnoise buying sil vocnoise yknow more than 
one or like anything else for awhile and vocnoise i think sil i mean here 
there is that sort of like yknow vocnoise he who has the most wins or 
whatever that vocnoise yknow phrase is and vocnoise yknow there is that with vocnoise c 
ds and vocnoise whatever sil but vocnoise i dont know sil i mean sil even 
with the food and everything else sil i mean vocnoise its cheap people buy so 
much of it like portions sil are so big because the restaurants can get it 
more cheaply i mean there sil yknow the portions are a lot smaller its more 
expensive you just eat less and i mean sil you just see it contributing to 
everything i mean sil it the obesity problem here and everything else i mean sil 
its getting worse there than it was but i mean its sil nowhere is it 
any where near and that is sil a large part of the like vocnoise problem 
with that sil people were constantly on me about oh why are americans so fat 
and like sil all these things on the television about the americans and i mean 
that was never ending iver laughohmygosh iver right sil right iver that is surprising iver 
oh yeah iver oh yeah iver yeah i mean its just sort of like the 
whole reputation of vocnoise yeah cutoffmamerica vocnoise america just being like the country of excess 
like excess possessions excess food excess weight excess money vocnoise yknow vocnoise sil vocnoise everything 
sil yknow and its sil hesits vocnoise yknow i sort of have mixed feelings about 
it the first time when i was gone for vocnoise about a year and a 
half vocnoise and i noisecame back vocnoise and sil vocnoise yknow this i had done 
like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere 
especially of mainland europe and everything and i come back and vocnoise yknow where my 
parents live there were all these yknow new strip malls built and stuff vocnoise and 
i just felt like i was in sil yknow vocnoise this like giant noisekmart laughlandyouknowimean 
it just was so overwhelming vocnoise even though obviously id grown up sil with vocnoise 
in america my whole life and vocnoise yknow not that i sort of sil vocnoisechanged 
completely but you do when youve been away from it and to come back and 
yknow to go into these like vocnoisecavernous places and like just the other day my 
friend took me to sil easton and i mean vocnoise you walk in there and 
i dont feel like im in columbus yknow i feel like vocnoise its got to 
be california or something just because its just vocnoise noise iver extyeah definitely iver wow 
iver right iver was she wheres she from latin america iver oh okay iver umhum 
iver extright iver umhum iver right iver oh right iver laugh iver umhum iver oh 
i bet iver right iver extright iver and just totally bombarded and i mean here 
its so force fed as well i mean i vocnoise i hescame sil home just 
before halloween vocnoise and vocnoise yknow i cutoffw vocnoise i walked into the grocery store 
and i mean just like sil right there were just like noise vocnoisecakes vocnoisecupcakes cookies 
like sil everything just right in front of you vocnoise with like all this halloween 
stuff on and i mean vocnoise all the holidays in here are hesso pushed at 
you and noiseits such a money making sil yknow and its so over the top 
where there its sort of like vocnoise theres a little bit of that and there 
are decorations and stuff at christmas but it isnt so much vocnoise yknow and vocnoise 
and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put 
around i mean there sil there isnt that vocnoise at all sil i mean at 
least extin sil yknow sil my noiseexperience there and i mean i cant imagine vocnoise 
because yknow western europe i think hesis sil sort of as much like vocnoise america 
as you can get vocnoise probably sil yknow sil most vocnoise places elsewhere in vocnoise 
in the world sil and i mean vocnoise sil that would have been a fantastic 
experience iver right iver right right iver wow iver umhum iver absolutely iver umhum iver 
umhum iver well vocnoise theres the whole theory that vocnoise yknow sil vocnoise it has 
to drop back at some point vocnoise but vocnoise i dont see it happening sil 
vocnoise sil any vocnoise time in the near future iver and vocnoise errorydowyknow uh vocnoise 
sil as with a lot of the resentment thats felt sil that i experienced toward 
americans vocnoise sil rather saddeningly i think sil our culture is starting vocnoise to really 
vocnoise infuse itself into sil europe at least vocnoise i mean i see instead of 
vocnoise us becoming more like them yknow noisethem becoming more like us walmart has bought 
yknow sil a hesbig sil uh retailer there so vocnoise iver yeah vocnoise and and 
its just its moving there the whole sil yknow strip malls and i was in 
sil i spent my first noisechristmas there in belgium with a friend and i mean 
vocnoise we would drive by and shed be like oh vocnoise this is because of 
yknow your country these people are moving in and buying noisewhatever and sil so vocnoise 
noiseconversely i see it moving in the other direction unfortunately rather than iver really iver 
wow iver laughohreally laugh iver yeah iver is there cutoffs sil the resentment to things 
like mcdonalds there exttoo hesor is it iver right iver oh right iver right iver 
right iver right right iver because that is sort of what i found interesting there 
too i mean there were a lot of jibes sil about that i remember vocnoise 
um vocnoise driving vocnoise to germany vocnoise with a couple a english friends and sil 
to visit some german friends of theirs and sil we got there and it sil 
we cutoffwewere got lost and all these things that took us way longer than it 
shouldve and vocnoise a friend of the person we were visiting said like vocnoise oh 
what did you have to stop at every mcdonalds along the way and i was 
like vocnoise cutoffai vocnoise i vocnoise im a laughvegetarian i dont even eat at mcdonalds 
yknow and vocnoise i was hesjust sil yknow and it was really mean its like 
noisethat isnt really a very good joke vocnoise and that kind of thing came up 
vocnoise quite frequently but vocnoise yknow i always said sil mcdonalds wouldnt survive here if 
no one ate there and you cant tell me that everyone in there vocnoise is 
american iver and they never were i mean the same with vocnoise like in france 
especially oh mcdonalds vocnoise well mcdonalds was full of all the french people yknow i 
mean iver right iver noise iver iver excludeokaytestonetwothreefourfivefivefourthreetwoone iver test one two three four five 
five four three two one iver okay iver umhum iver okay iver okay uh ive 
been in columbus since nineteen seventy seven sil and uh im an air traffic controller 
sil and i have three more days to work before i retire im cutoffretiretiring i 
i cutoffhahave im retiring sunday sil so and tomorrows my vocnoiseretirement dinner sil so uh 
sil a little nervous about what i have to do there yknow noise theyve told 
me nothing except show up iver sil uh i have a daughter at sil o 
u i know thats sil a bad word for you guys iver and i have 
one at northland highschool shes a sophomore there and the one at o us a 
freshman sil and uh im married sil and uh what else i live in uh 
northeast columbus sil by seventy one and one sixty one sil and sil thats about 
it iver sil uh im originally from sil indiana sil but i lived up in 
uh amherst ohio i lived there for about four years and then i because i 
worked at a place called cleveland center sil which is an air route traffic control 
center and i moved from there to sil ohio state sil airport sil and i 
worked there for nineteen years sil and uh then i transferred to sil port columbus 
sil iver about two cutoffyeyears vocnoise two and a half years ago iver right umhum 
excludename umhum iver oh okay iver oh yeah iver yeah iver oh wow oh vocnoise 
so you have it on the speed dial laugh iver vocnoise iver yeah iver umhum 
iver yeah iver right iver vocnoise yeah iver umhum iver oh vocnoise iver i dont 
know what kind that is because i know they cutoffggot they vocnoise traded airplanes since 
ive been gone iver iver yeah iver oh because uh cutoffssome some of the newer 
cutoffwones jets theres like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner i mean its sil 
there are prop planes that are like five times as noisy iver iver sil so 
iver oh iver um iver oh they do now vocnoise iver because they wouldnt let 
them when cutoffwwe i was there iver oh okay vocnoise iver oh iver vocnoise iver 
yeah vocnoise iver uh they uh vocnoise stopped vocnoise sil federally funding uh o s 
u that was a federal control tower sil and they contracted it out so you 
either sil lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you 
picked up and moved on and yknow some people moved like to arizona and california 
and sil and i thought well since i only have like two and a half 
years sil til i retire sil and i really like columbus vocnoise and i thought 
i dont want to cutoffrooroot sil uproot my daughters out of school and cutofflleave sil 
and leave and start over so i thought well ill just go to port columbus 
and sil suffer it out until i can iver retire yeah vocnoise iver well i 
dont really like the uh i dont cutofflilike cutofflilike cutoffllike i really dont like that 
job vocnoise but uh yknow i like the people there but its like uh way 
too busy i think iver iver iver oh it can be yeah iver yeah there 
are there are times when it all just sil theres a uh group over there 
called star check iver and they fly checks sil like sil if you write a 
check today and you deposit at the bank sil well that check has to go 
from your bank sil to clearinghouse sil and thats all they do all night long 
iver right tuesday wednesday and thursday sil every night iver so like thirty of them 
will sil go out at one time and thirty will come back well that isnt 
too bad sil but theyre mixed in with sil everybody else thats normally flying like 
all the airliners and stuff so and they want to get there a s a 
p so sil yknow sil i sil i just dont sil feel comfortable doing sil 
that much at one time i mean not that sil o s u is not 
a was not a a dead place yknow it was very busy its like the 
third busiest in ohio sil but uh yeah its amazing and theyre only open sixteen 
hours a day iver so yknow sil um sil it its pretty sil pretty busy 
there but sil it sil its cutoffspspread spread out over the sixteen hours is where 
as port columbus sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eighty airplanes sil in an 
hours time sil so iver uh well we have an sil upstairs and downstairs upstairs 
is the tower and theres like a uh ground control sil vocnoise a clearance errorlevrylevelreads 
which reads all the clearances all the airplanes and the ground control taxis them to 
and from the runway and the tower works sil everybody sil landing and departing sil 
or any airplane within five mile radius sil then once they get out of that 
sil radius downstairs which is called the approach control they work sil everything from there 
sil to ten thousand feet sil and out to about sixty miles sil and when 
they get to that point then they go to the en route centers iver so 
sil yknow vocnoise downstairs theres five different sectors so they split the uh sil area 
up into five different areas sil and uh yknow there are some sil sectors down 
there that get sil extremely busy and then sometimes its just like yknow youre just 
twiddling your thumbs its sil uh its like feast or famine sil yknow its not 
like steady like if youre sil working at meijer running the cash register its just 
kind of like steady its like you look at sil yknow you cutoffssitting unknown cutoffsso 
youd be like sitting at meijer and theres vocnoise no one in your line sil 
and then you turn your back and turn back around and theres like seventy five 
iver waiting sil and they all want to go right now sil yknow and thats 
how most airplanes are yknow they all they dont think about anybody else they think 
sil im here why um sil why arent i first sil yknow so sil iver 
iver iver right iver uh well the problem is is um sil like say sil 
every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their business 
men there at eight a m sil well sil an airport has sil so many 
runways sil and so many taxi ways sil and yknow like say sil ten airplanes 
sil every ten minutes can come in and out sil of those airports sil well 
vocnoise they sil end up shooting like thirty there sil so sil instead of letting 
them all get in the air sil and staying up there and hold while theyre 
errorfoouhfifiringshooting uh yknow shooting them in what they do is they uh sil like uh 
say going to ohare theyll sil you hafta call for release times at these different 
airports sil and they will say well uh sil he cant go right now but 
he can go like at sil twenty seven past the hour sil so he they 
know by looking at the entire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that 
airport sil when he will fit in sil so its not so much sil air 
traffic delays its sil airlines that cause it themself its like uh yknow like sil 
you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room sil at 
ten oclock today sil well rather than say sil why dont some of you come 
at ten sil and another group come at ten fifteen another group sil unknown and 
were sil all trying to do the same thing at once and it doesnt work 
yknow you sil you cant get unknown you can only get so many people through 
that door sil and if you say well im gonna take five at a time 
sil well they can get in but if you say im taking five hundred at 
time sil it doesnt work and sil so the cutoffairplaairplane sil airlines always go well 
its the government sil and regulations and blah blah blah thats sil why were delayed 
and its really them themselves vocnoise because theyre iver iver right sil yknow because every 
businessman goes i want to be there at yknow sil and it doesnt work that 
way yknow you cant sil you just cant physically do it iver i sil that 
i dont know sil but uh yknow its like if sil if you and i 
are running an airline sil and everybody wants to get new york at eight a 
m and you go at eight sil and i go at eight thirty sil who 
are they gonna fly iver iver sil so that i think thats a problem too 
yknow everybody says well i dont want to get there at eight thirty sil yknow 
so iver yeah sil the one thing theyve done is theyve sil put on bigger 
airplanes sil because it used to be yknow you sil like a uh sil say 
uh sil seven thirty seven would go from here to new york city and now 
its a seven fifty seven so that adds more seats sil so instead of sil 
because i cutoffwowould when i first got there i couldnt understand sil at o s 
u sil when it was like sil christmas time or something it was just sil 
youd drive up and the parking lot was just full of cars and youre like 
oh boy laugh iver gonna be a really busy day sil and i would sil 
the same thing at port columbus yknow i sil id see sil all these cars 
but it would be just about the same traffic and im like sil and i 
mentioned somebody i go sil where are the extra airplanes and they go they cant 
add extra airplanes sil its sil they have certain routes they can do they just 
hafta cutoffbbe sil put sil bigger airplanes on sil so he said sil yknow youll 
see larger airplanes when its sil holiday time so they can sil put more people 
on sil so iver oh yeah sil yeah iver sil iver iver i know i 
dont vocnoise iver sil i sil i guess its just sil over the course of 
the year everything balances out vocnoiseyknow sil so iver umhum iver uh vocnoise iver until 
they start sil getting sil a little bit better equipment because the equipment is really 
ancient i mean theres stuff there thats older than i am laughyknow laugh sil so 
but they like uh port columbus is getting a new tower sil and theyre its 
supposed be done in about three and a half years and the equipment theyre getting 
is sil all brand new stuff its not like theyre taking all the old junk 
weve got sil and moving it over there so sil yknow that will help and 
sil and vocnoise sil nationwide theyre also putting new stuff in but the bad part 
is is sil um sil picture your father sil is your father computer literate sil 
okay sil hes sil hes at his job and tomorrow morning they come in and 
they go sil everybodys gonna put sil all their work sil on computer sil well 
sil iver sil his speed was like say sil seventy mile an hour before and 
now its gonna be sil twenty sil because he doesnt know how to do it 
and thats the problem theyre running into they have all these qualified people who know 
how to separate airplanes and how to get them in sil trail and sil yknow 
everything sil but now theyve gotta do this sil extra part sil which is going 
to make their job easier sil down the road sil but everybody hates change sil 
so what theyre doing now is sil it sil theyre having problems because sil people 
cant take the volume of airplanes because theyre trying to keep up with the computer 
so its making it even slower yet but once they get in sil yknow in 
the swing of things itll be okay but sil yknow youre sil youre talking a 
while yknow because its not something that you can do overnight but itd be like 
your dad learning the computer hes not going to do it overnight iver and iver 
right and if he unknown sil if hes open minded enough to do it sil 
eventually hell see the light and say sil boy this would make it a lot 
easier but sil there are people who are like sil i will not sil do 
this vocnoise yknow vocnoise so sil those the ones that sil hafta be drug screaming 
and kicking iver iver right iver umhum sil laugh iver right sil umhum theres a 
lot of uh sil money vocnoise sil money in town here and theres sometimes like 
youll see sil a uh unknown sil one sil entire sil airplane that goes to 
cancun sil and its like people are going on vacation or people who are gonna 
go gambling in jamaica sil thats all it is sil so then when that comes 
in we have these really weird painted airplanes and were like sil who sil is 
that iver sil and theyll go thats transmeridian and we go vocnoise write that down 
because i dont know that name yknow so sil umhum iver umhum sil right iver 
i vocnoise sil vocnoise the sil accents sometimes but uh sil they they uh theyre 
okay i mean no cutoffbibig sil no big problem but uh the the accent sometime 
its like sil um sil theres sort of a uh sil running sil joke i 
dont know if i should say this but its like sil if i can talk 
like excludethis sil and uh talk sil all the time like this vocnoise why is 
it that they cant talk like sil we do sil yknow its like yknow if 
i could if i could talk that way noisebecause we cutoffhahave do have pilots that 
do talk like iver and iver sil sometimes sil its even easier to understand them 
because their they enunciate so well sil but uh yknow sil it thats something weve 
never understood yknow if we can sil fake that accent iver why cant they fake 
ours to make it easier for sil us to understand but sil yknow sil but 
no usually theres no problem sil the only problem you usually have is like somebody 
like yourself sil who has never flown sil and is taking lessons sil and you 
sil you have about ten or fifteen hours sil and we tell you to do 
something and you like sil um sil well sil i think i know what they 
mean so ill just keep flying and it thats the worst thing you can do 
the best thing to do is say sil okay sil i heard what you said 
sil but im brand new at this and ive got no idea what you mean 
can you try it again and theyll go okay now we know where youre coming 
from sil and theyll make it really easy for you because if they just yknow 
unknown sil yknow zoom out some phraseology and you go sil nine eight juliet which 
is sil the sil cutoffwhwhat how you respond with a call signing the airplane iver 
they go shes got it and they go on to the next guy and then 
all a sudden youre going off this way and they go uh six nine juliet 
uh cutoffwwhere sil where are you going and youre like uh sil i uh told 
me to and then they go oh brother yknow so now vocnoise yknow sil the 
attention is diverted to you so sil thats usually what the problem is because sil 
most pilots are there are really professional yeah sil umhum iver oh understanding iver yeah 
iver umhum sil we dont really have that much yknow the foreign ones sil um 
sil it sil itd probably be like maybe sil two or three percent of our 
total sil pilot iver yeah sil vocnoise sil umhum right iver no iver um i 
used to be a charter pilot and a flight instructor sil and i used to 
go to work at like eight oclock in the morning and get home for my 
first meal with johnny carson sil and i did this six days a week sil 
and to get my unknown sil my one day off i would get up at 
like at seven oclock get in my car and drive to the mall and park 
and sleep in my car iver because i i didnt own a telephone sil because 
i couldnt afford one and sil and also i thought if i had one theyll 
call me sil well they would come yknow if i didnt get up that time 
on my day off theyd come knocking at the door and say we need you 
to come for a trip iver so yknow one day um sil it was a 
really bad day id gone sil to like tulsa oklahoma with somebody and came back 
and yknow i sil like i said i hadnt had sil anything to eat the 
entire day sil and uh it was like sil it was like midnight and i 
got home and i thought oh im too hungry sil yknow to sil im too 
tired and hungry and i just thought uh im not making anything so i just 
went to bed sil and uh sil a guy knocked on my door sil which 
he lived upstairs in the apartment above me and he tell me excludename are you 
in there sil and i wouldnt answer sil well it was a real cheap apartment 
he took a credit card and punched the uh sil the sil door knob and 
iver opened it up and it sil grabbed on the chain and he reached in 
and flipped the lights on iver and he goes excludename do you hear me sil 
and i go yeah and he goes you got a trip be out the airport 
at four thirty sil and i go vocnoiseahgroan he says you hear me and i 
go sil yeah uh yeah sil he goes sil well get some sleep and he 
turns the lights off pulls the door shut sil and uh sil im laying there 
and im like sil ive been home like three hours and now im just fuming 
sil and i thought sil i know sil a college education doesnt guarantee you sil 
financial security sil but i thought sil what am i doing sil working sil yknow 
from dust sil i mean dawn to sil way past dusk six days a week 
and making nothing and having people like this come tell me sil you gotta go 
to work tomorrow sil so i sil went upstairs and knocked on his door and 
sil told him i quit laugh and uh he wasnt very thrilled about that but 
one of my students was a uh sil controller sil and uh sil he came 
and talked to me and he says uh sil he says i know sil i 
heard you quit he says i want to sil tell you about sil my job 
and he was a controller at sil owensboro kentucky sil and uh he said he 
worked forty hours a week and i go sil well sil i usually do that 
by wednesday sil and he said that he had uh sil annual leave sil and 
sick leave and i sil said what are iver sil and he said that he 
had a health plan and i said what is that sil and i sil he 
said he had insurance sil life insurance and i go sil what is that sil 
so he goes sil yknow we really need to get you over here so thats 
how i sil i went and took the test and sil started that way sil 
iver well sil actually sil anybody can try sil yknow there is a civil service 
exam you hafta take sil and they place you on a list from that sil 
and like say if you have an sil eighty sil well everybody that takes it 
after you that gets an eighty one sil is gonna get hired before you do 
sil uh so you can take it again but if you score lower you gotta 
keep that lower score so and that sometimes people are sil yknow kind of sil 
apprehensive about doing that but sil uh once you pass that and then they say 
sil yknow the government goes okay were ready to hire sil a thousand people sil 
throughout the united states well each sil region theres regions in the united states they 
may get like thirty for the great lakes region sil so they go down the 
list the first thirty and they call sil yknow they write each one of them 
and say sil were offering you a position sil yknow do you want it or 
not and yknow some the people have said well vocnoise ive been on the list 
for two years and i have a cutoffjjob sil yknow like you i have a 
job and i sil dont want it now yknow so sil and then those people 
hafta go to oklahoma city to the academy and go through a screening program sil 
which is really hard sil because vocnoise at one time only forty percent of the 
people were making it through that iver yeah sil so sil its sil its a 
really tough thing to do sil i mean you hafta be sil sort of organized 
sil and sil i dont know sort of a maverick i guess because sil if 
sil if you could sil give a test that would tell who could be an 
air vocnoise traffic controller who couldnt youd be a millionaire because the government would buy 
that from you sil because sil intelligence sil is not a factor cutoffththere i mean 
there are people who do this job sil who sil i mean are not stupid 
sil but theyre not sil college educated and really intelligent but theyre extreme good at 
it sil and then the other people uh that sil i know of one sil 
that i work with cutoffeevery on a regular basis he is sil got a masters 
degree and hes sil yknow sil he cutoffb reads continuously hes sil always up i 
mean if you ask him anything about like sil whats going on on sil overseas 
or anywhere sil he knows that like the back of his hand sil but hes 
one of our weakest ones sil yknow and its um iver right sil and sil 
and also the other thing is you cutoffhahave sil you hafta be sort of compassionate 
because like sil yknow youre sil youre working a lot of airplanes and youre wanting 
answers like this when you errorspiutspit something out you want an answer sil yknow cutoffththe 
each airplane is supposed to respond with their call sign like if i tell somebody 
yknow turn left heading three six zero and hes supposed to respond t w a 
three ninety six roger sil well if he doesnt sil respond sil then ive got 
to say it again which means instead of sil ten airplanes i now have eleven 
im talking to because sil i hafta tell them sil talk to them two times 
each sil so yknow there are some people that get sil really mad laugh sil 
quick because they want noise that answer like that sil where sil yknow sil i 
was a pilot so sometimes im thinking yknow vocnoise vocnoise youre in there flying and 
youre unknownpilots turning and youre putting your flaps down and i go six nine eight 
juliet uh say your altitude and youre like um vocnoise sil cutoffdidid sil did they 
call me sil yknow because you have a lot of things going on sil and 
im not id im im mister laid back in that area had a lot of 
people go i dont see how you can be so calm sil but sil yknow 
i always look at it though as yknow sil i can scare you to death 
and youll never come back to columbus sil or any sil airport that has a 
tower sil or i can be nice to you and you can go out and 
spread the word that sil yknow sil there unknown sil theres some people there that 
are pretty iver yknow so i figure sil its sil its much better to be 
nice to them because sil theres also times when yknow everybody makes sil errors sil 
and yknow sil maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell 
you to turn one way and you go uh sil yknow like theres an airplane 
over there and i tell you to turn that way sil and sil i really 
meant for you turn left instead of right and sil you may come back and 
go uh cutoffddo sil do you do you mean left or right there and sil 
i go sil vocnoise yes that is cutoffrright sil correct turn left yknow unknownheuh so 
yknow sil everybody helps everybody out yknow i i feel kindness goes a long way 
sil and the pilots the same way cutoffthetheyre cutoffmomost sil most often theyre sil yknow 
pretty decent iver no sil i dont i just got too expensive sil yeah iver 
iver iver ive never unknowni sil ive never known of him iver iver we dont 
know whos in the airplane and there but there are c planes that do come 
in and out of there iver very often i mean maybe like theres like one 
or two that come sil during the year iver but iver yeah i dont iver 
iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah sil now if you sil the the the thing 
you do is if you know the call sign iver and you know sil about 
what time sil of the year hes coming in iver you could call the operations 
over there and say sil yknow sil is this airplane on the ground sil iver 
sil and you sil you could actually walk out and take a picture of it 
over there now at port columbus you couldnt do that sil but you could over 
there sil because you can walk around on the ramp over there sil at o 
s u iver sil sunday vocnoise iver uh nothing for a cutoffwhiwhile i dont want 
to do anything until past january sil yknow because ive sil i sil like sil 
said it since nineteen seventy four ive never had thanksgiving sil christmas sil or new 
years off without having to work either sil a seven to three sil or a 
three to eleven sil yknow and its like i sil i figure i deserve this 
sil yknow its about time i get to sil not eat uh thanksgiving dinner at 
sil ten thirty in the morning so i can go to cutoffnoonoon sil uh go 
to work at noon or something yknow or sil or open the christmas presents uh 
sil yknow at five oclock in the afternoon because i work christmas day so yknow 
sil i think its sil my time iver yeah and sil yknow id sil i 
would like to have another job but i would sil i would love sil i 
know youll say this is really stupid sil but i would love to have a 
monday through friday sil eight to five job never work another evening sil a saturday 
or a sunday sil if sil if it can be now i know ill probably 
not be able to do that because sil o s u wants me to come 
back there so sil as a contractor so sil i dont know sil yknow iver 
you mean at o s u iver oh yeah i would have to work shift 
work sil yeah sil so iver yeah iver umhum iver right sil yeah iver media 
hype iver yeah sil there is theres like two people who are like sil from 
the uh sil cutoffththey i mean theyre not sil old but theyre like from the 
forties and they have bought generators theyve bought water theyve got extra food theyve got 
a cutofffreezefreezer sil extra freezers they bought ammunition its like sil hello vocnoise yknow i 
just think its iver sil yknow the only thing im going to do sil is 
maybe two weeks before i might get a hundred dollars from the bank machine sil 
and uh sil i have three cars so ill probably have one of them full 
of gas sil and other than that its like sil yknow to me sil if 
you are say bank one sil and im huntington sil and january the cutoffssecond sil 
second sil people have all kinds of problems sil you and i are going to 
be the laughing stock of the corporate america sil and do you really think you 
and i want to do that sil so to me sil nobodys gonna have a 
problem because sil excludeyears theyre gonna go vocnoise sil remember bank one vocnoise sil yknow 
you go get ten bucks and you get five hundred out the machine sil uh 
yknow its like who wants to do business with them nobodys gonna do that sil 
yeah yknow maybe some little company sil um that sil really doesnt sil yknow have 
a big impact but sil i dont see where anythings gonna happen at all yknow 
iver iver yeah sil iver i mean there are people who think cars wont run 
iver and its like sil a car has a computer sil but it does not 
know sil if it is sil uh monday sil or sil two thousand and fifty 
it has no idea it sil it means nothing its not date sensitive yknow sil 
so iver vocnoise shes a librarian at sil an elementary school sil one block from 
our house iver umhum iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise it cutoffwwas it is she doesnt even 
drive to work sil yknow iver so iver uh shes undecided right now sil um 
iver right umhum sil at o yeah uh iver she really likes it well sil 
yeah iver she went to excludename sil columbus alternative high school iver right umhum iver 
uh college without the tuition sil iver so hard sil i mean sil every summer 
sil they have homework sil that has to be done sil or else the first 
grading period sil is an f sil and when sil uh my unknown yeah oldest 
daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had 
a teaching academy there sil vocnoise and once she got into it she went sil 
uh maybe not laugh so i said well what yknow whatever sil so then she 
wanted to go to excludename because its basically sil a columbus sil public school thats 
geared to sil college only i mean if sil if youre not going to college 
sil dont go there because you will flunk out its very hard sil and she 
got in sil the second year sil three weeks before school started sil and so 
we go over there and they hand her this stack of sil material thats got 
to be done in three weeks sil so i thought sil well ill just call 
and i called and i talked to the principal and i said yknow they gave 
us all this stuff and yknow sil everybody else has had sil june july sil 
august to get this done and shes got three weeks and she goes sil and 
the principal goes thats correct sil and i go sil well theres no way she 
can get this done and cutoffii i said yknow everybody else has sil had all 
this time and shes gonna get it done in three weeks and they go sil 
thats right sil so they take vocnoise sil theres no excuses sil yknow sil and 
its sil it is very hard i know my youngest daughter sil who is just 
as smart as my oldest would do horrible there because sil yknow basically they say 
uh were talking about china this week sil and uh sil on december the fifteenth 
sil we want a report on sil why chinese people do what they do sil 
yknow and its like sil and every week they dont come by and go have 
you started sil have you started sil have you started do you have the outline 
vocnoise right sil and its up to you to go gosh i have to have 
an outline i have to bibliography i have to have the facts i have to 
interview some people sil and if you dont sit down with a little calendar and 
go sil this week im getting this done this week im getting this done and 
this sil you just sil fail sil so my oldest daughter vocnoise is sil pretty 
uh sil detail oriented so sil after we kind of cutoffhehelped cutoffhhelped helped her start 
yknow and say yknow youre youre gonna hafta sil do these things sil so you 
get this done and i said and basically get it done like sil two weeks 
before its done so then you can say sil oh sil this isnt very good 
and sil yknow amend it or whatever or sil or vocnoise help somebody sil yknow 
get somebody with typing whatever so shes really good and its sil its helped her 
at school sil a lot sil because i know they sil uh she sil she 
toured here at ohio state and there were some people here that cutoffwwere sil come 
from cahs and they go sil this will be easier than your highschool laugh sil 
so iver hum iver umhum iver umhum iver yeah iver umhum iver yeah iver no 
because sil um sil all the kids take that errorcutoffcalivorncalifornia sil california achievement test i 
dont know if youre familiar with that and its like yknow because sil its sil 
say like you and i go to school you go to sil you go to 
dublin and i go to the worst school in columbus sil and we both make 
straight as sil well when you take the california achievement test sil that really the 
sil as mean nothing sil because its like sil lets see what you understand and 
have learned sil the score on that is what really matters to me sil and 
both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those sil because yknow they always 
pick on sil columbus public schools they go oh its so look how bad their 
test scores sil well sil yknow sil if you take sil say like uh sil 
the worst school in town which i dont know what it what it would be 
but lets just say its uh sil brown school sil well you have sil children 
there who have not seen dad in probably sil ten years sil and mom is 
sil basically sil sometimes there sil or in prison so they live with grandma sil 
how do you expect them to do well sil nobodys there to yknow im not 
a uh sil yknow like sil an ogre or anything but yknow sil i always 
keep sil tabs on my kids yknow like ive always gone to conferences sil even 
though they got straight as sil i go to conferences and teachers go well what 
do you come for and i go sil if i dont come then its like 
saying sil i dont really care sil so i always go sil so they know 
that im sil keeping tabs on things and i dont demand as sil i just 
demand them sil to do their best and i said yknow if your best is 
a c then thats what it will be but i said if your best is 
an a and youre getting a c sil you got me to talk to so 
sil uh back to the brown school sil uh there are kids like my daughter 
there who make sil straight as sil and when they take the sil um sil 
what is that thing the proficiency test sil zoom through it and get like outstanding 
on it sil and uh then you have sil uh cutoffthithis this probably sounds really 
sil biased or sil bigoted but cutoffyyou then you have sil the kid whose sil 
mom and dad arent together and sil and he comes to school maybe sil twice 
a week sil and when he takes proficiency test he gets like a vocnoiseththirty thirty 
on it vocnoise sil and his report card hes got like a one point two 
five average sil so they take sil jalena who has an a sil him who 
has a d and they go well gee the average cutoffsstudent kid in the school 
is like c plus sil and theyre stupid at this school columbus public schools dont 
do any good sil then you go to dublin worthington westerville sil in order to 
get there you sil youre not gonna be sil in his condition vocnoise and youre 
not gonna be stupid because youre trying to sil yknow sil you probably both husband 
and wife work sil so the intelligence is there sil and youre not gonna have 
dumb people sil living sil and going to those schools because its very expensive live 
in that area sil so theres a natural prejudice that columbus is stupid sil and 
worthington dublin and its really sil not true sil its just that sil yknow sil 
you cant sil tell all the poor people sil and the people that dont have 
sil two parents dont come to school because we want our scores higher sil but 
yknow when the vocnoise and when the news media goes look how bad brown school 
did this year sil but they dont look to see sil like jalena sil they 
dont go well look at sil the uh scores on the california achievement tests theres 
like sil seventy five percent the kids that are getting like sil yknow nineties and 
above sil but twenty five percent are getting sil fs and ds iver so it 
brings that cutoffdodown and its uh like yknow theyre theyre not comparing it fairly if 
you would take all the people who are making the same score on sil the 
test at both schools sil ill bet you theyre all about the same iver iver 
sil because like i think its archie griffin that went to a really crummy school 
in uh sil in in columbus sil and to me sil no matter how sil 
bad of an area you live in and and cutoffbabad bad a cutoffsschool bad a 
school you think youre going to sil if you want to do it sil you 
can because it and vocnoise really in columbus public schools sil if you have a 
learning disability sil or yknow if you have problems reading or you have problems at 
home there is sil a psychologist sil or a tutor or something to help you 
and sil and in uh like sil worthington and westerville dublin sil yknow sil they 
dont have the money to throw away and like catholic schools they dont have the 
money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get sil 
pushed aside and sil so yknow sil as you can see im standing on my 
soapbox here i do like columbus public schools but yknow i sil i i hate 
when people say yknow look at these test scores because it really doesnt reflect whats 
there because sil its like saying all kids carry guns to school sil they dont 
sil yknow and the media says well what has there been like maybe sil five 
or six sil people who have taken guns to school and killed people sil well 
what about the uh sil millions and millions of kids that go to school every 
day sil do their homework sil and yknow sil do community service and stuff well 
well unknown well thats just to boring we dont want to hear that stuff sil 
yknow sil its like sil that that irritates me laugh iver oh laugh iver there 
we go iver umhum iver umhum iver right iver umhum iver right iver umhum iver 
uh they really have no self worth sil because sil yknow uh i uh i 
know a long time ago uh we went to a um sil uh cutoffsseminar sil 
what was cutoffthathat its like a unknown a seminar sil for the sil ivy league 
schools which sil i looked at the tuition and went sil vocnoise yknow there was 
no way but sil and i thought this is so stupid to be here but 
i listened to the man sil cutoffthethere there was like four or five men talking 
and some women talking whatever and uh sil they said yknow sil if your cutoffkkid 
sil if your child makes straight as sil and uh sil applies at our school 
sil we dont want them sil and im like sil what sil he says uh 
sil he says we look at two sil two children sitting side by side this 
ones making straight as sil this one sort of made bs sil but this one 
over here got into track when sil he or she was in freshmans sil and 
sil and we noticed sil every track meet sil they basically cutoffwawas sil were like 
sil last sil or second to last sil but they did it for four years 
sil then they cutoffwwere iver yeah sil and and never got any better sil then 
they got in marching band sil and they were in that for four years sil 
and sometimes we notice they marched and sometimes they didnt because they didnt learn their 
music sil but they stayed with it sil and they said then they like volunteered 
down at cosi sil they didnt get paid a dime for this sil but they 
did it because they enjoyed sil helping and definite so like they go sil we 
want that student over there sil said you as a straight a student have proved 
nothing to us sil and you over there as a b student have proved that 
sil by gosh sil yknow youll try out for something sil and if you dont 
do well you go sil but i like doing it sil and im gonna keep 
with it sil yknow sil and to me sil the straight a student who does 
nothing sil is like the kids who sil go to school and shoot people sil 
they have nothing in their life sil at all and the other one has sil 
yknow activities and sil theyre giving of themselves to the community yknow sil vocnoise yknow 
like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library cutoffrreading sil reading program 
and then they went on and they volunteer at cosi and sil and my oldest 
one was in key club and they would have like sil easter egg hunts for 
sil the sil excludename school is a grade school and its attached to cutoffcocolumbus vocnoise 
columbus alternative high school sil so sil um yknow i cutoffreread i read an sil 
um sil uh a uh resume that she sil put in sil for a scholarship 
and it was explaining how sil the sil the closest she got to crying at 
school was sil when she would sil uh sil do these projects because she says 
there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy sil and cutoffiit sil 
it was just sil they were just so excited that sil the kids went out 
and bought like a dollar or twos worth of candy and hid it out and 
theyd have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says sil yknow 
those and things that sil were important to her and sil yknow sil to me 
that makes sil you feel like youre worth something but the kids that go yknow 
the ones who went to school i sil yknow i dont see any sil community 
service or sil i dont know about sil i im not a big sil gung 
ho have to be religious person i mean i i feel im a christian but 
im not a church goer sil and i dont think you hafta go there to 
be sil a religious person sil yknow but uh yknow i think sil religion and 
community service and sil feeling like you have given something to the community and sil 
yknow youre just not sil asking continuously for it yknow and and trying things sil 
and failing at them sil and going okay well sil but i still like to 
sil play basketball sil im sil terrible but i like to play and i cant 
make the team so what do i do i know ill go to the y 
and play there sil yknow sil that sil thats sil what keeps kids out of 
trouble sil and those that go to school and come home and either sit on 
the computer and sil yknow what sil do the chat room stuff or the e 
mail stuff or sit on the playing with video games i think those the ones 
that are the big problem children because they yknow mom and dad go sil how 
can i get them to do something sil and stay out of my hair sil 
oh i know ill buy them a nintendo sil ill buy them this sega ill 
buy this look theyre out of my way yknow because sil yknow iver oh yeah 
sil and sil and i ill probably step on your toes here but i im 
not a firm believer of mom and dad both working sil i my wife worked 
sil until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school 
she worked sil at a school sil so when they were gone she was gone 
when they were home she was home sil and yknow my parents didnt do that 
and i hated it sil i hated coming home from school by myself every day 
sil there was nobody there to talk to yknow and i did it for years 
and sil and sil i just feel that sil yknow sil i i hope you 
dont have children yet sil do you sil good sil because vocnoise to me parents 
who sil put kids in daycare sil and sil uh yknow after school programs sil 
are like people who have cats and dogs sil i get up in the morning 
sil and i feed my sil pet sil my child sil then i put him 
in the kennel sil and i go to work sil and i go gee id 
like to go for some drinks after work or go to a movie sil well 
just put her in another kennel after work and we take her from one kennel 
to the other kennel we go well be back a little bit sil and then 
i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at 
the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off iver sil and 
feed her sil and i go sil dont bother me sil ive had a bad 
day and im tired sil you go watch t v sil and how are we 
raising children sil doing that yknow sil yknow and cutoffssay people say uh you hafta 
have both those incomes because we hafta do this i go sil well why do 
you hafta have a house thats three hundred thousand dollars sil why do you have 
have a brand new car sil yknow isnt life sacrifices cutoffathat sil arent sil arent 
you supposed to like sil do best for your children yknow i mean i my 
children dont have everything they dont have a sil sega sil yknow my daughter has 
a car that goes to excludename sil and its twelve years old sil yknow sil 
and i made her buy it sil i told her i says sil i will 
not buy you a car sil i said if you want a car you hafta 
buy it sil and i said when its time for maintenance you have to pay 
for it sil because sil she has to be responsible for things sil and she 
appreciates that yknow and sil yknow sil i admire her i mean shes the sil 
person i sil never was that age yknow noise but sil yknow and sil id 
sil i dont take sil full responsibility for that but iver im very proud of 
the way her and her sister are but sil i just think its because mom 
was home sil and sil yknow there was somebody there to listen to them and 
it doesnt have to be mom i mean sil um sil yknow sil mom can 
go work sil and dad can stay home sil theres nothing wrong with that either 
but i just think they need sil mom or dad there everyday when they come 
home so they know when they come home and theyve had a really bad day 
and somethings really bothering them sil they can talk to it as opposed to sitting 
for two or three hours sil and letting it kind of fade away and then 
when everybody comes home its like well sil how hows school sil okay iver yknow 
sil anything bothering you vocnoise no sil yknow sil so sil vocnoise iver oh there 
we go sil okay iver umhum iver yeah sil well youre very smart sil yknow 
iver yeah iver umhum iver yeah iver right sil and cutoffiit well sil and theres 
nothing wrong with that iver oh yeah iver umhum iver umhum iver yeah iver right 
iver umhum iver oh yeah iver right iver right sil umhum iver exactly sil umhum 
iver right sil and its all the bucks sil yeah because people i work with 
yknow sil uh sil there uh there are some people i work with that house 
payments sil one guy he has the biggest vocnoise sil twenty two hundred dollars a 
month sil and a lot of them have like sil fifteen hundred and up sil 
and yknow sil i bought my house sil years and years ago and its like 
four eighty five sil and i wouldnt dare tell them that sil but its like 
yknow they because theyre always sil at sil yknow there are people there that make 
a lot more money than i do and sil and theyre always like sil broke 
sil but yet yknow like when they go do something theyve gotta have the best 
of everything the best of cutoffththat its like yknow sil yknow you i unknown sil 
to me you just hafta kind of think about things little bit and its like 
sil yknow do i sil do i really need to go to um sil oh

everything that has a coupon has sil tons of fat sil tons of sugar sil 
and is overpriced sil iver iver yeah iver right sil well heres sil heres a 
can of manwich its a dollar fifty and well give you fifty cents off sil 
well sil gee sil if i just use the recipe out the microwave cookbook sil 
i can make it at home for like three cents sil but but yknow why 
sil its convenience sil i can throw it in the microwave and itll be done 
in five minutes yknow like mashed potatoes the microwave or yknow its like hello its 
sil yknow sil i cutoffccan i can understand how people do it because sil they 
come home from work sil and its like sil i dont want to be a 
cook sil i dont want to be a clean up so ill pay somebody do 
this pay somebody do that and pretty soon you see sil all the money theyve 
been making sil gone iver yknow and iver yeah iver yeah iver umhum iver oh 
my gosh they just iver price is so high iver right iver right sil exactly 
sil oh youre sil youre in our neighborhood laugh sil yeah youre unknown exactly sil 
oh iver well sil we use iver im trying to think cutoffiit it theyre cutoffmeimeijer 
sil its a meijer brand i know thats what we have sil its like fruit 
os instead of uh cutoffffruit iver fruit loops sil yeah sil and its like what 
sil is the difference yknow sil besides the price iver it is yeah iver right 
iver right iver well yknow my and my girls sil there are certain products that 
sil brand name like sil uh one of them i know is the meijer sil 
uh pudding that you can uh take cutofftto for lunches which they do sil and 
its like edventure sil yknow sil adventure but its edventure sil well sil every once 
in while hunts will be sil the same price sil and theyll be a coupon 
in the paper sil so joyce will or joyce or i we vocnoise we trade 
she goes the grocery store sil once then sil next two weeks i go vocnoise 
and the next two weeks she goes sil so um sil shell uh cutoffshshe yknow 
shell buy stuff like that with a coupon and she goes sil and i go 
why are you buying that and she goes sil it was cheaper than the sil 
meijer brand sil and then when we sil eat it sil its like sil its 
too sweet sil yknow or its too overpowering or too sugary sil and the girls 
even they the same way they would go we dont like this its too chocolatey 
sil so yknow like the manwich stuff its like they just sil pour sugar in 
it i guess because thats what people like and so i find that sil the 
unbrand stuff well not unbrand but sil its all like a meijer brand or something 
like that or food club or something like that sil iver iver yeah iver oh 
we do too we make vegetable soup and vocnoise chili iver oh yeah iver yeah 
iver right iver yeah iver right iver exactly iver yeah iver well see sil the 
iver you sil youre sil youre intelligent sil yknow iver and the house smells wonderful 
sil yknow sil its like cakes uh birthday cakes yknow i think sil but my 
i think my wifes was the last one i sil i make her one and 
yknow we sil we trade off and i bought sil a um sil um what 
is it betty crocker sil at odd lots sil it was twenty two cents sil 
the icing was twenty two cents i made it and everybody goes sil this is 
really good its like a sour cream icing i go yeah and they go boy 
this is really good they go did you buy this and i go no i 
made it they go sil really like oh yeah it cost me forty four cents 
iver and i go the same cake at meijer would have been like seven dollars 
or something like that and yknow sil but uh yknow im sil i dont try 
to be the sil the cheapskate i mean i wont go without health plan or 
anything like that but yknow there are certain cutoffaareas sil like my car i love 
cars and sil yknow sil you cutoffccan take the car to carwash its like seven 
fifty or eight bucks and you wash in the driveway and its about a quarter 
sil yknow its like sil it takes time sil if you sil if you have 
no time and yknow that i sil i have friends at work that sil their 
cutoffmmom the mom is a taxi cab driver sil and the dad is the worker 
bee sil and when they get home they dont want to do anything so they 
pay to have the yard done they do this vocnoise and its like they have 
and then they always go we have no money sil and its like sil because 
youd sil pay to do everything yknow slow your life down a little bit yknow 
sil its sil its like you making your soup vocnoise yknow sil when if and 
when you have children sil when they get my age theyre gonna go sil i 
can remember walking around the house and going sil mom is making bean soup sil 
or mom is making vegetable soup or mom baked a cake sil its like sil 
uh as opposed to sil vocnoise sil open it up sil oh heres a meijer 
cake sil yknow laugh iver its a lot of memories iver umhum iver laugh iver 
iver iver yeah iver right sil i have a neighbor thats that way iver sil 
i cutoffknknow well to me sil the cholesterol level sil and the health sil from 
that food has gotta be so bad i mean sil uh my my only downfall 
is i love taco bell sil so when im like sil working out in the 
yard sil and mowing and edging and trimming and wash the car and its look 
up at my watch and i go sil oh hell i deserve a break im 
going out to lunch sil well most people would go somewhere really expensive i go 
sil what sil laugh i want a mexican pizza and a coke laugh laughyknow cutofflilike 
so thats my big treat sil but uh yknow i um sil i im not 
a big sil fan of eating out either i mean we do like to go 
to chinese restaurant but sil and uh when i go we have something nice but 
um sil yknow were not cheap but we dont go vocnoise like we cutoffdodont sil 
we do go to movies every once in a while but yknow we do get 
a lot from the library sil because theyre free sil but uh yknow like theyre 
iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah iver right sil like magazines iver i i love 
read magazines and my wife loves reading magazines because i love all the car magazines 
sil and theyre a fortune sil and theyre all at the library sil yknow its 
like people just dont sil you pay all these taxes sil and you dont use 
this stuff sil i mean sil the library has c ds sil i mean sil 
uh vocnoise my thing now is sil uh sil in traffic everybody gets all upset 
that this big road rage crap sil yknow which is just sil and id just 
love to slap a couple of them people but anyway sil and what i do 
is sil i go to the library on my day off and i get two 
or three books on tape sil and when im sitting there i go sil oh 
good sil its a traffic jam and im not moving as im iver iver yeah 
sil and im going oh this is really interesting yknow and then ill drive along 
and people are just like vocnoise and blowing the horns and im like well i 
could cutoffcacare careless this means i get to hear more of my book iver and 
sil why dont people use their time yknow and sil its free sil yknow sil 
rather they get all sil tensed up and mad because sil they left five minutes 
late and expect everybody to get out of the way because they got to get 
there yknow iver umhum iver umhum sil uh well my oldest one this is sil 
really odd because sil uh the school she goes to sil its sort of like 
uh thrift store vocnoise sil chic sil and a lot of kids there go to 
thrift stores and buy their clothes and i told her i said yknow sil we 
are not in the poor house youre not buying clothes in the thrift store sil 
so she basically went through my closet and took sil everything that was old of 
mine sil and wore it sil and i thought oh my gosh yknow because she 
just looks like a bum vocnoise i think sil and yknow when it was time 
for like a um sil a sil a dance or something sil she would go 
out and buy sil a dress yknow at sil pennys or someplace at the mall 
yknow and maybe spend like eighty dollars for a dress sil and the same thing 
would happen sil every time she would go and come home id go what did 
they say sil yknow about sil your dress and she goes sil jalena sil is 
that you sil and i go see you clean up really nice i said yknow 
you have the best shape youre ever gone have in your life and what do 
you do you wear these big baggy clothes and these saggy pants i said sil 
yknow when you get sil when you get in your fifties and youve got a 
gut and a big ass laughyknow you could do that iver why are you doing 
it now but sil and then my my my youngest one she likes to dress 
sil totally different shes sort of like uh little bit of a preppy sil but 
she sil uh does not understand why people want to have sil like sil izod 
on their shirt sil or yknow a name on their pants sil and she says 
sil i just think thats stupid she says you can buy nice clothes sil without 
that vocnoise so vocnoise shes sil neither one of them pressure me and uh sil 
the one thing that was really sil odd when they errorrawere little is sil we 
would go like to toys r us sil and sil up and down the rows 
sil and sil i see kids its like in y yknow vocnoise and they would 
walk over sil and pick something up and go sil and then put it back 
down sil and keep walking and its like yknow i told joyce i says yknow 
i feel like im an sil ogre because sil are they terrified to even sil 
ask for this stuff sil and she goes no she says sil they dont want 
it sil she says they just want to see what its like sil yknow because 
their favorite toy when they were little is i would go to um sil um 
sil what do you call it lazy boy sil and get five or six of 
them killer boxes from the sofas and the chairs sil and take a knife sil 
and cut doors in it sil and they would play with that for weeks yknow 
sil until somebody one of their friends would come over and have a little accident 
and then we go well we hafta build a new house but yknow sil they 
just sil reading and playing with stuff like that they they enjoyed yknow so iver 
right sil yeah sil yeah well my oldest my oldest daughter is the biggest cheapskate 
sil yknow sil because sil i keep asking her when i sil yknow when i 
call her on the phone or i sil e mail her every day sil yknow 
and she goes sil i said do you are you out of money and she 
goes sil well i have like three dollars but im not going to the bank 
machine because youre picking me up tuesday sil and im not paying a two noisedollar 
service errorcheechargefee sil service errorshcharge uh charge to get money sil out sil ill wait 
till i get home and im like sil yknow sil i cant complain iver uh 
sil yeah yeah sil because if she was theyre charging her two bucks down there 
and i told her i says you need to really not get twenty dollars out 
at a time sil because i said you need to get like sixty or eighty 
sil because i says you get eighty bucks out youre gonna pay sil eight dollars 
for it twenty bucks at a time but if you get eighty bucks out youre 
gonna get two bucks and she goes but if i have eighty dollars ill spend 
it sil and i says well you have a footlocker with a lock on it 
sil put sil seventy dollars sil in there sil and have ten on you and 
shes like sil oh and i said sil the errorreasareason i know thats because thats 
what dads gotta do laugh i said i cant carry money or ill spend it 
yknow iver oh yeah by the iver sil oh yeah iver yeah iver oh yeah 
iver right iver umhum iver right iver yeah iver yeah iver yeah right because sil 
uh cutoffttake sil youd like sil uh i sil i always keep using my oldest 
daughter sil uh she can unknown uh sil get up in the morning sil and 
brush her teeth sil and just sil barely comb her hair put on a shirt 
sil and a pair of pants sil and go somewhere sil because shes comfortable with 
herself sil she doesnt hafta be made up sil she doesnt hafta look perfect now 
my youngest one hasta do that sil and and the oldest one i look at 
her as sil yknow sil i like myself sil and sil if you dont like 
me sil well sil then move on sil maybe somebody else sil does sil and 
thats way im gonna be yknow and and cutoffthethen like i said she can clean 
up and look like a beauty queen sil but she can also look sil just 
sil like vocnoise yknow just sil basically yknow like sil she was sil raking leaves 
ten minutes ago sil and my other one will not leave the house sil without 
looking perfect and i just think thats sort of sil shallow because sil yknow i 
look at people who got to yknow they hafta have the face lifts and they 
got to have the perfect hair and they got to have the perfect clothes its 
like sil youre so sil insecure about sil the sil image you present that youve 
got to be perfect and by gosh if your hair is out of place youre 
gonna be sil out of the loop sil and yknow if sil if people were 
just a little more comfortable with themselves sil yknow and ive like im a big 
one to talk i was like mister insecure for unknown sil thirty years at least 
then i finally got the point and i went oh the hell with it yknow 
its too much work sil yknow you either like me or dont if you dont 
go to somebody else and sil yknow unknown sil a lot of people are uh 
are really worried and yknow sil i dont know if boys so much but i 
know girls are really worried about what people think of them sil and how they 
look sil and its like um sil yknow why dont you kind of like sil 
go past the outside and go inside because yknow sil um my wife was saying 
the other day she says uh well im getting wrinkles and im sil im thinning 
on top and sil and i go sil well laugh sil obviously youre not looking 
too close sil at sil me sil because i said yknow mother nature has a 
way of making your vision get a little worse sil as time goes by and 
i sil honestly feel sil its so that that sil tight butt sil tight skinned 
cutoffowwoman woman that you married who is not there anymore sil still kind of looks 
that way because iver sil yknow its sil yknow iver yeah sil right iver exactly 
yeah sil yknow and sil yknow its like uh unknown sil i unknown i sil 
honestly feel the older you get the more you sil kind of look at sil 
whats in there sil as opposed to sil yknow gosh thats sil just sil a 
cutoffhhundred four hundred dollar dress and a three hundred dollar hair do and sil yknow 
what does that mean yknow its like uh sil when were food for maggots laugh 
my feeling is uh sil vocnoise some people theyre gonna say sil gee she had 
a really big house sil and some other people are gonna go sil gosh she 
did work sil in this area for sil free and she volunteered at this and 
she did this and she did this and this sil and theyre gonna go sil 
oh sil yknow its like yknow what sil what sil what do you want at 
the very end yknow vocnoise so iver yeah sil you cutoffkcant sil you cant have 
a beer gut and a big ass sil and it means youre sil it means 
youre sloppy sil and lazy if you do but if a man does its like 
by god hes probably got some power behind him and its like sil duh hes 
probably just as lazy as sil anybody else its like yknow ive sil yknow i 
hate to see girls starve themselves to death sil yknow its like uh yknow sil 
there are certain times in your life where youre gonna be fat sil yknow sil 
yknow my my youngest daughter has a problem with that yknow sil shes sil i 
dont know why shes so insecure because she out of the four of us including 
her sister sil is like sil vocnoise sil yknow right at the top i mean

sil and some of them dont sil iver yeah its sil just like uh sil 
having alcohol around sil mean sil gambling is a lot like alcohol it can be

on it if youre that far gone sil so pretty much anything can be sil 
one of those factors laugh vocnoise iver sil well most people think its sil something 
they rely on like sil well the unknown sil money getting sil from the lottery 
to the people or sil lottery to schools vocnoise sil on that issue then yeah 
i sil i agree with sil the gambling thing sil yknow sil just as long

sil and fort hayes sil and sil well theyre unknown iver sil yeah ones a 
sil alternative school and the other ones just a sil regular trashy public school laugh 
iver sil well sil this is about giving opinions and sil my opinion about the 
columbus public school system really sil isnt good sil iver sil well because ive been 
in public schools all my life and i should be sil first to know that 
theres uh vocnoise sil lot of unknown sil favoritism sil yknow sil some sil some 
teachers will sil teach sil one but not teach the other sil iver sil well 
if iver yeah teach one person sil one thing sil and sil not teach the 
other person that sil kind of vocnoise sil let me see here sil give an 
example theres uh vocnoise sil theres a school that they showed on twenty twenty sil 
vocnoise sil somewhere out west sil i believe its nevada or somewhere vocnoise sil and 
they said that sil these uh sil teachers have the highest rating sil among sil 
many other teachers sil in the nation because of their sil actual sil sitting down 
and hands on sil critiquing these children vocnoise sil like uh vocnoise sil ex girlfriend 
of mine sil she was sil pretty much sil i wouldnt sil put her borderline 
illiterate sil but sil she didnt know how to read or write sil very well 
sil vocnoise sil and sil yknow her sil vocabularys limited and sil she didnt know 
how to unknown sil spell or sil know any sil bigger words sil so i 
tried to sit her down and sil yknow give her a little refresher and sil 
yknow its sil coming from sil a new jersey public school sil and sil doing 
a study then sil yknow sil couple these different sil places sil you never even 
hear of sil like sil i dont know cow pow kentucky or laugh sil wherever 
you want it sil yknow some small town would have sil this great sil teaching 
iver no sil and other towns sil just dont sil iver sil not sil really 
national system its already sil been put to national sil if they rate them sil 
state to state sil and city to city sil but sil on sil on the 
level of the sil actual needs of the student sil yknow you cant just put 
down sil yknow sil a book and say i want you to sil put five 
hundred words on this page why you like this sil or dislike this book sil 
i mean sil one person can do it sil and another one sil mean you 
could probably write about sil thousand words sil on a page right now about psychology 
sil because of your how many years do you have sil two sil three sil 
iver sil yeah vocnoise iver okay so sil youre unknown sil youre higher up there 
than sil i would be sil iver laugh iver sil whens your p h d 
come in sil uh sil iver sil all right iver thats about same time my 
friend got hers sil iver sil yeah she went down to western missouri sil iver 
sil yeah just had to leave me here sil weve been best friends for so 
many years laugh sil iver sil oh hell yeah look at you laughman sil iver 
sil you hoosier sil laugh sil yeah so uh sil things pretty much in columbus 
public schools yknow they dont sil they dont actually sit down with sil you sil 
they sil automatically assume that once you get to this level youre ready for this 
level and sil you go on sil iver sil well the p s a ts 
and the sil yknow sil just sil all those centralized sil scoring systems they have 
sil they cutoffththey sil they pretty much told me that sil yknow my scores sil 
when i was in sil what was it sil fifth grade vocnoise sil yeah fifth 
grade they said that i was sil i had a high i q sil and 
sil i could be doctor lawyer ya da ya ya da i dont iver sil 
trying to sil raise my hopes up about it but then sil they had this 
other kid sil who was actually really sil into sil veterinary medicine and flying helicopters 
and all that sil and he really did go on to uh sil study about 
that sil myself sil cook sil laugh sil but iver sil well they pretty much 
put sil by the test scores they dont sit you down like in sil private 
schools they do this sil they sit you down one to one sil just like 
we are sil and they spend probably sil yknow maybe vocnoise sil twenty thirty minutes 
a day sil actually getting to know the student sil vocnoise sil what the student 
still needs for the sil completion of that grade sil and sil once theyve figured 
that sil youre sil able to go there sil then sil up you go sil 
right up the ladder sil iver sil no its sil its kind of like um 
sil you go to a private school and you get there vocnoise maybe seven years 
old sil on up to vocnoise sil fifteen sixteen sil sil and at sixteen they 
can sil actually determine sil give you vocnoise sil a test and sil sit down 
with you and ask you about sil different things sil and sil sixteen sil fifteen 
sixteen year old could actually graduate from sil college sil yknow be sil yeah theyve 
sil cutoffshshowed vocnoise theyve showed that study already sil i mean i think its sil 
i think its amazing sil yeah sil i mean sil when i first heard about 
it i said uh some doogie howser shit sil yknow sil laugh sil but now 
its just sil yknow sil now its sil kind of reality yknow because i know 
sil pretty much sil a lot of skilled cutoffjjobs sil vocnoise vocnoise skilled trades sil 
i know how to cook sil pretty much know how to handle myself sil out 
in the sil wilderness sil laugh sil mean sil yknow go up on nature hikes 
and sil go fishing sil all that stuff just combines into one sil its all 
about being an individual sil and if those teachers cant study with that individual sil 
know what that individual wants sil young sil then sil older sil kids not gonna 
know what to do sil end up sil practicing law and not liking it sil 
going to all that school for it iver sil fort hayes sil iver yeah sil 
iver sil well i dont sil i dont think its really alternative sil iver sil 
its supposed to be a uh sil let me see sil school for sil art 
sil sil now they have different sil art classes and different speech sil and uh 
sil language classes sil different levels of science and vocnoise sil its kind of like 
a college campus sil iver sil its just like a miniature version of sil ohio 
state sil iver sil yeah you go to sil you go to class in one 
building sil and you go sil across the yard to another sil then you go 
to lunch and then you come across another sil and your locker and sil all 
that stuff its just like a mini campus sil iver noise sil not really the 
unknown vocnoise sil there were too many sil rules there laugh iver sil well sil 
you only had to be at your locker at a designated time sil iver sil 
and sil some of the teachers actually had the right to search your bags and 
vocnoise sil book bags i mean when it gets to that then sil vocnoise sil 
laugh vocnoise sil yeah theres sil theres been teachers there that actually pull students aside 
if they know theyre troublemakers and say well you cant come down here sil yknow

me some canned ravioli or sil laugh sil and you gave that kid a sil 
shotgun and he went out there and killed his laughownmeals laugh sil thats an interesting 
thing i just saw on the cutoffpappaper sil in the sil news week sil i 
was reading that sil and iver sil yeah and theres uh sil certain amount of 
uh sil gun laws sil that actually didnt sil get into sil until i saw 
that sil sil here in sil ohio sil its sil with a long gun or 
a hand gun sil you hafta be sil eighteen sil but sil other places like 
texas sil theres no sil minimum age sil on sil owning a sil yknow rifle 
or a hand gun or sil and youre looking like sil god man you pack 
sil uh just imagine this little six year old sil walking into the store packing 
sil laugh sil oh man sil iver sil yeah theyre gonna sil most likely raise 
it up to twenty one sil since all these uh sil the unknown sil kentucky 
and maryland sil colorado sil all those school shootings and sil vocnoise sil cant believe 
man sil i mean theres articles in there you would not even believe if you 
havent read them sil iver sil yeah talking about sil all these sil under age 
kids thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen sil even up to sil eighteen years old uh columbine 
shooting sil mean sil all those just sil relate sil in one category that sil 
yknow sil its getting out of control here bill do something laugh iver sil well 
sil think a little bit safer idea sil than uh sil eliminating guns sil because 
yknow theres always gonna be weapons out there sil instead of eliminating the problem sil 
yknow sil more centralize it sil make it a national law that you hafta be 
sil a certain age sil give a certain time period for your sil background checks 
and sil whatever else kind of record finding they need sil make sure youre sil 
yknow sil not gonna just go out and sil blow somebodys head off for no 
reason youre keeping it for sil yknow just sil either security reasons hunting reasons or 
practice sil yknow sil but sil iver yeah its sil the brady bill didnt really 
do it for sil america like they thought sil sil i mean yeah you wait 
five days big deal go out on sil twentieth avenue and sil pick one up 
in five minutes sil yknow laugh sil ive seen all kinds of people carry guns 
that shouldnt iver sil well its not sil its not how its sil put into 
effect sil the law its how its enforced sil yknow you dont just say well 
sil yknow little johnny stuck his finger in the pie and you cant do that 
anymore and sil yknow the more sil the more security youre gonna have over that 
pie the more hes gonna want it sil so sil and laughand going into the 
gun thing its pretty much sil nobodys winning game sil mean you make stricter laws 
sil youre gonna get sil yknow sil even more more people sil yknow sil struggling 
to sil get a gun and sil shoot somebodys head off vocnoise so um sil 
oh the school thing pretty much says itself metal detectors and sil police at the 
schools yknow its come down to that nowadays sil and um sil any gun you 
get from sil criminals sil yknow should sil i mean they sil already mailed them 
at sil buckeye steal but sil theres a little bit more you can sil do 
with those sil than burn them sil yknow sil you could set them up in 
uh sil some kind of sil top secret lab sil yknow sil out in d 
c somewhere sil the pentagon just sil have sil rooms and rooms stacked full of 
guns and sil i mean hell in case we hafta unknowngo sil do hafta go 
to war yknow just keep that little reserve iver laugh sil keep them out sil 
publics hands until the right time sil but sil i think that all sil all 
in all the sil solution would be sil get rid of the criminals sil well 
vocnoise sil how you gonna do that sil laugh sil you dont know somebodys a 
criminal until they do something for the first time sil iver sil yeah and a 
lot of thems been getting off the hook lately sil see this guy on uh 
sil sil hard copy sil he killed this sil womans husband sil because he was 
in love with her sil and sil they ended up sil letting him go because 
he was sil supposedly sil incapable of making his own decisions sil now sil i 
think that sil theres sil theres uh things in your brain that trigger ideas sil 
and if you have a sil wide sil yknow a wider version sil of sil 
what they cutoffccall vocnoise i dont know what they call it its in that sil 
magazine there sil what triggers the violence and sil violent thoughts sil people actually do 
think sil more about the violence sil when they commit it than sil the accidental 
sil yknow sil some of its mindless some of its not but sil everybody thinks 
laugh vocnoise iver sil yeah its like the uh sil sil the woman that useta 
live in the sil apartment where we lived before us sil see she sil had 
a husband sil she was married too for quite some time sil he got sil 
on sil ohios sil number one d u i list sil with sil eighteen d 
u is sil vocnoise sil man can you imagine sil how much money sil hes 
put into that sil i mean you think sil your first d u i offense 
would be about a thousand dollar fine and sil weekend in jail or something sil 
sil but eighteen of them sil and youre racking up all that money and all 
those legal bills and sil all that time sil vocnoise sil i think he is 
in jail now sil iver sil i think hes iver i think hes in prison 
sil and um sil he has sil no sil drivers license privileges sil for life

collectively together i know jason likes sydney a little bit better vocnoise but um vocnoise 
i dont know about boys names vocnoise sil and i just vocnoise well he said 
one like when i was about three months that we both really liked but that 
wasnt really names werent really what we were thinking about then iver neither one of

the morning and afternoon part and basically vocnoise yknow we talked about it and hesi 
just decided to go ahead and just take some time off hesand i dont know 
vocnoise i also went back to school then too sil so i figured id take 
that time off and i heswent hesim going to otterbein vocnoise to get my masters 
in education iver so were kinda doing that and then i figure im probably gonna 
vocnoise wait tables at night laugh and and finish going to school during the day 
so iver i got a job hesat at hyde park vocnoise so thatll vocnoise sil 
i mean vocnoise its just amazing because the moneys so good yknow you really cant

leaves my whole day free for classes and whatever vocnoise um vocnoise hyde park sil 
grill vocnoise its uh vocnoise its a restaurant its up in dublin sil so vocnoise 
i dont know i mean i cutoffddid hesi did that all through high school and 
college and after i cutoffggraduated actually after i graduated from high school i managed a 
restaurant for about a year and a half iver so i mean vocnoise its something 
hesim im comfortable with iver the hours cutoffwithwith vocnoise because jason works during the day 
too so it will probably work out pretty well for us iver just wanna get 
iver vocnoise iver yeah im vocnoise figuring vocnoise im vocnoise middle of january vocnoise is 
my guess ill go uh vocnoise school starts i think the fifth of january sil 
and then im gonna go that vocnoise i dont know well i cutoffthithink its weird 
because hesive had a job since i was fourteen iver and this is the first 
time in my whole life vocnoise that i havent been working and its just like 
vocnoise my mom and i go out to lunch and we go to breakfast unknown 
whatd you do today well noiselets see i went to breakfast with my mom and 
then amy and i went to lunch and then we vocnoise yknow and vocnoise hesi 
cutoffwewent actually i cutoffwwe sil we moved about cutoffffour three months ago so ive been 
kinda doing a lot of stuff at our place so thats nice i mean vocnoise 
had a lot of time to get everything wallpapered and painted extand and just do 
all those kinds of things but vocnoise its weird yknow because i dont have to 
get up in the morning and i feel guilty yknow he leaves at six thirty 
or seven and im going sil bye laugh laughhaveanicedayyknowandim vocnoise still sleeping which is vocnoise 
right now is really good because i have a hard time sleeping at night sil 
and after he leaves vocnoise its wonderful because i cutoffssleep can sleep in till about 
ten thirty and i feel a lot better iver yeah vocnoise well i figure right 
now i might as well take advantage of it iver vocnoise laugh laughnothingworkedout iver she 
has sil no she hasnt worked since vocnoise sil my sister megan was born and 
megan is twenty sil so sil vocnoise she but the thing is ive got another 
ive got a cutoffssister hesa sister my sister megan hesum extjoe is my brother hes 
fifteen and a half and then i have a sister vanessa whos twelve iver so 
i mean sil its not like there arent young kids still there i mean and 
she does stuff like vocnoise lots of things with school yknow she runs all the 
school candy sales and she does like lots of p t a she was p 
t a president vocnoise sil um sil she also likes to remodel houses so if 
theres a house that comes up shell buy it and fix it up and vocnoise 
and yknow she makes sil yknow twenty thousand dollars a year sil vocnoise on the 
side doing that she likes to do it and iver she figures well yknow that 
kind of makes up for me not working cutoffsso hesso iver umhum iver yeah its 
true and she likes it shes really good at it and sil hesand drives my 
cutoffsstepdad sil my stepdad laughcrazy laugh laughbecause because shell always be like vocnoise hey pete 
can you come over and put these cabinets laughinyknow he says i dont wanna do 
laughanythingelse sil but um iver she no she cutoffshshe iver extyeah shes kinda the cutoffd 
well she does all the painting and wallpapering and like all that kind of stuff 
but as far as the carpentry work we have sil vocnoise sil um sil this 
one guy thats been doing stuff for our house for a long time or iver 
shell make sil shell make pete go over and do it laugh laughnotlikehehasalotofchoice laugh no 
iver vocnoise iver um iver usually clintonville my mom vocnoise she um sil she doesnt 
shes not a big fan of driving vocnoise she doesnt really drive very much which 
is good ive ridden in a car with her one time and vocnoise and sil 
it just she just would prefer not to and heswe thats okay with us because 
shes shes got a drivers license for i d and those types of things but 
vocnoise sil for the most part so she kinda stays like clintonville area iver which 
is hesum sil which is actually a good place for her because a lot of 
those houses like right around the park of roses vocnoise and those noisetypes of things 
you can get some that are vocnoise older that need vocnoise hesthat need a lot 
of work but thats a pretty high demand area iver so sil that works out 
pretty well iver umhum iver yeah vocnoise sil yeah so thats pretty much what she 
likes to do iver yeah sil it is its nice sil it works out well 
iver my mom iver yeah shes laughalready laugh i didnt think shed have it any 
other way iver laugh well the thing hesi mean i know when my mom vocnoise 
my mom has a friend that adopted iver a baby sil um a biracial baby 
which cutoffwworked sil worked out well he is cutoffjijust just is the sweetest kid in 
the whole world vocnoise and hesuh sil um sil and my moms friend colin is 
a teacher and she watched jessie for vocnoise a good three year during the cutoffdaday 
i mean oh colin paid her obviously vocnoise but vocnoise i mean and she really 
she really enjoyed that yknow something that she could do at home yknow she wanted 
to go out and run errands she could take jessie with her iver yknow vocnoise 
noise vocnoise and that was cutoffha and that worked out well vocnoise but i think 
too like with my school schedule yknow if im just in class vocnoise maybe vocnoise 
yknow three four days a week vocnoise and then the rest the time in the 
evening jason will be there so its not like im relying on her vocnoise every 
single day cutoffaall vocnoise all the time to do that and i really wouldnt wanna 
put my child in daycare iver that would just be too scary for me iver 
really iver extum iver vocnoise iver laugh howd you do this to laughme laugh iver 
umhum iver right iver right vocnoise iver does it iver laugh iver em vocnoise aw 
thats nice vocnoise yeah im sure vocnoise iver right iver i think sometimes you theres 
a tradeoff between vocnoise time and money and you just have to look at it 
and say which is really more important iver absolutely iver umhum iver vocnoise i know 
that they changed it i know that it used to just be one day i 
guess because of the healthcare vocnoise something like that hesi hesi i feel like vocnoise 
sil a day and a half certainly would be long enough for me i mean 
unless theres some type of complications hesi vocnoise vocnoise i would be laughperfectlyreadytogohome vocnoise vocnoise 
yknow cutoffunleunless unless theres something extra that they could do for me there iver and 
hesand then i would expect that if there was a problem that they would make 
sure cutoffthathat that they kept me there but i think a day and a half 
is perfectly reasonable vocnoise i mean i hesdont sil i dont cutoffnknow sil i dont 
know ive never done this laughbeforeso i cant really say vocnoise but i mean vocnoise 
my feeling is vocnoise sil the least laughamountoftime i have to be in the hospital 
laughthehappierimgonnabe iver right vocnoise iver yeah thats true well we cutoffwenwent o s us and 
theyve got a nice facility i mean they have uh vocnoise uh cutoffd uh cutoffwv 
sil like a labor and delivery room its got like vocnoise its weird though because 
when you go they show you they they talk about all this whirlpool bath thing 
a room with it i dont know if youve heard those commercials or not vocnoise 
sil but cutofftheretheres vocnoise sil theres only one room thats like that iver and its 
sil interesting that they sil advertise that when you go there though vocnoise if you 
get that room thats what you get iver if not you just get the cutoffreregular 
vocnoise the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff vocnoise but 
its sil interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like vocnoise 
theres this huge place and youre gonna get that no matter extwhat and this and 
that vocnoise but when you actually go and look around it kind of vocnoise iver 
little different vocnoise iver vocnoise iver cutoffitit iver yeah its well basically its like a 
vocnoise sil vocnoise its about the size of a errorssmall very small hotel room and 
then its got a separate bathroom with like a big bathtub vocnoise and theres like 
hesa they there like oh its aroma therapy which is a little box on the 
wall about this big that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it vocnoise 
but sil i mean theres enough room where people can come and sit down theres 
like a fold out vocnoise couch bed for whoevers in there with you and then 
theyve got the baby vocnoise they keep the baby right there in the room with 
you after its born iver which i think is kinda nice vocnoise so vocnoise i 
cutoffmeamean hesit looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable vocnoise i mean my biggest thing 
is i just wanna have a room to all myself yknow i dont wanna go 
some place where im gonna laughhave to like deal with laughsomebodyelseinthere vocnoise so i mean 
it looks sil it looks nice but vocnoise i would be more comfortable at home 
i think once i go home iver vocnoise yeah iver vocnoise well i figure vocnoise 
therell be plenty of cutoffpepeople i told my mom i just want green jello you 
laughjust laugh laughshesgonnamakemesnacks laugh oh iver vocnoise i dont know it just sounds like it 
would be something that i would have to have its just necessary laugh iver oh 
iver vocnoise right vocnoise iver laugh iver vocnoise oh iver really iver vocnoise iver to 
the other side iver laugh iver im unknown iver no thats interesting though because i 
think vocnoise sil i think hesthat hesum that my whole hesi i mean i always 
still cutofffuhfeel i still feel like im extjust iver yknow im just one of the 
kids hi mom yknow vocnoise yknow hesand hesand i guess its true and ive always 
wondered vocnoise yknow i turned eighteen and i thought vocnoise sil well shouldnt i feel 
like an adult now vocnoise yknow i was twenty one shouldnt i start to feel 
like this responsible twenty five shouldnt i be an adult vocnoise yknow and i wonder 
vocnoise sil at what point do you really feel like youre vocnoise sil you are 
on that other side or youre one of the grown up people instead of one 
of the little noisepeople and maybe vocnoise sil maybe thats maybe thats one i mean 
vocnoise iver vocnoise iver yeah laughidontitis laugh well thats fair maybe thats true too i 
mean i dont feel laugh vocnoise because you know when youre younger you think oh 
my god twenty seven vocnoise thats so old you must be yknow and now that 
youre here youre like guys i cutoffzfeel sil i feel fine i dont feel laughlike 
laugh laughright laugh little more responsible but other than laughthat vocnoise iver really vocnoise iver 
umhum iver umhum iver huh vocnoise i have to wait i guess a couple weeks 
ill be laughhavingtotellyou iver umhum sil umhum iver vocnoise right vocnoise vocnoise iver well the 
thing is in lamaze they show you those cutofftatapes im sure you guys took those 
classes vocnoise theyre horrible they take seventeen hours of labor they put it into six 
minutes and you think vocnoise oh my extgod im gonna extdie yknow these women are 
like i just want to die laughyouknowandyourelike why are you showing me cutoffthithis vocnoise iver 
i said hesi didnt want to see that yknow i would much rather just vocnoise 
have my own opinion of what its gonna be like yknow and go by vocnoise 
sil what other people said sil my mom never had an epidural jasons mom never 
had an cutoffepepidural sil yknow and that looks worse to me did you see that 
vocnoise sil it takes twenty minutes they thread this thing this needle in your back 
they put this vocnoise sil that sounds worse to me than even vocnoise having a 
baby laughijustcanti cutoffsaisaid sil i dont want anything in my back laugh laughso vocnoise sil 
i guess its true you just have to wait and see once you get there 
sil what happens iver see thats great though iver was it hard iver really iver 
extoh iver hmm iver right vocnoise iver right iver uhhum iver vocnoise really see we 
almost think that that would be better but when you put it like that it 
cutoffcercertainly certainly iver vocnoise iver umhum iver laugh laughyeah iver yeah thats true thats a 
pretty good analogy iver umhum iver hm iver vocnoise something to think about vocnoise iver 
laugh iver laugh iver vocnoise oh the cutoffvvideo it was the cutoffvidevideo the cutoffvvideo the 
video tapes that i didnt like vocnoise it wasnt the class that was cutoffski the 
class was kinda goofy vocnoise but um sil it was that and watching the cesareans 
which i just vocnoise sil im not a vocnoise iver vocnoise sil oh yeah they 
showed they cut open the theyre pulling this baby out of this little hole of 
this ladies stomach and vocnoise sil i just vocnoise sil uh vocnoise i had a 
heart surgery when i was younger vocnoise sil and so ive had lots of needles 
and those types of things and i when it comes to needles hesand and that 
kinda stuff vocnoise im just kind of squeamish about it sil yknow so that stuff 
i just noise sil i just dont want to see it vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah 
i mean its not sil i mean it was a vocnoise really long time ago 
sil everythings fine vocnoise sil but i guess sil for me i just vocnoise sil 
hesit hesit sil i dont know its just its just a little more a little 
more than i wanted to see vocnoise but the classes i think were helpful vocnoise 
sil but um vocnoise whatd you ask me iver oh laugh iver yeah i think 
sil i think theyll be very helpful hesum sil i was going to o s 
u for vocnoise sil um sil to deliver the baby so i decided to take 
the classes there vocnoise sil and basically vocnoise sil my mom had reminded me over 
and over again sarah you need to schedule cutofferyour lamaze classes so i called o 
s u and vocnoise sil and i scheduled them iver umhum iver vocnoise iver yeah 
jason and and i and i went together iver and basically they were three weeks 
long they were about vocnoise sil four and a half hours sil the first one 
was sil really long vocnoise sil yknow jason was vocnoise hes i cant take this 
laugh last night wasnt so bad though i mean the first one was a lot 
of vocnoise sil lot of sil information classroom kind of stuff but vocnoise he did 
real well he was much hesuh hes just a cutoffsweetsweetheart hes just wonderful he was 
much more interactive hesthen than a lot of the other guys were just kinda vocnoise 
sil yknow they would sit there and they werent breathing and they were kinda rolling 
their eyes and i just think god you bunch of bums yknow its gonna come 
down to it yknow and vocnoise sil and youre gonna be so awful and hes 
just sil real supportive and vocnoise sil and just vocnoise hes just terrific laughso laugh 
laughitmakesit does vocnoise sil it makes it better vocnoise iver vocnoise iver umhum iver vocnoise 
iver yep vocnoise iver vocnoise laugh iver laugh sil laughyouredoingfine laugh iver laugh iver um 
vocnoise sil the parenting stuff they gave us a video to watch at home which 
was things like vocnoise sil how to diaper your extbaby extum sil a thing about 
whether you should leave them vocnoise sil crying in their in their bassinet or crib 
which of course sil hesi think is horrible and i think its good that theyve 
come out with all these new studies that tell people dont do that vocnoise sil 
um sil vocnoise lets see what else was there vocnoise feeding your cutoffbabybaby i mean 
it just iver that kind of stuff vocnoise so it was mostly cutoffth like vocnoise 
sil what we would do is we would talk about vocnoise wed talk about like 
extmedication like as far as while youre in labor iver uh breast feeding vocnoise there 
was a lot of that vocnoise i could tell these poor guys are like uh 
vocnoise laughcanwenottalkaboutthis yknow they were all kind of uncomfortable vocnoise sil um iver laugh iver 
and then vocnoise like lets see cutoffw sil a lot of it was hesi mean 
vocnoise most of it was vocnoise sil was cutoffyyknow like vocnoise pre extlabor and then 
there was the breathing that we did at the end but other than the video 
vocnoise sil it was mostly like labor related iver they tie it with vocnoise it 
was all very pro breast cutofffeefeed you could tell you could really tell that they 
had an opinion about this vocnoise sil um vocnoise we talked about positives and negatives 
of breast feeding things about vocnoise um cutoffhehe like the immune cutoffsystesystem some of that 
stuff i already knew vocnoise iver they had this thing about vocnoise sil um sil 
vocnoise the nurse said that there have been studies done where babies that have been 
breast fed have higher i qs iver which vocnoise i noise sil vocnoise she said 
that and i said vocnoise iver are you extsure hesi iver i was iver vocnoise 
right iver and thats the way i felt about it hesnot im not saying that 
thats not a possibility but iver sil for someone to actually state sil in a 
class vocnoise sil if you breast feed your baby theyre gonna have a higher i 
q than if you dont vocnoise sil i hesthought vocnoise iver umhum the bonding iver 
or iver breast feeding iver vocnoise right and i think that yknow i think that 
its just because yknow hesyou sil do so because i know ive done studies and 
i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way vocnoise 
and i think a lot of these people just vocnoise yknow they hessay vocnoise the 
nurse says something you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kinda 
strange but i mean vocnoise i think theres a lot of things that are probably 
positive enough about it that it vocnoise i would want to do it for vocnoise 
for a while as long as i could iver but vocnoise i dont know vocnoise 
iver really iver laugh vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise really iver really vocnoise iver huh 
iver thats different iver umhum iver hm iver vocnoise iver shes okay right iver laughohno 
sil vocnoise iver laughwow iver well sure iver laughsure laugh vocnoise iver hm iver vocnoise 
laugh vocnoise iver yeah iver really iver huh iver vocnoise yeah cutoffthethat we didnt really 
get vocnoise the the video tape they gave us was half infomercials vocnoise sil and 
then laugh laughthingslike vocnoise sil things like how to clean the umbilical cutoffchorchord i mean 
vocnoise stuff like that but youre cutoffb cutoffyouyoure sil as far as actual parenting things 
on it there was really nothing vocnoise iver even in the package of information iver 
they gave us iver vocnoise i think it would probably hesi i think it would 
be certainly interesting sil for people to read i think theres enough other resources out 
there if somebodys interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that 
vocnoise um sil i know hesfor for me vocnoise just because vocnoise i have so 
many younger brothers and sisters extand extand vocnoise sil my laughfamilyand everything i know how 
vocnoise sil ive got hessome some sil hessome vocnoise cutoffpretpretty vocnoise cutoffpretpretty what i feel 
are pretty good opinions about vocnoise sil how to handle different things and i know 
that my mom vocnoise always consults me yknow like vocnoise sil my sister vocnoise yknow 
she got her the d in french which vanessa is just vocnoise shes vocnoise this 
girl is almost creepy shes so bright sil i mean she extreally is vocnoise sil 
thing is one of those things were she just doesnt turn in her stuff sil 
yknow and if vocnoise shes twelve iver extand sil it sil extits sil cutoffyyknow yknow 
my mom yknow she always unknowntellspeoplewhatshouldwe yknow what do you think i should do about 
this and we always talk about different things vocnoise so i think vocnoise sil i 
think its kinda neat that ive been involved in a lot of vocnoise a lot 
of the other kids sil that way iver umhum iver vocnoise i dont know i 
think you just kinda deal with it when it gets here though iver but sil 
yknow i think one of the things that you see people do a lot hesthat 
really bothers me is that whole thing about vocnoise iver vocnoise i think you cutoffhahave 
just have to treat children like theyre extjust vocnoise sil cutoffiit vocnoise just you have 
to respect them and you have to not not talk down to them and and 
that whole thing about vocnoise sil yknow why cant i do this well because i 
told you so iver yknow what laughkindofananswer is that sil even if your answer is 
vocnoise i dont know why you cant do it it just makes me uncomfortable vocnoise 
yknow thats a extlot more fair than because im the boss of you or something 
like that and i think if you respect your kids vocnoise and and just kinda 
set boundaries with them vocnoise yknow kinda try to be vocnoise i dont know thats 
the way vocnoise vocnoise thats the way my familys always been and it always seems 
to work really well for us iver no yeah laughbecauseitchanges laugh vocnoise iver laugh vocnoise 
laugh laughokay laugh laughyeahreally laugh sil aw iver hum vocnoise is it hard to keep 
up with her vocnoise vocnoise iver umhum iver wow iver right iver laugh vocnoise look 
at her extshes so terrific laugh laughwatchhergo laugh iver vocnoise iver umhum iver umhum iver 
if yup we stay here sil cutoffprobabprabaly probably iver mmhmm sil i went to private 
schools for hesa long time iver hmm iver vocnoise i dont think that i would 
have them go to any laugh i learned things like vocnoise how to speak french 
how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party vocnoise that 
kind of stuff sil was a lot more laughfocusedthan vocnoise i mean i didnt even 
i dont think anybody even taught me how to write in cursive other than my 
parents vocnoise so i mean it was vocnoise hesit it was interesting i mean it 
was a lot more cultural kind of cutoffs vocnoise kinds of things you do a 
lot of vocnoise things with nature and and that kind of cutoffsstuff vocnoise unknown was 
sil the seventies too so i mean you laughhavetolookatthetime what were talking about vocnoise but 
sil ive hesuh i feel like vocnoise i dont see why hesi i wouldnt send 
them to public schools iver i mean hesi hesuh obviously thats a long ways off 
vocnoise um sil hesi hesi i guess i imagine i would be teaching in laughpublicschoolsohopefullyicouldtrytogetthemwhereiwasbut 
vocnoise but hesi sil i dont know i mean maybe vocnoise i dont is that 
hesi i dont even know if cutofft is dublin really better laughthan vocnoise than vocnoise 
columbus public or iver i think theyve got more money vocnoise i dont know if 
that necessarily makes them a better school vocnoise um vocnoise i think a lot of 
it is sil is is really what hesyou vocnoise vocnoise heswhat hesuh sil as far 
hesas as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and 
what they want to get out of it vocnoise yknow hesmy my family my brothers 
and sisters they all went to public schools and vocnoise and they took advanced vocnoise 
a p classes hesand and they worked real hard and vocnoise and theyve got i 
think that they have options iver that you really extcan get a lot out of 
it if thats something you want to do vocnoise and i think as long as 
youre involved with the school iver makes and just keep an eye on whats going 
on iver then youre really gonna get out of it what you need to iver 
umhum iver really iver umhum iver yeah vocnoise both sil my whole family all graduated 
megan was vocnoise first in her class joes ranked first my brother philips cutoffrarank i 
uh was laughnothowever laugh vocnoise laughyknowbut theyre all theyre all straight four cutoffporpoint iver thats 
laughright laugh straight four point o sil kids but vocnoise its true yknow and and 
they really vocnoise my mom really has cutoffworkworked vocnoise worked with them to make sure 
that vocnoise that they get into some programs that they need and theyre some things 
now i think that theyre developing that they didnt have before iver some different types 
of of courses and those types of things so iver umhum iver laugh iver laugh 
iver yeah sil yeah iver vocnoise iver umhum iver well um vocnoise sil my family 
vocnoise hes so funny because my parents are so you would never put them together 
now yknow hesuh hesit back then vocnoise yknow my hesmy well you saw my cutoffmomom 
hesoh no you didnt see her hesoh you laughdid vocnoise shes cute shes got a 
little hair cut shes all like vocnoise vocnoise but um iver she is shes wonderful 
but cutoffyyou cutoffbubut back then they were there was the sixties and they were hippies 
and vocnoise yknow my moms got long jet black hair and theyre cutoffwwearing vocnoise wearing 
their army outfits and theyre vocnoise whatever yknow everybodys got bellbottoms and my dads got 
long hair down to here vocnoise and everything so they lived like seventeenth avenue for 
a while vocnoise and we lived um sil like i said on summit sil until 
i was about three years extold vocnoise and then they split up for a little 
bit and got back together vocnoise and my mom and i lived some place on 
campus in just a little one room apartment it was just she and i and 
i would go see my dad on the weekends vocnoise which heswas vocnoise which was 
sil which vocnoise great for me i mean cutoffeveryboeverybody sil vocnoise my dad and i 
would do fun extstuff my mom and i would do fun stuff and it vocnoise 
and extand sil i vocnoise cutoffdondont i never remember it being negative iver vocnoise i 
extremember it being vocnoise its a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset 
about the fact that they werent together vocnoise because they all vocnoise both gave me 
a lot of attention vocnoise but um vocnoise extabout vocnoise i think i extwas maybe 
five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village iver and we stayed 
there for a while and then vocnoise sil she met my step extdad vocnoise sil 
when i was about vocnoise like six years old i think and then they moved 
up vocnoise uh to clintonville sil about when i was about eight sil now my 
dad lives up in clintonville too sil so iver yeah i mean i guess so 
i mean i always spent the weekends with my dad and i spent the week 
with them iver so and it was sil it was neat though because pete was 
my mom was twenty nine and pete was eighteen vocnoise and so pete was just 
laughlikesomekid who liked to play yknow wed go hesand fly kites hesand and do all 
this fun stuff and vocnoise sil and the thing that was always cool about my 
mom is cutoffthatha cutoffuhi it was somebody that sil wasnt real nice to extme or 
that i didnt really like sil she wouldnt have anything to do with them i 
mean the whole thing was yknow if i approve of this person iver then then 
that was always her main focus iver so that was real nice and i was 
her maid of honor when they got laughmarrieditwasjustitwaswellofcourseaboutthisbigbut iver but she always she always put 
me first and i think that that made it vocnoise a lot more positive for 
me vocnoise iver umhum sil iver oh yeah sil i would say sil so sil 
iver oh yeah iver umhum sil well i had to drive her down here last 
time so i didnt want to come back laughididntwanttocomeback if she has to come back 
i might as well go with her vocnoise im just kidding we went to get 
something to eat i dropped her off sil and she took the bus home sil 
exthum were talking about unknown iver umhum iver umhum iver vocnoise sil um vocnoise i 
think that vocnoise vocnoise i dont think that divorce is a bad thing vocnoise i 
think that sil cutoffitits sil its vocnoise sil if youre married vocnoise and extyou sil 
realize that you get to a point where you and this other person vocnoise extare 
are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your 
family vocnoise that its better to just say vocnoise look this is not laughworking vocnoise 
we both deserve to be happy and we cutoffdedeserve hesand hesand vocnoise and vocnoise go 
your own laughseparate ways vocnoise sil um vocnoise i think that vocnoise hesi sil i 
think for me personally sil i would certainly sil i would certainly try very hard 
to be in a situation where i wouldnt vocnoise end up getting divorced vocnoise just 
because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as like 
coordinating laughthings and i know that sounds kinda petty vocnoise but just vocnoise um vocnoise 
hesbut sil hesi sil hesi hesi sil i mean i dont think its i dont 
think its bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously 
vocnoise to continue to hesmake a relationship work that you should but my parents are 
very different iver yknow theres things about hesthe vocnoise my dad that vocnoise and i 
wouldnt want to live with sil laugh vocnoise uh hes great and hes wonderful to 
me i mean vocnoise my dad is really wonderful to me vocnoise but sil i 
mean things like vocnoise like when my mom had me heshe he didnt pick her 
up from the hospital sil i mean its that kind of stuff that you think 
what the hell were you thinking iver yknow vocnoise like i said hes great to 
me and and everything vocnoise but i wouldnt sil i wouldnt want to be married 
to him iver laughyknowicertainly wouldnt and would i expect my mom to stay with sil 
with that in that kind of a situation vocnoise no way i would want her 
to be happy vocnoise and i would want my dad to be happy also vocnoise 
so ultimately for that situation hesi think it was much better vocnoise um vocnoise they 
got married kind of young too yknow and i think that vocnoise i think that 
maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be cutoffmmore a little bit more 
careful sil vocnoise i know that vocnoise that now its a lot different than it 
used to be vocnoise people would get married and hesuh theyd just be expected to 
stay together and theres a lot of people that have been married vocnoise for a 
really long time and theyre miserable vocnoise iver yknow hesand vocnoise whats the point of 
staying married and being miserable i think its better to get a divorce than iver 
than to do that vocnoise iver see iver i dont agree with that at all 
vocnoise i think if your parents are unhappy together sil only thing thats gonna happen 
is its gonna trickle down and youre gonna have to listen to them being miserable 
vocnoise hesand and i think its much more positive to have two families vocnoise that 
are happy than one family thats miserable and they fight and then you feel like 
its your yknow people say its a my fault because this happened vocnoise yknow sil 
and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was 
younger vocnoise then hesi sil i cant imagine being a teenager sil and having my 
parents split up i think that that would be sil probably very difficult vocnoise um 
sil so i dont cutoffneknow thats a totally different perspective hesjust to look at it 
from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger iver laughnothats 
not what i mean vocnoise no i hesdont i dont mean it that way but 
i just mean vocnoise i think erroritits i think its better that if people are 
cutoffggetting hesare get to a point where they cant work it out i mean i 
think that vocnoise that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and 
those types of things and vocnoise and maybe there is some way to work it 
out iver but i mean if you get to the point heswhere you where there 
isnt then you just have to vocnoise i dont know i think you have to 
be in the situation in my situation i think for my parents vocnoise its better 
that they split up because theyre both very happy now vocnoise iver mm iver umhum 
sil umhum but i dont know if thats vocnoise i think that the divorce rate 
has gone up because its more socially acceptable im sure theres plenty of people twenty 
years ago that would have loved to have laughgottenadivorce vocnoise had that been an option 
vocnoise um sil hesi i think it just hesi think a lot of it is 
just depends on the way you handle it sil yknow how you vocnoise how you 
handle it after after the hesthe divorce is final i mean not vocnoise sil vocnoise 
sil do you see cutoffwhawhat does that make any sense at all vocnoise iver yeah 
iver yeah i mean hesi vocnoise it is hesits hesits hesits vocnoise vocnoise its a 
touch sil i think its hesi think its tough and i think its really an 
individual basis sil but i wouldnt sil i would say that theres a lot of 
vocnoise sil other things that are vocnoise cutoffththat that would contribute more to hesany hessocietal 
problems than divorce i really dont think that that would be the main iver because 
sil vocnoise um vocnoise i think the fact that things like cutoffih responsibility maybe a 
long time ago vocnoise people stayed vocnoise married because they felt like they had a 
responsibility to take care of hesof vocnoise their family i mean and you can be 
divorced and still take laughcare of your family vocnoise instead of vocnoise sil uh yknow 
cutoffm sil things as far as people getting pregnant and hesand then this person goes 
off hesand and leaves and youve got a lot of unmarried vocnoise single women that 
are all by themselves and vocnoise and vocnoise its just its more socially acceptable to 
sil to be able to do these things now then i think it was a 
long time ago i mean vocnoise peoples families wouldnt would never stand for something like 
that theyd say look you need to take care of this you need to deal 
with this and now its just vocnoise sil its kind of normal and everybody just 
kinda goes along with it iver vocnoise iver hum vocnoise iver yeah iver laugh iver 
see cutoffiit well if it doesnt if it doesnt work than i can vocnoise sil 
well thats what my best friend amy said ill get married and hell if it 
doesnt work ill just get divorced sil vocnoise laughi vocnoise laughthatsagreatattitudetohaveamy vocnoise but i mean 
vocnoise iver laugh laughyeahreally vocnoise i dont know i mean hesi guess for me hesi 
sil i just vocnoise sil i just think jason and i get along so well 
vocnoise sil yknow and cutoffwweve and weve been together for about two years and vocnoise 
i hesmean vocnoise hesi vocnoise i dont know i just hesi do i just hesi 
just really like him i dont laughknowifillfeelthatwayin vocnoise in ten years from now but it 
certainly vocnoise theres a lot of things hesthat that our families are very similar i 
mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about vocnoise sil about 
different things extand hesand we communicate very well and i think those are a lot 
of things you have to look at vocnoise from the beginning i know that i 
was in a relationship for about five years before i met him vocnoise sil and 
um sil vocnoise sil vocnoise his name was jason too but cutoffhhe vocnoise heshe vocnoise 
he drank a lot sil iver great guy vocnoise but he sure liked to get 
drunk sil yknow vocnoise and the problem was he would turn into such a jerk 
iver yknow and i just cutoffthoughthought hesit vocnoise sil i just dont sil i just 
dont like this is not so is this something hesthat vocnoise sil when i look 
long term is this something that i wanna deal with for the rest of my 
life and i said no it just isnt vocnoise yknow and i think that you 
have to look cutoffaat vocnoise sil and see if youre compatible with somebody sil hesbefore 
vocnoise sil yknow people get into situations and they marry people that you hesjust youve 
sil from the outside you can look and you can think vocnoise are you nuts 
sil yknow that is never gonna laughworkyknow so i think that vocnoise sil you just 
kinda hafta take into consideration yknow are you compatible do you really feel like this 
is something thats gonna cutoffbebe thats gonna work and be positive sil yeah i dont 
sil i dont vocnoise sil vocnoise im not old laughenoughtoknowanythingyet vocnoise iver umhum iver vocnoise 
sil its a lot bigger sil iver um sil vocnoise sil the things that i 
notice that are different sil vocnoise sil vocnoise i guess cutoffaand i mean hesif you 
look like vocnoise cutoffaas as far as expansion obviously theres a lot of areas that 
that are developed now that didnt used to be iver extum sil hesi hesi certainly 
spent most of my time heswell sil in the areas that i grew up i 
mean i dont iver vocnoise i dont really go over to the east side very 
cutoffooften very often yknow sometimes wed go over yknow in highschool and drive and see 
if we could see a prostitute sil yknow or something like that vocnoise but sil 
um vocnoise i hesdont sil i dont know cutoffwhawhat sil as far as vocnoise i 
dont really keep up with statistics as far as the crime rate and those types 
of things i mean i dont know vocnoise if its the media laughuhthats unknown yknow 
cutoffkinkinda sil portrays as theres more than there used to be vocnoise um sil i 
know that when i was younger i was allowed to cutoffddo to do a lot 
more things vocnoise uh by myself like to to go places on the bus hesand 
and those types of things and vocnoise than my familys allowed to do now iver 
so i dont know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous vocnoise um but 
i think that comes with the cutoffbbigger with a bigger city when you get more 
people theres obviously gonna be cutoffwi some more problems sil um vocnoise and uh i 
mean thats hesreally thats really all that i know so its obviously a lot more 
build up its gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and iver and 
a lot more um vocnoise different suburbs so maybe its vocnoise its going and hesand 
becoming a little wealthier iver and iver i dont think its cutoffreallyreally i dont think 
its really affected me cutoffthathat i mean obviously theres more places to go shopping or 
to exteat or you theres more traffic laughlaughi dont particularly care much for vocnoise sil 
um sil but hesit hesi dont think it was ever such a small town where 
it was like everybody knew each other vocnoise hesit hesand it felt like a small 
community i mean i know in my own neighborhood vocnoise extits it was where hesyou 
you went to school with the people once at least once i went to highschool 
i went to public school iver um sil and you kinda knew everybody around the 
neighborhood but i think that thats still vocnoise thats still the same for the neighborhood 
that my family lives in sil um vocnoise so i dont cutoffthingthink hesi me personally 
other than vocnoise other than the fact that maybe theres a couple more things to 
do theres bigger more comfortable movie theaters and vocnoise and that kinda stuff hesit hasnt 
really iver affected me and i cant say that vocnoise iver that maybe if hesit 
if it would have stayed small extmaybe vocnoise maybe hesi could notice some kind of 
a difference laughthatwaybut vocnoise but hesi i never vocnoise hesi i havent noticed anything iver 
right iver vocnoise i can see that i yknow uh like i said for me 
i kind of hesa vocnoise i kinda stay where i am so its not that 
i really travel hesout into some of those other areas sil more vocnoise so i 
mean cutoffwwell it doesnt really affect me personally sil maybe thats extbad laughidontknowmaybeshouldi cutoffjjust feel 
guilty laughaboutthat but iver but iver umhum iver right iver right vocnoise right vocnoise i 
think theres uh you theyre so many small communities like even heso o s u 
is really a vocnoise sil obviously its own its own little community and then youve 
got vocnoise yknow dublin and theyve got their own parades and their own different things 
so i agree i mean i think that vocnoise that you there really is a 
lot of things to do in our own individual area that vocnoise i cant see 
somebody from dublin going over to vocnoise the west side hesto to do laughanything laugh 
vocnoise yknow what hesi i dont vocnoise and uh maybe also hesi i feel safer 
vocnoise where i live too and and thats something thats an issue for me i 
know when i vocnoise do travel down cleveland avenue it makes me it does it 
makes me nervous vocnoise so vocnoise i just kinda stay away from that vocnoise um 
iver laugh laughidontknow sil i dont wanna get shot iver umhum sil yeah iver umhum 
iver yeah iver vocnoise well its heskinda its kinda hard when youve got laughyour vocnoise 
your cutoffv limited choices here yknow some of it some of the issues i thought 
were kind of vocnoise important but when youre looking at the vocnoise sil mayorial candidates 
sil did you watch that debate iver oh was laughhorribleitwasahorrible vocnoise because you watch it 
and you think hesuh oh my god vocnoise iver i dont want either of these 
people iver i mean cutoffdoddorothy dorothy peters obviously been around for a really long time 
and i uh vocnoise i would tip im vocnoise my views are typically a little 
bit more democratic but im not too say that i certainly wouldnt vote vocnoise um 
vocnoise for the person that i thought would do the best job iver but when 
you look at coleman he sil cutoffthithinks sil thinks vocnoise there was cutoffaa sil point 
where they cutoffsaisaid they asked a yes or no question iver and neither one of 
these folks sil could hesanswer it yes sil or no and theyre going vocnoise just 
answer yes or no theyll tell you vocnoise well i think i stated my point 
very clearly when i was vocnoise no the answer is yes or is it was 
vocnoise it was um vocnoise healthcare extfor vocnoise living partners vocnoise um vocnoise its a 
simple question vocnoise yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it 
just vocnoise drives me nuts that vocnoise yknow and i know that that from a 
p r stand point you dont wanna vocnoise you dont wanna shun any people away 
that might vote for you because you feel like the vocnoise damn it sil yknow 
if youre running for office sil you should just sil just be up front iver 
just say how you feel iver yknow because i just think it looks so awful 
when you cant you cant even admit to what hesyou what youre opinion is iver 
yknow and hesand its just vocnoise i think that that happens so often there are 
too many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when youre talking circles 
around yourself vocnoise but you never say anything iver so thats sil thats frustrating for 
me when you look at both of the candidates and you think sil i dont 
want either one of these people there should be a none of the above vocnoise 
yknow if there was hesuh that option im sure a lot cutoffmomore iver umhum iver 
really yknow i agree i mean none of the above you go and i think 
a lot more people would certainly go out vocnoise they would vote for none of 
the above and they we can have some more candidates iver i think that would 
be perfect iver laugh iver vocnoise i think it would iver well i think its 
true hesyou hesyou dont vote because you think i dont want either one of these 
people what does it matter iver heshe who cares so yknow people just think vocnoise

money that you pay to park downtown is vocnoise sil outrageous vocnoise um vocnoise even

i worked on hesi worked on front street vocnoise and where i would come cutofffrofrom 
i live on bethel road which is vocnoise id take bethel to three fifteen vocnoise 
down sil through downtown and it would take me an hour and forty five minutes 
sil in the snow vocnoise to get down there and if i could vocnoise if 
i could jump on this rail system and it would take me fifteen minutes and 
i wouldnt have to pay fifty dollars a month for parking vocnoise heswhy why not

the the cutoffvviolence iver violence iver there well theres the whole thing about the police

cutofflawslawsuit the federal lawsuit against columbus iver well just chief cutoffjajackson of the thing about 
chief jackson sil i dont sil vocnoise hesuh hesuh hes hesnot i hes vocnoise iver 
im not real up on this i know that um sil vocnoise heshe hes done 
some things and hesi vocnoise iver i dont know hesi i cutoffknknow vocnoise i dont 
know if it was drugs or laughsomeiknow something ridiculous vocnoise that vocnoise that a lot 
of people and i think a lot of the vocnoise cutoffppolice the police force and 
a lot of other officials are vocnoise are pretty much in agreement that he should 
resign sil and he feels like sil like hes just not going to vocnoise sil 
and that we dont have any um vocnoise cutoffwwe that the mayor cant vocnoise nobody 
can actually make him resign that thats something he has to do on his own 
and that was one of the big things as far as vocnoise yknow dorothy was 
teater was saying im gonna make him do this which is something that she doesnt 
have any power to do vocnoise um sil hesthat hesand and about how vocnoise how 
they just continue to get raises and theyre and theyre not doing very much about 
it and vocnoise and less than fifty percent of the police force is actually in 
police cars and vocnoise and a lot people hesare are doing desk jobs and those 
types of things and hesi i guess a lot of people just arent very happy 
with the job hes been doing iver and he just says yknow i hesdont i 
cutoffdodont whether you like me or not i dont care vocnoise im gonna keep working 
vocnoise i dont know but i think it was something it was something real shady 
that he that he got into and i knew that vocnoise i dont know if 
it was sil vocnoise i think it was sil like sil vocnoise cocaine or cutoffsomesomething 
i dont something cutoffwa i dont sil i dont know i mean something that was 
pretty shady iver yeah and i dont know if its quite that laughbadbut laugh but 
it was certainly some things that hes been doing that arent arent approved of sil 
and im not real up on that sil so vocnoise iver isnt that extunbelievable its 
iver extamazing iver vocnoise thats almost worse though that its not even a surprise sil 
iver laugh iver laugh iver oh my god iver right iver umhum iver laugh iver 
umhum give us a job sure vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver is wrong with 
him iver yeah iver yknow i think a lot of times uh you yknow people 
arent real rational as far as as who they sil they go for iver vocnoise 
sil but i can certainly i can certainly see that sil and that cutoffmihme vocnoise 
i think that yknow lot of cutoffththe a lot of people feel like too oh 
hes hes hes one us yknow hes like hes like we are kind of thing 
sil vocnoise well michigan its a ten year mandatory jail time sentence if you get 
caught with any cocaine at all sil iver ten years no question about it thats 
it vocnoise sil youre in jail for ten years eighteen years old vocnoise if youve 
got anything on ten years noise thats it vocnoise yknow and you look at some 
of these other people or like these sports people and iver sil they get caught 
with that stuff or have cutoffihit sil and nothing happens and it just sets such 
a horrible example vocnoise sil that here youve got you know some regular some vocnoise 
sil vocnoise eighteen year old kid that does something really stupid noise and hes ten 
years in jail vocnoise and then youve got this other guy that does all these 
really stupid things and he can be elected well yknow and you just sil its 
just sil its so sil vocnoise its so wrong laugh sil vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah 
well iver i dont even know what to cutoffsihsay what a disgrace laugh laughitsjust embarrassing 
it really iver yeah iver i did sil i did iver vocnoise i mean i 
think hes done some positive things that whole thing about vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise 
sil cutoffehas cutoffehas as far as like your student loans and being able to get 
laughintosintoschool laugh which has helped me yknow vocnoise and i cutoffthithink yknow all this that 
cutoffaeas as far as some of the issues go vocnoise sil i think that that 
i feel pretty similar to the way he does vocnoise sil um some of his 
foreign policy things i think have gone pretty decently but i mean i think vocnoise 
sil i dont i dont know i mean it vocnoise sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil 
hesi vocnoise i dont know if if it really if you really sil it sil 
i feel like that theyre that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with 
really vocnoise yknow and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas 
but they dont vocnoise sil they dont ever really put anything into action they just 
kind of skate along sil yknow and i dont know if theres anything substantial i 
can say vocnoise sil and that was a wonderful thing that you did that i 
feel very affected by it vocnoise um vocnoise economys fine sil i mean so cutoffahits 
its not that hes vocnoise not that hes doing a horrible job but i dont 
really know how much hes actually doing vocnoise yknow and i think that unfortunately spend 
a lot of your time trying to get out of vocnoise out of personal sil 
issues that youve gotten yourself into and you cant really focus on anything thats thats 
positive that you wanna do for vocnoise for the country and i think sil i 
think its just too bad because i feel like sil vocnoise if i was president 
uh not that i wanna be president but vocnoise yknow youd have three or four 
things that youd think were very important youd youd vocnoise hire a lot of other 
people to take care of the other areas and people that were very competent that 
youd feel like theyd actually be able to accomplish some things vocnoise and youd really 
work to get some stuff done yknow and i dont know if its vocnoise sil 
if its just because vocnoise yknow you have to vocnoise get agreement from all the 
other all the sil everybody else in government before you can pass anything or or 
why vocnoise yknow why dont these things get taken care of i mean theres so 
many different issues that people wanna look at and unknown end up focusing on things 
like philip morris yknow vocnoise which is like the biggest thing in the whole world 
yknow and and theres so many other things that i think you could be looking 
at that are vocnoise sil that are important vocnoise i just vocnoise sil i dont 
know maybe i mean i dont sil i dont im not real up on everything 
thats been done but vocnoise sil vocnoise i guess it just kind of seems like 
i wish people would be a little bit more focused and you and you would 
be able to say vocnoise yknow this is what theres these three things that i 
think are really important that im really gonna work to make sure that they get 
taking care of and vocnoise and i dont sil i just think people kind of 
ladeeda it and say well this is vocnoise its like this yknow well well see 
what we can kind of do about it and then well vocnoise sil yknow iver 
right vocnoise iver yeah i mean but i mean vocnoise were not at a depression 
and vocnoise and the yknow the employment rate is fine and vocnoise healthcare is weve 
got some improvements there and like i said that vocnoise that student loan laugh unknownthisisbignotes 
yknow uh but i just vocnoise i mean so i wouldnt say hes done a 
a a horrible horrible job vocnoise but i mean i think that you just spend 
so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that weve 
wasted vocnoise but we could have spent that cutoffttime vocnoise money on something else yknow 
and you end up vocnoise sil vocnoise doing that iver yeah i usually dont vocnoise 
laugh not quite there laughyet vocnoise sil not really iver yeah sil yeah sil vocnoise 
iver iver i sil i dont i dont laugh iver really iver yeah vocnoise i 
havent i i really havent even havent even given it that much thought yet sil 
iver vocnoise sil once they start running those laughcampaigns laughyknow vocnoise then ill kind of 
kind of read up on it but i havent sil vocnoise not really sil iver 
okay iver thats fine iver vocnoise laugh laughno i think cutoffahi im sil im perfectly 
content vocnoise iver iver excludeonetwothreefourfive iver what kind iver mm hmm iver iver iver vocnoise 
ive been here all my life sil um sil i uh sil right now i 
dont mm do anything sil uh sil i had a sil head injury in ninety 
three sil where i got hit with a hockey puck in the sil head sil 
at a chill hockey game iver and uh sil thats when i lost my job 
after that and things got difficult vocnoise more and more difficult sil um sil was 
unable to work full time sil im doing some part time work right now vocnoise 
working with people with mental illness sil um sil but extits yknow the sil the 
thing im running into out there is that uh sil nobody wants to pay you 
to do anything laugh uh i dont understand that but uh sil and then the 
when they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out of you 
sil yknow they give you a pager a cell phone and they want to know 
where you are morning noon and night seven days a week and thats none of 
their business sil um sil so i vocnoise the frustrations with trying to find an 
adequate job and an adequate employer that understands my situation and sil and how i 
operate and will give me freedom to do sil what i can do sil i 
have a bachelor of arts in communications but its been more of a problem than 
its been a sil asset sil um sil interviewing for jobs vocnoise people that uh 
were doing the interviewing sil had just a high school education sil and uh sil 
theyre not gonna hire me sil when sil after a year id be their boss 
laugh sil um so a lot of that is out there sil uh regardless of 
what people say im not trying to be pessimistic or negative sil its just been 
my experience sil uh unfortunately sil um vocnoise i hope it gets better sil but 
uh sil like i said i havent been sil ever sil uh told that my 
degree sil matters sil by any employer sil uh contrary to what the news tells 
you and sil what people will tell you oh go get that college degree sil 
uh sil yknow uh sil people told me sil soon as i got out of 
college then i needed a masters sil and then sil they said and after you 
get your masters youll vocnoise definitely need your doctorate sil well yknow the people saying 
this are sil college people sil the college is a business sil uh vocnoise sil 
and it takes awhile to laughrealizethat vocnoise if you can get in and get that 
education on grant money and scholarships thats sil thats good but then sil even now 
sil being a person with a somewhat disability from a brain injury sil um i 
mean i dont even like to call it disability and sil i have sil uh 
different abilities now sil yknow same abilities i used to do sil but i have 
to do them a different way sil um just because my brain functions on a 
different level and i cant explain that sil to anybody and i shouldnt have to 
but im always forced to sil um sil but uh trying to find a job 
yknow sil uh sil resulting sil from this has been difficult and uh sil cutoffaand 
and thats uh yknow im not giving up hope or nothing like that im just 
trying to sil trying to cut through and see what i can do sil and 
uh sil yknow theres just ah sil um sil um its very limited out there 
sil yknow cutoffanand and your noiseeducation is sil is an asset but like i said 
even as a person uh sil now going through b v r sil um im 
discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelors sil in other words sil 
uh bureau of vocational rehabilitation sil which is government funded sil organization geared toward helping 
people with disabilities get back to work sil and um sil vocnoise because i already 
have a bachelors they wont pay for school sil now if i were stupid sil 
yknow if i just had a basic sil just got out of grade school sil 
and didnt even have my g e d sil boy theyd pay for my high 
school my college and everything sil yknow even living expenses sil yknow sil but sil 
because i have a bachelors sil nothing sil yknow iver her limited very limited iver 
so i mean its thats what im saying the sil uh i think its sil 
even american disabilities act talks about certain things about employers sil um and and with 
my lawsuit sil yknow with the uh sil the chill sil and yknow with all 
the sil public trials of high profile trials i think its cutoffaan education for everyone 
to know that the legal system sucks and does not work sil um is not 
fair sil its a rich mans person or a rich persons system sil judges are 
bought and paid for sil theyre elected sil um vocnoise theres a lot of crap 
there and errorinei learned all this not from sil just my experience but from people 
that i know that are attorneys sil that there are judges down there sil that 
take bribes sil and thats sil thats not right so you cant sil when youre 
dealing with that system sil justice comes at a price sil and you get as 
much justice as you can afford sil and during my lawsuit that was sil very 
evident sil yknow laws are made to protect sil people that are wealthy sil and 
that commit crimes sil and its not right its not fair but thats the way 
it is sil so um sil i didnt wanna go into law sil laugh sil 
didnt wanna go into paralegal i was looking into that and sil lady kept hounding 
me and telling me yknow well sil maybe you could get in it to make 
a difference im like why would i wanna make a difference if it kills me 
sil yknow because i know myself sil and i dont put up with crap sil 
yknow i see a liar i bring him out sil yknow sil and uh sil 
i was just brought up to be an honest person sil and um sil unfortunately 
theres a lot of people out there that sil yknow they sell out their ideals 
and their principles sil for forty thousand dollars a year sil and then they use 
their family or sil their situation financially excuse to sell those ideals out sil im 
not that kind of person sil and i wont ever be sil um sil so 
if that means that i stay sil monetarily poor for the rest of my life 
then so be it sil yknow i got a conscience sil and uh sil and 
people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there sil laughbutthats sil 
yknow thats basically where ive been sil yknow sil um ive lived here my whole 
life like i said i went to college i played baseball sil um sil due 
to injuries yknow knees and shoulder i sil just sil i was very vocnoise i 
was pro caliber sil yknow uh i played baseball with the sil with paul oneil 
and kent murker which are a couple of guys that vocnoise yknow did get signed 
laughprofessionally and are playing right now sil um sil so at least i can say 
i played sil against them sil and uh sil least with kent murker i can 
say i sil hit a home run sil off of him sil so sil that 
was a while ago but sil that was when he was young and very good 
sil laughand sil laughiwas sil i was three or four years older and still took 
him deep to center field so sil ill never forget that but uh sil vocnoise 
i earned that laugh so thats um sil vocnoise well um sil vocnoise sil well 
that uh yknow i i dont refer to it as an accident anymore sil yknow 
theyre sil um sil my whole life it changed ah sil in every sil facet 
sil um sil from it sil um sil yknow physically emotionally mentally and spiritually sil 
um used to be catholic i dont follow that way anymore sil and um sil 
yeah i follow more uh sil ah sil natural way sil of following god sil 
nothing uh sil new age i dont wanna say exactly what yknow just say that 
the people this land sil long time ago before anybody came over here with their 
bibles and crap sil um sil ramming jesus down peoples throat the people of this 
land had a way of worshipping god and thats the way i wanna sil thats 
the way i follow sil um sil so a lot of people say thats native 
laughamerican or say thats indian or whatever yknow i dont care what they wanna put 
on it but its sil its thats a natural way of following god its the 
way i put it yknow sil unknown worshipping that there and respecting the spirit that 
moves through all things sil all living things sil and uh sil so i went 
through all that all those changes and uh are still sil yknow coping with them 
and trying to find ways to cope with them to sil um sil to move 
forward in my life now what happened with the chill was yknow there was sil 
uh vocnoise i had a friend that worked for them so they didnt know that 
and um sil uh he told me that there was glass in the back sil 
room that they were supposed to install were supposed to have installed that was five 
feet higher sil three to five feet higher sil and um sil should have would 
have could have yknow if it was up i wouldnt have got hit sil i 
mean theres no two ways about it sil but sil if i didnt get hit 
i wouldnt be where i am vocnoise now sil spiritually so sil vocnoise sil i 
dont refute it as an accident sil and most of the spiritual leaders and people 
i talked to sil ah went through the catholic church because that was where i 
was raised and what i was raised and none of those people could provide me 
with any adequate things sil terms of counseling i know they tried sil i know 
they did the best that they could sil but um sil theres a lot of 
things that the catholic church wont like to admit that theyre wrong on sil and 
they are wrong sil um sil uh sil vocnoise theyll sit there and ask me 
to atone for my sins yet they wont atone for the sins of all the 
priests that are molesting children still to this day sil and they protect them sil 
and thats not right sil and im very sil very sil uh sil outspoken about 
that sil so rather than banging my head on the wall to people who wouldnt 
listen i just decided to leave the church sil i dont go there anymore the 
only time ive gone there was for sil my nephews baptism and my grandparents funeral 
sil and thats the only time youll find me in there sil yknow sil i 
went to a wedding sil too but its difficult sitting in there sil because of 
the way i follow now and uh sil and actually seeing things for what they 
are sil and its frustrating not being able to explain that to people but thats 
okay sil um sil with the lawsuit ah we had a private investigator that went 
in there and found all the information that showed that they sil had all that 
higher sil taller glass back there over a year sil so they tried to use 
the excuse their excuse was that they couldnt find the hardware sil to install it 
sil and uh given all the hardware stores that we have here and sil the 
ability to over night freight things uh sil if it was any kind of ah 
sil special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of 
the country sil theres no excuse sil vocnoise sil so basically sil yknow it came 
down to after sil it came to a legal battle sil which was ah i 
was not gonna back down sil they were um sil i was poor monetarily and 
they knew that sil so they were using the legal system to wear me down 
sil um sil the first uh at the date of filing i mean sil first 
of all it took sil i had a statute of limitations was two years sil 
uh i had an attorney in a law firm representing but they were dragging their 
feet sil vocnoise i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed 
with the chill sil yknow sil and that they were getting paid under the table 
to drag their feet sil even though i knew the guy so i just said 
well look im dissatisfied im gonna go find another attorney sil so give me my 
file sil see you sil and i went shopping around for a new attorney sil 
and it took me about sil seven sil before vocnoiseum sil vocnoise pardon me sil 
seven attorneys before i found one that was sil adequate in terms of sil knowledge 
of head injury and brain injury because his father was a neurosurgeon and uh sil 
he had experience and expertise in uh sil bringing up vocnoise the uh sil the 
differences uh sil and the realities of of a brain injury sil ah and the 
effects the lifelong effects yknow sil so after sil the two years we got in 
uh sil just under the two years sil so i mean sil hell that would 
be what it happened in ninety three so sil just under sil december ninety five 
sil uh sil the day the last day sil of ah sil the statute running 
out we filed sil so we got it filed sil once it was filed the 
judge ah scheduled a hearing sil and for whatever stupid reason sil um sil the 
soonest they could hear the case was one year from the date that we filed 
sil so sil you can see when you get extinto bed with yknow sil and 
involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multimillion dollar lawsuit sil or 
whatever sil yknow any kind of lawsuit uh sil the big boys get all the 
breaks sil so sil ah in my opinion the judge didnt wanna hear the case 
before then or maybe his docket was full but im saying sil yknow theres no 
prioritization in the legal system sil there are some things that uh should be addressed 
sil soon sil uh i shouldnt have to wait that long but sil so then 
sil came down to one week prior to the uh sil hearing sil and i 
got a letter from my attorney and he said that uh and also a phone 
call from the office saying that uh sil um sil that they uh sil were 
filing a continuance sil vocnoise which meant that uh sil the judge granted them an 
additional year sil of discovery sil um sil vocnoise whatever the law says sil yknow 
sil the judge says he has to back it up sil but sil so that 
postponed the trial for another year sil which pissed me off sil yknow sil but 
thats exactly what they were planning on sil yknow sil wearing me vocnoisedown like i 
said sil knowing that i dont have the money to sil throw in there and 
say hey sil yknow sil um sil but extthey know full well that we had 
all the evidence that we had too sil so sil ah sil that just postponed 
it for another year finally we got into uh sil coming in and then they 
ah sent a letter saying they wanted to sil meet sil uh for arbitration sil 
to see if they sil we could hammer out some kind of settlement sil couple 
months before the trial sil uh i was unaware of this common practice but yknow 
sil it was very sil iffy situation sil um juries here sil uh in columbus 
have been mm sil ultra conservative sil uh they feel that people for some reason 
or another sil that people that have been legitimately injured and their lives have been 
affected that they dont deserve money sil for whatever reason sil um sil and it 
unknownandi dont think its fair sil that they can sit back and be that conservative 
if it hasnt happened to them sil i dont think thats fair sil um sil 
because it does affect your entire cutofflaylife sil has sil otherwise id be full time 
employed sil id be gainfully employed making money and im not sil and thats sil 
thats not because of anything sil uh sil its by choices on my part but 
its sil its uh sil you know theres a lot that sil theres a lot 
there sil the betrayal that ive had to struggle with theres a lot there that 
sil um sil yknow i felt ive been betrayed sil by everybody that taught me 
sil i feel betrayed by the the government sil by the legal system sil by 
the politicians by all the people that have been put in charge sil to protect 
people sil to protect ideals sil to protect principles vocnoise throw it out the window 
for money sil and then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt sil 
um sil it got down to just sil ah dollars and cents sil bartering sil 
for what my life was worth sil and its sil the bidding started at a 
hundred twenty five thousand dollars sil i feel im worth more than that sil yknow 
vocnoise sil i feel like you cant put a value on a human life sil 
um sil yknow there were just subtle things that yknow my sil sense of errorssmell 
sil taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half sil ah 
sil just all the trauma that goes involved with it not just sil not just 
the physical trauma i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me 
because of my size because of my strength sil uh i wasnt killed sil yknow 
sil um sil vocnoise so the physical sil burden i was still dealing with a 
lot of the physical pain sil uh its gotten significantly less sil but sil uh 
the emotional pain sil was worse sil and is worse sil um having to sil 
have a sil yknow a lack of money now sil vocnoise sil means lack of 
socializing means lack of going and doing things sil um sil yknow vocnoise dont have 
any sil vocnoise lot of relationships dont have sil a girlfriend dont have a wife 
dont nothing like that ive got a dog sil a golden retriever sil sil vocnoise 
he was being real helpful sil yknow sil with the sil uh being a support 
vocnoise yknow my parents are very supportive but sil yknow it was just sickening that 
i when i sat down there and they sil just you know the bidding started 
at a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and sil actually they offered us twelve 
thousand dollars my sil attorney looked at him and said are you fucking nuts sil 
he said this guy had his head split open and sil it was your negligence 
sil so sil you know sil well well take that as an insult iver sil 
and dont insult us any more or well go to trial sil vocnoise sil um 
sil so my attorney jumped it back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand 
dollar vocnoise sil i couldnt take sitting there sil these guys going back and forth 
and what they thought i was worth sil vocnoise sil even the arbitrator was an 
asshole sil vocnoise sil um sil but uh sil thats the way that system works 
iver thats all they understand is money iver the lawyers the judges everybody sil that 
works in that system sil vocnoise sil i dont care who they are there isnt 
an honest one in it sil noise sil i dont care sil vocnoise sil there 
isnt an honest one in it they might think they are sil vocnoise sil but 
once you sil vocnoise sil expose yourself to corruption sil laugh sil vocnoise sil you 
take that in with you iver and sooner or later sil yknow all the people 
that have gotten into political offices and public service vocnoise i guarantee you they went 
in it with vocnoise the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference sil 
but sil vocnoise sil but sil once they get in there sil its such a 
bureaucracy iver its so corrupt sil they have two choices vocnoise to stay in it 
and try vocnoise or to succumb to all the things sil and vocnoise sil ninety 
percent of them as you can see what happens in washington sil vocnoise have succumbed 
sil vocnoise sil yknow sil theres a vocnoise i dont i dont hear any of 
them sil vocnoise raising hell about what really matters in this country sil iver yknow 
they all get uh side lined and side tracked by special private interests and thats 
sil thats the bottom line sil vocnoise and its sad but theres sil vocnoise so 
cutoffii i choose not to involve myself in that sil as vocnoise sil much as 
possible we ended up settling for iver vocnoise yknow bout seventy thousand dollars and uh 
vocnoise um sil it was just a hard decision to make yknow because i felt 
yknow sil a lot more shoulda come from that sil vocnoise sil i mean in 
cutoffororder vocnoise joking around yknow i saw that adam sandler movie big daddy he sil 
got his foot run over by a cab and there was a line in there 
sil vocnoise sil pardon me where he says uh sil vocnoise sil well i got 
my foot run over by a cab and that cab was huge and the jury 
decided that one night of pain in the hospital was worth two hundred thousand dollars 
iver iver and im like yknow what hospital was that yknow where sil cutoffwhwhat extwhat 
what extjury yknow sil vocnoise sil uh sil so a lot of the things you 
hear in movies and television about these multi million dollar lawsuits hesare sil hesis is 
a lie sil vocnoise um sil even the lady that sil i mean vocnoise sued 
cutoffffor sil mcdonalds for vocnoise sil spilling the coffee on herself because she put exther 
in her crotch with the lid off yknow uh sil vocnoise sil uh there ought 
to be a common sense clause in law suits yknow cutoffiit her own stupidity sil 
vocnoise sil uh and extthen you get the attorneys trying to argue that well mcdonalds 
sil coffee is hotter than every other sil coffee sil vocnoise iver its like vocnoise 
big deal sil yknow common sense its hot you dont put it in a sensitive 
area while youre driving to work vocnoise um vocnoise but she sued for ten million 
and the papers said she won ten million sil she didnt sil sil i mean 
after that ten million award was given by a jury vocnoise sil then the uh 
mcdonalds is allowed a vocnoise sil an appeal sil vocnoise sil at the end of 
a year so she doesnt see any money for a year sil vocnoise and thats 
if they dont appeal sil but ninety percent of these big corporations have the money 
behind them they have the lawyers behind them sil vocnoise sil so they can sue 
for an appeal iver uh poor people cant do that sil vocnoise sil um sil 
vocnoise sil extso after all is said and done with her case she was left 
with about a million dollars sil vocnoise and then out of that million the attorney 
in the firm got a third sil plus she had to pay off his expenses 
so sil vocnoise sil really she was probably left with only about three hundred thousand 
dollars sil vocnoise sil which if used wisely okay maybe she couldve sil vocnoise sil 
but it sounded to me like she didnt have a money problem anyway sil she 
was a corporate person sil vocnoise sil um but a very stupid person sil vocnoise 
sil um sil so i mean thats basically my my sil battle with the legal 
system i vocnoise sil yknow ive cutoffggot ive got a person right now that owes 
me five hundred dollars that i wanted to take to small claims court vocnoise sil 
i even got the errorcacancelled uh the cancelled check to prove it and exteverything but 
vocnoise sil yknow uh sil and when i look at what the alternative is which 
is subjecting myself to vocnoise uh sil unfairness sil uh sil even though i feel 
i got a concrete no way sil vocnoise yknow sil uh those are the ones 
that i mean id have to pay an attorney and the cheapest one i can 
find right now is a hundred forty five dollars an hour iver and cutoffnnobody nobodys 
worth that sil you know sil so thats what im saying its so retarded sil 
uh over cutoffththe i dont mean to sil use that word in a bad way 
but its ridiculous unknownsojustbutitthatimeanuh thats better word vocnoise sil uh that sil that people have 
to uh sil vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise sil have to throw out a case 
that they may have a legitimate case because they cant afford the legal help sil 
so i think thats wrong sil in this country sil vocnoise sil the land of 
the free and the home of the brave yeah right yknow sil vocnoise sil its 
land of the free all right yeah its free country but itll cost you iver 
vocnoise i dont know sil uh sil this freedom sil semi quasi freedom sil vocnoise 
sil theres an illusion of freedom and a reality of freedom noise uh vocnoise and 
the indian people know the big difference of that iver yknow iver so sil but 
extthats yknow sil i ended up settling the attorney got most the money vocnoise what 
little i had i invested extsome and then i made some bad investments when i 
went off sil my medication sil and uh vocnoise sil yknow vocnoise sil blew it 
sil laugh sil vocnoise sil yknow so that was my responsibility my fault but uh 
sil yknow how it was just extthe years of vocnoise sil pent up frustration and 
i just sil vocnoise sil i spent it sil i spent it in a sil 
yknow unorthodox way but sil yknow well i had fun doing it iver uh sil 
vocnoise wont lie there vocnoise uh sil lot of happy strippers in town sil so 
sil vocnoise sil or i should say exotic dancers iver vocnoise sil vocnoise iver iver 
sil well something that hesi i i wanted to get into some kind of counseling 
sil vocnoise sil with people that had been through traumatic experiences sil vocnoise sil but 
i need to be at a point where sil yknow sil im sil in my 
recovery sil where i know sil i wont be sucked back down into their sil 
vocnoise way of thinking sil vocnoise sil um sil so its its a step by 
step process i sil vocnoise sil i tried to go into counseling for chemical addictions 
yknow for alcohol and drugs sil vocnoise sil but sil um the bullshit excuses i 
keep hearing from these addicts was just too much to take sil and even sil 
vocnoise sil even the bullshit excuses from former addicts iver it was like uh give 
them a license to be a screw up sil yknow sil vocnoise sil uh a 
lot of the nurses even who were former addicts yknow when it came down to 
doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done sil vocnoise they werent 
doing following protocol sil vocnoise sil and of course me id be the one saying 
hey youre not following protocol sil vocnoise sil and theyd say well yknow im a 
im a former addict im allowed to do that iver i said extno no youre 
not iver yknow sil iver extyes sil yes and cutoffaand and thats so im sil 
vocnoise im geared towards yknow with people with mental illness yknow theyve theyve diagnosed me 
with bipolar but vocnoise sil yknow my neurologist says the bipolar was a just a 
chemical imbalance as a result of vocnoise the brain sil injury sil vocnoise sil um 
sil and spiritual leaders told me that uh its a spiritual imbalance sil vocnoise theres 
theres sil really no uh chemical thing there sil vocnoise sil theres cutoffththe the problem 
is a hesboth physical mental and spiritual with the majority of the problem is spiritual 
sil vocnoise sil and when you talk to people that sil uh know that iver 
not believe it they know it iver i mean sil vocnoise sil you talk to 
people in the catholic church about the unseen sil meaning the spiritual realm sil vocnoise 
sil and they freak out iver yet they pray a prayer every sunday we believe 
in the seen and the unseen sil vocnoise ill never forget it sil because i 
recited it for god knows how many years sil vocnoise but when you talk to 
them about possession when you talk to them about demons or spirits sil vocnoise they 
freak out iver or they use the bible to say well yknow god specifically says 
in this chapter not to partake in spiritual activity sil vocnoise sil well who do 
you think wrote that sil yknow iver vocnoise sil who do you think wants to 
keep you from sil from doing something thatll help you because sil vocnoise sil people 
this land and sil indigenous tribes all over the world they dont follow the bible 
sil theyve done pretty damn good sil yknow and sil vocnoise sil um iver its 
just the cutoffspiritspiritual extthe spiritual aspect there is the realm even einstein the most vocnoised 
brilliant man supposedly mathematically of our time sil vocnoise sil ah even said that there 
will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has 
yet but nobody has taken the time or made the time sil vocnoise to challenge 
his theory iver yknow sil vocnoise sil he says that e equals m c squared 
i say its e equals m c cubed because hesthe the world is three dimensional 
vocnoise its not two dimensional sil vocnoise sil uh two dimensional limits sil everything but 
you look at his theory of relativity sil vocnoise all of our mathematical theorems vocnoise 
physical theorems on physics and things of that nature sil vocnoise sil have been based 
off that sil iver and theyre not accurate sil because ive extseen sil vocnoise things 
that are not sil physically possible iver theyre supposed to be not physically possible sil 
sil goes against the first law of physics sil vocnoise sil but i saw it 
happen sil iver i experienced it sil well sil ah sil vocnoise sil um sil 
vocnoise and some of our ceremonies extyknow uh sil vocnoise sil this is confidential right 
sil no one else is gonna see this vocnoise because i dont wanna sil vocnoise 
sil um sil i dont wanna have any of this printed or anything vocnoise yknow 
it uh vocnoise iver okay iver all right iver well in in the ambiguous part 
of it yknow just saying try to be sil protective of sil the ways iver 
of the people of this land that vocnoise sil theres in a cutoffcceremony a ceremony 
called an eneepee which is a sweat lodge sil and a lot of people will 
talk about sweat lodge um sil it involves heating up stones sil in a fire 
sil vocnoise sil and extuh vocnoise putting the stones extin extthe sil lodge sil and 
pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs sil vocnoise sil its 
not a sauna sil vocnoise sil its sil not a uh steam room iver uh 
sil vocnoise sil its a very spiritual sil experience sil yes it gets hot in 
there sil vocnoise how hot sil who knows sil but vocnoise its been such a 
strengthening sil spiritually strengthening sil thing sil vocnoise sil it also sil physically purifies you 
by so much sweat that pours out of your body because of that heat sil 
vocnoise sil um sil it gets all the crap out of you iver yknow sil 
vocnoise sil it clears you purifies you thats what it was for sil thats what 
the people used it for purification sil vocnoise sil and even sil vocnoise sil its 
made up of four rounds usually sometimes three sil vocnoise sil extuh and the last 
round is usually called the purification round sil where whoevers pouring the sweat the spiritual 
leader thats pouring the sweat sil vocnoise sil hell make it tough on you iver 
vocnoise hell pour all the water thats left in that bucket sil and hell do 
it in a way sil vocnoise sil it just brings that heat out that steam 
that breath that sacred breath is what we call it iver god sil vocnoise sil 
um sil and breathing that sil its like when we were in the womb of 
her mother sil we were breathing water sil we were breathing sil fluid sil vocnoise 
sil um sil oxygen is in that fluid too sil its in that mist that 
goes over the sil vocnoise sil the fields iver gods in that sil yknow sil 
vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise even when a cow takes a crap in the middle 
of the field and that steam comes off it in the winter time sil vocnoise 
gods in that steam sil vocnoise sil a lot of people cant understand that sil 
vocnoise sil extbut um sil vocnoise sil so cutoffthe the the laws of thermodynamics say 
that its impossible for rocks to retain heat that way and that they cant be 
heated to an adequate point of sil vocnoise sil of withholding heat iver vocnoise sil 
or sustaining heat vocnoise sil when heated by a fire iver vocnoise that sil you 
would need sil vocnoise sil extum sil like in the old days yknow to melt 
metal sil vocnoise sil they used uh air sil pumping it through iver extcoals sil 
vocnoise sil like the blacksmiths or whatever yknow sil vocnoise iver extto melt and sil 
soften the metal so they could work with it sil vocnoise sil extum sil yes 
the air would help increase the temperature sil vocnoise sil but sil a fire kept 
for a long period of time sil will be hotter than any kind of fire 
youve ever touched sil or been around sil vocnoise sil and that fire is sacred 
its a sacred fire vocnoise uh sil vocnoise sil so thats why its possible sil 
but sil if it sil if i went down there with the laws of physics 
vocnoise told me that those rocks sil couldnt sustain heat sil vocnoise sil yet i 
see when the fire keeper breaks them out of the sil vocnoise sil out of 
the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that theyre red orange glowing 
sil you gonna tell me theyre not hot sil so thats thats one example sil 
vocnoise sil um iver sil yes iver ive done it sil for the last uh 
sil bout five years iver uh sil how many i dont know it doesnt matter 
vocnoise um vocnoise sil been in extin vocnoise many ones that were sil too hard 
for me sil iver sil and i had to get out sil uh sil and 
other ones cutoffiit its a its a struggle sil with that thing and understanding it 
sil takes time to understand it sil vocnoise sil lot of people lot of good 
people are helping me sil to try and understand it sil vocnoise sil um sil 
i was trying to let the fear of that sil um sil vocnoise though im 
not afraid to die sil vocnoise sil im afraid sometimes that ill die before i 
get a chance to do sil what i feel i was sent here to do 
sil which is just the basic things sil vocnoise sil fall in love with somebody 
have children raise them iver and move on sil vocnoise sil um sil thats thats 
basically my fear sil but sil vocnoise sil uh as one of the guys tried 
to help me he said well listen im afraid of that too and he said 
because right there in that pit there thats god sil vocnoise sil now if you 
remember that sil theres nothing in here that can hurt you sil even as hot 
as it gets sil yknow sil vocnoise sil and when you think about that noise 
vocnoise sil you try not to think too much while youre in there sil although 
its hard to do especially if youre thinking about how hot it is sil vocnoise 
but if youre listening to people praying sil and theyre praying with their heart and 
i tell you sil vocnoise because of how hot it gets in there sil youll 
hear people pray straight from their heart sil not a bunch of real fancy words 
sil vocnoise sil in a real comfortable setting yknow sil vocnoise that sil that heat 
iver will that sacred heat will iver bring sil whats in your heart out sil 
and sometimes youll say stuff that doesnt even make sense sil but sil you say 
it sil and it brings it out sil vocnoise sil and thats what its for 
sil so i mean its uh vocnoise sil its a struggle understanding that and uh 
sil vocnoise sil i i made it through all four rounds this time sil vocnoise 
sil and uh i even sat up which was the first time sil um sil 
vocnoise its a struggle sil but its a sil vocnoise sil vocnoise its necessary for 
the way i follow sil if i didnt especially for men women have a purification 
every month iver with their cycle vocnoise uh thats sil the way the indian people 
believe that many of the woman refer to it as theyre on their moon sil 
vocnoise because when the moons out the moon is that sacred sil and theres that 
sil vocnoise sil that life vocnoise women have that sil vocnoise sil uh gift of 
life that they can give sil uh men cant do that sil vocnoise sil um 
sil theres just a lot there sil that uh sil vocnoise sil yknow women go 
through that purification every month so women really dont need the sweat lodge sil vocnoise 
sil but its there for them sil vocnoise sil and they do participate sil vocnoise 
sil um iver ive been some places where some men refuse to sweat with women 
sil vocnoise sil sometimes i vocnoise felt sil kinda weird about it iver just because 
uh sil vocnoise sil um sil women have a medicine sil yknow sil vocnoise sil 
and probably because that was lacking in my life sil vocnoise sil um sil i 
couldnt focus on what i needed to focus on when i heard a womans voice 
in there sil vocnoise sil but then some of the elders sat me down and 
and the other thing about the sweat lodge is men go in there in shorts 
sil vocnoise sil women go in there in a long cotton dress sil vocnoise sil 
youll hear people say you go in there naked iver vocnoise sil uh thats not 
true sil i mean uh sil vocnoise sil some of the older men in older 
tribes and different tribes vocnoise sil um iver theyll be naked but theyll still go 
in with a huge towel on iver yknow sil vocnoise iver so its not a 
sil vocnoise there was a man named sun bear sil vocnoise sil who was uh 
sil recruiting women sil yknow sil and telling them they had to sweat naked iver 
yknow sil so he could get a look at them sil vocnoise sil which is 
very disrespectful but sil yknow sil vocnoise sil theres some psychos out there man i 
mean theres some psycho around here in town called rainbow eagle sil vocnoise gave himself 
that name iver didnt earn it the indian way iver vocnoise didnt have it done 
through ceremony nothing like that sil vocnoise sil and even the man that he followed 
for a while sitting in a rest home over in south dakota now sil vocnoise 
because hes old sil hes on his way out sil vocnoise sil and he was 
a road man gave his life yknow for eighty nine tribes sil to help them 
find and refine their connection with their spirituality that theyd lost sil vocnoise sil um 
because of the missionaries sil bringing christianity sil i mean sil vocnoise sil um sil 
iver vocnoise ive got nothing against christianity sil but i got something against the way 
it was brought here iver and thats what im saying atoning for sins sil vocnoise 
its quite a hypocrisy when you got a sil vocnoise church telling you that you 
need to ask for forgiveness when sil vocnoise sil what they did i mean in 
the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents unknown and went to 
all my life sil vocnoise sil over the door of the church was a picture 
of christopher columbus with sil sil a missionary sil vocnoise sil a priest sil vocnoise 
sil and all his men with his sword drawn sil vocnoise sil a dead native 
american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear sil 
vocnoise sil now sil i asked the priest sil cold hard question sil sil vocnoise 
is that sil the way jesus christ would have brought that here sil well some 
people have their opinion and i said no sil no sil i say you you 
wear that collar sil you do something about that if you dont vocnoise then i 
realize what a spineless person you are sil but youll never find me in your 
church again sil so ive done what ive done but vocnoise theres a lot of 
people out there thatll read a book on native american spirituality vocnoise and theyll become 
self proclaimed spiritual leaders sil uh theyll learn the sweats theres some people that have 
taken pictures of sweat lodges which youre not supposed to do sil vocnoise sil uh 
they show step by step how to build one sil vocnoise and tell extwordyou sil 
that some kind of wood to build it out of extand ninety percent of the 
time they tell you the wrong kind of wood vocnoise sil um theres a way 
to do it vocnoise and theres a way to do it uh sil it has 
to be done that way traditionally there was a reason for that sil vocnoise sil 
um sil because the people of this land were given specific instructions sil vocnoise sil 
from their creator through visions vocnoise through a woman called the cutoffbubuffalo white buffalo calf 
woman that came to the people and brought them vocnoise these ceremonies like the sweat 
lodge sil vocnoise sil they brought them the sacred pipe sil vocnoise its not a 
sil vocnoise sil its not a belief thing sil vocnoise sil its a way of 
life sil and its a way of life thats still in danger of being snuffed 
out sil vocnoise but it wont be sil its just sil it wont be sil 
its just we gotta be careful about sil vocnoise sil uh how and what you 
do and if you look extyknow native american spirituality or religion for lack of a 
better word vocnoise sil ah because our people believe that religion you cant uh sil 
vocnoise sil you cant encompass one word exteverything that is in the one word iver 
sil all of creation sil into religion sil all of what spirituality is into one 
word religion hesyou you cant sil vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise sil but when you 
say its a cutoffspiritual of spiritual nature sil thats sil yknow thats still leaving the 
door wide open that its its broad its bigger than you or me sil vocnoise 
sil ah sil vocnoise but that ah sil that whole thing is um sil vocnoise 
yknow the people of the land had a cutoffspspecific a specific instructions sil on how 
to do things sil vocnoise sil and i im not saying they were perfect either 
sil there were a lot of indian people and there are a lot of indian 
people out there that are crooked as a dogs hind leg vocnoise thats just the 
way it is sil vocnoise theyre corrupt the money has corrupt them the lack of 
money has corrupted them power has corrupted them sil vocnoise sil um they wanna be 
a spiritual leader why i dont know sil vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise sil to 
me its an ego thing sil vocnoise sil and uh this rainbow eagle guy had 
some kind of buffalo uh sil vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise sil what do you 
call it a extbuffalo ceremony sil vocnoise sil but he charged everybody sil native people 
dont do that sil i mean sil traditional native people cutoffththey sil hesyou sil you 
dont charge people that wanna come learn about god sil vocnoise theres some people in 
california sil vocnoise that say certain ceremonies were a native sil thing and they buried 
a woman in the ground with a straw vocnoise told her it was some ritual 
of proving and over coming fear sil vocnoise sil yet the lady was an asthmatic 
and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw sil vocnoise sil in her mouth and 
she couldnt breath and breathed in all the sand and died sil vocnoise sil and 
so the first thing they put in the paper is that another native ceremony shows 
us how sil vocnoise sil native american spirituality should be sil outlawed sil vocnoise sil 
and if you look at any kind of sil vocnoise sil uh spirituality religion thats 
out there native americans are only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can 
and cant have vocnoise that theres blood quantums sil vocnoise sil saying that if you 
have a fourth sil vocnoise sil or a half sil iver vocnoise sil and even 
sil vocnoise sil if you had two full bloods sil from two different tribes sil 
and they had a child sil vocnoise the federal government still considers them a half 
blood sil vocnoise iver sil why i dont know sil doesnt make sense iver sil 
but the federal government and their lawyers have done that sil vocnoise sil and the 
department of the interior sil vocnoise sil still considers native americans sil vocnoise on the 
same level as a dog sil they dont have sil something wrong there sil and 
that still goes on today after about six hundred years sil vocnoise sil and we 
got good people in this country that wanna do something about it sil vocnoise sil 
but unfortunately sil cutoffththey extyknow what im finding sil vocnoise sil cutoffyyou you got everybodys 
gotta choose their path iver vocnoise theres the ones thatll get out there with their 
picket signs sil vocnoise sil and raise hell sil okay iver vocnoise sil me i 
dont wanna go to unknown jail and get arrested because i feel i wont do 
my people sil any service by being in jail iver sil vocnoise but there are 
those that are out there that are sil vocnoise sil willing to do that iver 
warriors that are out there men and women thatll do that sil vocnoise sil uh 
more power to them sil vocnoise uh sil all i can do is pray about 
it sil and thats what i suggest to everybody else vocnoise thats the most powerful 
thing that you can do sil even one of the extnuns vocnoise in high school 
sil that taught me had a poster on the wall that said sil sil sil 
extmore things are wrought in this world by prayer sil then well ever know iver 
and thats true sil vocnoise sil um sil so thats the most powerful thing i 
can do sil when i can turn it over to god and say god this 
is too damn big for me to handle sil vocnoise sil you think you can 
work on maybe helping change this persons heart vocnoise or their mind sil because i 
cant do that sil vocnoise um sil so sil yknow sil vocnoise sil i didnt 
mean to get laughoffonatangentthere iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver hesin hesin much hesin much other 
things sil yknow that im sil unknown coming to understand sil iver vocnoise theres uh 
sil yknow i just uh is vocnoise i had three spiritual leaders sil tell me 
that sil vocnoise sil a great gift came with that sil vocnoise sil that there 
was it was no accident sil vocnoise sil it was supposed to happen sil vocnoise 
sil and uh theres a word called synchronicity iver that um sil vocnoise sil encompasses 
the vocnoise uh theory that sil all things happen for a reason sil vocnoise sil 
even though it seems like its chaos sil even though it seems like its an 
accident sil vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise sil theres sil vocnoise sil a flow sil 
of spirit in this world things sil are moving sil at a pace that theyre 
supposed to move at sil vocnoise sil and things happen sil and death is part 
of life sil physical death sil and thats one of the things i also learned 
through this was that vocnoise sil you dont die sil you dont sil physically sil 
maybe sil yknow sil theres no denying that sil but sil spiritually sil vocnoise sil 
not even physical death can break that sil it wont sil iver vocnoise sil hesyeah 
sil and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people 
sil i mean actually seeing sil spirits sil in other people in terms of sil 
vocnoise sil someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul sil thats very 
true sil yknow sil vocnoise sil i could see sil in certain peoples exteyes when 
i was in the hospital sil the confusion sil vocnoise sil extthe sil unsure sil 
feelings sil yknow the sil vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise sil i dont know sil 
i didnt theres something that i could see there that i cant explain and i 
still cant explain it sil vocnoise sil i just extknow what i extsee sil vocnoise 
sil and then i go and try and tell the psychologist psychiatrist well they want 
to put me on some kind of sil vocnoise sil anti hallucinogenic sil medication and 
i said well listen man sil yknow sil vocnoise im not hallucinating iver sil vocnoise 
sil and these people that hear voices vocnoise theyre not hallucinating sil theyre hearing voices 
of spirits sil and in many cultures theyll tell you most the indigenous cultures vocnoise 
throughout the world will tell you sil vocnoise sil and the history will show vocnoise 
that those people were revered as gifted sil iver sil this is the only society 
sil vocnoise sil that sil labels them sil mentally ill sil iver vocnoise and extbecause 
largely because of the fear of not knowing sil vocnoise sil and not knowing how 
to deal with the unseen iver sil iver so iver vocnoise yeah he did iver 
sil theres no doubt in my mind that he sil vocnoise sil heard those voices 
now whether they were actual sil vocnoise sil audible voices sil or sil whether they 
were voices from the inside iver in his own mind sil vocnoise sil regardless its 
part of that bad spirit that people have created sil not the devil sil not 
satan sil to the native people he doesnt extexist sil and to me he doesnt 
exist sil vocnoise sil hes a piece of shit sil vocnoise sil but hes real 
sil iver sil vocnoise and hes real because people give him that iver sil they 
believe in him sil they empower that sil that extfear of him sil vocnoise sil 
empowers it sil his existence sil vocnoise sil when you got like minded people around 
yknow sil sil sil you can create a spirit sil iver sil a bad one 
sil or a good one sil iver sil vocnoise sil so sil this boy sil 
vocnoise whatever he did sil vocnoise sil um sil yeah theres no doubt in my 
mind that he either heard sil vocnoise sil internal voices or sil ah actual audible 
voices of spirits that were sil vocnoise sil ah sil misguided spirits iver while they 
were here sil there are many people that were bad eggs man sil vocnoise sil 
and then they physically died sil before they got a chance to live sil vocnoise 
and when their spirit wakes up sil vocnoise sil and finds out that theyre physically 
dead and they cant do anything in a physical world anymore vocnoise they want to 
sil draw themselves to especially if they were a bad person sil vocnoisewordword sil they 
want to draw them to sil vocnoise the brightest thing iver sil which are sil 
children of light iver and as the way i put it its kind of new 
agey and i dont like new agey stuff but vocnoise sil yknow its extthe best 
example is moths sil from the dark when you flip on a light sil the 
moths will go right to it sil vocnoise a child like that sil vocnoise a 
young man like that is very impressionable very young still sil vocnoise sil and uh 
these bad spirits will be sil flocked right to him iver vocnoise sil um sil 
so when he did that though i mean sil vocnoise sil vocnoise theres medication out 
there that can help people like i said i dont wanna see people with brain 
injury sil vocnoise with mental illness vocnoise sil or with any kind of disability sil 
vocnoise sil use that sil as an excuse sil iver sil for their behavior sil 
because sil vocnoise sil if they were an asshole before their brain injury sil theyre 
gonna be sil vocnoise an asshole after their brain injury five times iver vocnoise iver 
um vocnoise its magnified hesand hesand hesor sil extyeah they have that choice they can 
say well listen sil vocnoise you dont understand and blah blah blah now ive tried 
that sil vocnoise but the best i can do now is try and advocate for 
myself in terms of listen sil vocnoise uh i hear what youre saying sil but 
im trying to show you that sil uh sil and tell you how i work 
best vocnoise sil so as long as you can try not to dictate to me 
sil vocnoise sil and allow me some freedom sil vocnoise sil and give me goals 
of what you want accomplished and give me the freedom to accomplish them the way 
that i can do it sil vocnoise sil um not by quotas sil vocnoise sil 
and deadlines and sil crap like that sil vocnoise um sil vocnoise i can show 
you what to do and hesthats hesthats the struggle im having right now im trying 
to find employment where people will sil vocnoise sil cut me some slack yknow and 
i wanted to do some driving but sil yknow sil vocnoise sil uh because at 
least out on the road yknow sil vocnoise i dont have to put up with 
anyones crap vocnoise sil but sil long driving long distances is not good for me 
sil focusing and concentrating sil vocnoise sil um sil and i ive had vocnoise yknow 
several accidents several tickets sil vocnoise um so sil vocnoise sil i mean ive even 
had uh sil vocnoise yknow two other head injuries sil iver sil as a result 
of sil the one sil vocnoise trying to force myself back into what to do 
so i mean its cutoffjujust sil vocnoise yeah i mean when i when you come 
down to these things theres uh sil vocnoise people with mental illness and with a 
disability sil vocnoise are trying to pawn off their responsibility onto sil vocnoise sil everybody 
but themselves sil vocnoise sil yknow well the medical doctors if they would of sil 
vocnoise sil seen this guy and given him medication he wouldnt of went out there 
and vocnoise killed somebody sil yknow shoulda would have could have man sil vocnoise sil 
if the guy stopped taking his medication of his own free will sil vocnoise that 
was his responsibility to take that medicine every day sil vocnoise just like its mine 
take mine every day sil vocnoise sil and when i stop taking mine that was 
my responsibility which is why sil vocnoise sil i dont wanna go to the legal 
system to try and sil vocnoise sil make an excuse sil even though theres a 
sil vocnoise theres a sil vocnoise some law that protects people that if they were 
drunk sil or sil vocnoise on the influence of medication or sil vocnoise or off 
the influence of medication sil vocnoise sil um sil unknown in case they bought a 
house or signed into some kind of contract sil vocnoise sil that they wouldnt be 
vocnoise sil liable sil iver sil and im saying sil vocnoise sil i could take 
that route sil but it it would cost me a lot of money that i 
dont have sil to get the legal defense sil vocnoise sil and it be just 
vocnoise best for me to take the responsibility like i have sil vocnoise sil and 
i sold the car that i had to my sister sil vocnoise sil uh im 
going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed a lease for vocnoise vocnoise 
sil uh sil but im gonna make them come after me sil laughyknow sil vocnoise 
laughimeanuh sil vocnoise uh sil i already went to court once and sil and uh 
sil vocnoise sil cutoffeveven well i even cutoffwiwith even with the evidence being in my 
favor sil i mean i was only at this place three months sil vocnoise sil 
i didnt do any damage to it sil vocnoise sil um sil and the walls 
did not need painted i wasnt there long enough to make them dirty sil vocnoise 
sil uh but um sil vocnoise their own person even went through on a first 
run through after i moved out vocnoise vocnoise sil and my mother and i cleaned 
that thing spotless top bottom bathrooms and washed the floors and mopped the floors and 
everything sil vocnoise and uh their own person came through an said it rated the 
paint an a which meant according to their system a meant no iver no painting 
was needed sil vocnoise sil uh well then sil then as a result they they 
went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh sil vocnoise sil yknow 
sil get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway 
and they uh scratched out the first rating and sil vocnoise changed it to a 
lower rating sil vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise and even though that evidence was in 
front of a magistrate iver and he could see sil uh id assume hes educated 
and not stupid otherwise he wouldnt be a magistrate sil vocnoise could see that that 
person did that iver sil vocnoise and it was suspect sil vocnoise sil ah he 
still ruled in their favor iver sil so im not gonna get any fairness or 
justice out of that but vocnoise sil uh so they sent me the award saying 
that they decided in their favor and all that crap well sil yknow fine sil

in the animal area even as a vet assistant but sil vocnoise sil um with 
domestic animals um iver sil theres a lot of uh sil vocnoise sil i dont

um help people that have other physical disabilities um sil vocnoise hesyou you can tell 
from the way the extdog extis sil in terms of uh sil vocnoise sil with 
with the cutoffwway the way the dog behaves with the person that has the disability 
sil vocnoise sil uh that they been trained for um sil you can tell sil 
whether theyve been sil errortretrained trained the right way or whatever so sil vocnoise sil 
i thought about that but vocnoise yknow sil um vocnoise sil hesi yknow i havent 
given it much more then sil yknow just the thought but yknow i looked in 
the veterinary assistant i went in there and it wasnt uh sil vocnoise sil yknow 
i was there just for a half a day and yknow they were telling me 
about some of these people out there extthat uh sil laugh sil yknow i dont 
understand the law again but yknow sil vocnoise theres people out there that will go 
out and will buy a dog sil yknow sil nice dog sil and uh because 
they dont wanna make the time to train it sil and spend the time with 
it because they take a lot of time and discipline and sil vocnoise love and 
care sil vocnoise just like a child iver vocnoise sil um sil they more less

vocnoise sil extor a conversation piece extyknow or some kind of trophy well heres my 
heres my dog my extlabrador ah yeah full sil vocnoise sil and uh a lot 
of these people sil were vocnoise uh the dogs were vocnoise reacting in a sil 
vocnoise sil they were objective yknow and they extwere vocnoise because they werent being paid 
attention to sil vocnoise sil and they were pissing on the carpet and sil vocnoise 
sil making messes and chewing things up and sil vocnoise sil and these people would 
bring them in and uh sil uh have them put to sleep iver vocnoise sil 
and i couldnt be part of a veterinary practice that uh did that iver sil 
and unfortunately sil vocnoise they have to do what the people with the pets say 
sil vocnoise but its just i couldnt be around that and extthen yknow i would 
go off on people that would do that bring that in sil i just feel 
that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth laughsometimes vocnoise 
sil ah im not a violent man either even as big as i am yknow 
yknow sil vocnoise iver sil yeah up on bethel road iver sil thats iver umhum 
sil yeah i sil yeah like i said i dont know i i just i 
got to make some decisions here sil yknow uh i dont want to put too 
much pressure on it yknow one of the elders told me hey yknow sil cut 
yourself some slack and just vocnoise relax for awhile sil yknow because i worked in 
a movie theatre for a year sil and yknow i got hassled sil and sil 
about my hair sil yknow sil uh sil told me the only thing keeping me 
from sil moving up in the company was a pair of scissors sil iver sil 
yknow and i just told him well it has to do with my belief system 
so youre in violation of the first amendment sil yknow sil vocnoise sil extso and 
then they realized that i wasnt stupid sil so sil yknow they just made things 
more and more difficult for me sil yknow so i just decided to sil vocnoise 
sil since they werent gonna sil vocnoise change i was just gonna leave sil yknow 
sil but sil vocnoise so its yknow hesits its a hard extway vocnoise you choose 
extto extwalk uh if youre not idealistic person its sil vocnoise sil i mean just 
more so me i i dont sil like i said i dont try and dwell 
on the negative yknow but sil vocnoise sil uh it very easy to get sucked 
in to whats wrong out there sil vocnoise and its also very easy to get 
sucked into the attitude well im gonna change this sil vocnoise sil vocnoise you know 
if you extcan sil you do what you can do as a human being sil 
vocnoise that alone sil is good enough sil iver and and thats what a lot 
of people are telling me yknow just sil vocnoise sil yknow sil vocnoise lifes a 
struggle sil iver vocnoise anyway sil yknow so sil vocnoise just simply living sil iver 
yknow for me getting out of bed sil is sil is a victory sil vocnoise 
sil yknow sil for the longest time i was so depressed sil yknow but sil 
vocnoise the animals you know yeah using the animals uh sil vocnoise sil uh for 
therapy animal therapy um sil i mean dogs in particular cats sil um sil vocnoise 
sil but know theres sil vocnoise sil uh theres some animals that arent sil to 
be pets yknow um theyre wild animals sil yknow and sil vocnoise yeah i saw 
a show last week on fox that sil vocnoise sil was called when good pets 
go bad too sil iver and none of the animals they profiled were pets sil 
i mean a thirty six foot long python what the hells a person doing with 
that as a pet sil vocnoise sil they shouldnt be allowed to sil vocnoise sil 
and then people treating a buffalo sil like they could stand next to it and 
take a family picture iver vocnoise doesnt show any knowledge or respect to the animal 
iver vocnoise thats a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted 
twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out sil vocnoise extin 
my opinion when that stuff happens when i see sil vocnoise sil when i see 
someone light the horns of a bull on fire in spain and torment the bull 
and then all of a sudden the bull gets the flames put out vocnoise sil 
and the bull runs his gourd through sil vocnoise the persons leg and throws him 
around and kicks him right near death i dont have any sympathy for him iver 
vocnoise iver oh im not shocked to the bad behavior of the cutoffanimaanimal i dont 
consider its justice iver well i mean iver laugh vocnoise sil well the humans that 
started it and the man narrating the thing said there wasnt a single animal that 
they profiled in the thing that uh sil vocnoise sil um sil behaved the way 
it did on its own accord iver sil it behaved that way as a result 
of the way it was being treated by human beings sil vocnoise sil so i 
mean theres a i mean sil vocnoise sil yeah the animal therapy is very good 
thing my dog has been very sil vocnoise um vocnoise supportive been very sil vocnoise 
sil you know like you said the unconditional love part yknow i mean how you 
could vocnoise sil you could vocnoise you could leave for a week and come back 
and theyre vocnoise theyre like ok sil laugh sil vocnoise sil im glad youre back 
yknow sil iver none of this where have you been sil laughshityknow iver laugh sil 
vocnoise iver vocnoise sil laughok iver exclude iver okay iver laugh sil vocnoise iver laugh 
yes pets are iver okay sil i was born in dayton ohio sil i lived 
there almost thirty five years before moving to columbus in nineteen eighty one sil uh 
lived in uh sil north west columbus for eighteen years sil uh moved last january 
a little farther west about five miles further west near hilliard vocnoise but still live 
in the city of columbus sil uh so ive been here about eighteen nineteen years 
i like columbus also sil i think its a great city although the last three 
months ive threatened to move on more than one occasion because of all the traffic 
congestion and all of the road construction you just cant get anywhere sil its very 
frustrating sil uh but other than that columbus is a great city sil um sil 
i went to this is something different about me most people dont know that uh 
it it existed in the the twentieth century but i went to an all girl 
catholic school for twelve years sil uh so there were there were no boys and 
i wasnt in a classroom with boys until i got to college sil uh i 
went to college at wright state university sil uh my parents couldnt afford to send 
me so i had to work two years in high school two years after high 
school to pay my way through college sil um vocnoise taught school for about eight 
and a half nine years and during that time got my masters degree in remedial 
reading sil um taught for i vocnoise think i said this about eight and a 
half nine years and sil my sil life and career took a whole different turn 
and became president of my teachers association or teachers union and vocnoise that led to 
a job in political action because id always been active in politics from high school 
on sil uh the first campaign i worked in was for john kennedy in nineteen 
sixty i was a freshman in high school and vocnoise continued working in campaigns in 
a volunteer status uh several different campaigns in ohio and in dayton where i came 
from sil uh but moved to columbus to take a job as a political action 
consultant for the largest public employee union vocnoise did that for a couple of years 
till i went out in the field and negotiated labor contracts sil um did that 
thats kind of stressful um um sil so i decided to strike off on my 
own and try some public relations and marketing and did that and sil um vocnoise 
im unknowndidnt never been married sil didnt plan that that wasnt a goal in life 
it just laughneveroccurred sil uh so i have no kids but i have a pet 
sil and now im uh i call myself semi retired i get a small um 
yknow monthly retirement and then i supplement my income by doing things like this sil 
im an independent contractor i do training i do um vocnoise different things yknow where 
people get my opinion ive done a couple of the um things with uh sil 
lawyers looking yknow they do like mock trials sil on real issues sil and then 
you listen to all of the stuff and then you sil cutoffppretend yknow pretend that 
youre a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it 
in forming their case unknown going to going into court so thats fun sil so 
thats a little bit about me uh lets see sil my family my mom and 
dad sil um well im im sil uh my mother was first generation sil american 
my grandparents came to this country from hungary sil and that was a neat experience 
i liked growing up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a 
peasant in hungary sil uh and he thought this was the cutoffggreatest greatest country in 
the world and that rubbed off on me i still do also sil he always 
voted so unknown yknow sil i learned at an early age that its important to 
vote sil um sil my mom and dad were both alcoholics sil um i have 
two brothers no sisters sil one older than me one younger than me sil um 
and i have no children but i have a pet that is my child sil 
vocnoise and i always say pets are uh children you raise pets you spoil vocnoise 
so my my pet is sil very spoiled iver thats right laugh laughthatsright laugh sil 
its a parakeet iver a parakeet yes sil little two and a half three ounce 
ball of fluff iver oh yeah iver oh sil wow yeah sil iver umhum iver 
i had that with uh sil the parakeet i had before vocnoise their lifespan in 
the wild is about five years seven years in captivity and he was thirteen iver 
yeah iver umhum iver right sil the hardest cutoffboboth both the hardest and easiest thing 
i think ive ever done sil was knowing when it was time to take him 
to the vet to have him euthanized iver umhum iver yeah iver hum sil right 
sil you know you have to you know you dont have a choice but at 
the same time you cutoffduhdont right you dont want them to suffer but you want 
to keep them sil but sil it is vocnoise whoops sil oops sil i hope 
i didnt move iver put my hand here sil try to keep it out the 
line of the sil wire iver laugh iver yeah no problem iver yes sil umhum 
iver umhum iver right iver right laugh iver umhum iver me too iver vocnoise yeah 
i really dont know i dont understand why they dont because to me sil its 
the most important freedom we have sil and people v um sil bitch and complain 
all the time vocnoise but then when you ask them if they voted they go 
no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you dont because your 
voice sil wasnt heard sil um sil when i was a political action consultant for 
the ohio education association i used to go around try to get teachers involved in 
politics sil um and one of the things i would tell them is that sil 
every vote is important john kennedy won if if sil if you would take all 
of the the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation vocnoise 
by one vote per cutoffpersprecinct sil per precinct sil one vote per precinct sil yknow 
if there had just been one additional vote either way in any of those precincts 
yknow he would have lost sil uh and so one vote does count sil and 
i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two 
votes sil and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school 
levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven sil eighteen nineteen 
votes sil um sil if i knew the magic sil reason why people dont vote 
sil i could sell that sil and make a sil make a fortune sil um 
but i dont know what it is iver vocnoise iver when i did school levy 
campaigns sil uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is 
is sil what the cutoffccampaign the vocnoise campaign does on election day called get out 
the vote vocnoise thats the most important thing that can be done sil um sil 
i used to sil always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school 
levy vocnoise get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had 
a very limited population in a school district sil and i would have the school 
district compare it to sil parents and the first thing id do is register parents 
sil because many of them vocnoise dont vote sil uh and i read a study 
somewhere that the average person in this country doesnt even begin to vote until theyre 
forty sil if i had known that when i was in college sil and worked 
so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i couldnt vote till i 
was twenty one sil and i was upset sil yknow because i wanted to vote 
for certain candidates because of the vietnam war sil that was a big issue and 
i couldnt sil uh i had to wait till i was twenty one so there 
were a bunch of us at college that sil yknow worked and did some volunteer 
work to get that whole thing changed sil if id known that they werent gonna 
vote at eighteen sil and they were gonna wait until they were almost forty sil 
i wouldnt of i wouldnt of wasted my time sil um but anyway um sil 
cutoffyyou sil you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second 
third grade age vocnoise vocnoise and you register them sil and then you just keep 
after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get 
out the vote campaign sil uh in ohio i think its easier to do that 
because there is a law that sil vocnoise i dont think its in primaries vocnoise 
but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the 
afternoon vocnoise they hafta list those who have voted they hafta put up a list 
of uh sil registered voters and cross out those who have voted sil so what 
i useta do is i took my list that i had gotten from the board 
of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support sil 
or cutoffwerwere was undecided on the election sil and i would cross off those that 
had voted sil and then i had a list of those that hadnt sil and 
i had people waiting at a phone bank sil and id call them at work 
or at home and and id offer to take them to the polls sil if 
you dont have a ride sil uh we will take you to the polls sil 
if youre worried about yknow someone watching your kids we have certified teachers who will 
sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will 
babysit for you while you go to vote vocnoise because ive also read studies that 
say people who are routed from their home or their office sil yknow and are 
reminded to go vote sil will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded 
them to do that vocnoise because what i did was is a very low key 
thing i would call people on election day and say sil hi this is roberta 
im calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you 
will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote sil and 
oh by the way sil oh when you go to vote we hope that you 
will vote for such and such a school levy and sil and if you need 
a ride let me know weve got them set up for you sil and vocnoise 
but yknow thats very sil i mean cutoffehand and and thats not getting people to 
vote sil and encourage them to vote because they should thats a a special campaign 
for a particular issue or a candidate sil i dont know how you get people 
to vote sil i dont know why they dont think its important maybe because sil 
weve had it too easy my errorgogodfather sil my grandfather didnt sil my grandfather didnt 
i mean there was a king and queen and yknow he had no right to 
vote sil so that when he came here and he could sil that was the 
most important thing in the world to him sil yknow and that that he just 
passed it on to sil yknow his daughter my mother sil my father i dont 
know how he sil it was important to him but it was always important to 
him and we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes sil we talked about 
sil issues and he said yknow it was important to to be heard sil so 
i dont know if it was that sil it got passed on parent wise or 
what it was sil iver umhum iver vocnoise iver theres no issue iver umhum iver 
right iver vocnoise sil not specifically no sil uh sometimes um little groups sil of 
vocnoise sometimes you cutoffwouwould cutoffiif if there was a college in a community when i 
was running a school levy campaign sil um we would try to get them either 
registered sil and and active in a campaign sil um sil but it was very 
difficult sil cutoffiits its sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park 
sil active in voting sil yknow there are certain little blocks of people sil uh 
and on school levies the people who voted no which were senior citizens sil i 
mean they they went to the polls in droves you didnt hafta yknow the the 
the cutoffhhope sil the hope there was that they wouldnt go to vote laugh sil 
on the school levy vocnoise uh but actually trying to get college kids involved sil 
i havent really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself sil 
it might be a little pocket of a campaign but sil nothing big iver umhum 
iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver if if you didnt own lets say on a school 
levy and you didnt uh you sil you pay taxes i always get because i 
rent and i always get very upset and im very angry when people say sil 
well you dont hafta pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school 
tax passes sil my rent goes up sil its built into the rent sil uh 
at least its vocnoise it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord 
laugh sil uh and i dont ive never lived any place where my rent didnt 
go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct f proportion and beyond 
cutoffjjust yknow uh of what the levy was vocnoise uh so that would be the 
first thing id say sil and then id also say that yknow vocnoise uh because 
uh a cutoffllot a cutoffllot a number of reasons that people dont vote for school 
levies now is because they dont have kids sil in the schools sil yknow but 
education is the foundation of a democracy sil and if you dont have an educated 
citizenry sil uh cutoffyyour your cutoffvvoters sil democracy could go down the drain sil um 
that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or yknow the the university of 
virginia and believed in education yknow because he said without an educated citizenry you wont 
understand the issues sil yknow but its very difficult today sil to get to people 
sil um vocnoise ive talked to some sil ive vocnoise sil almost college age students 
and they dont see the relationship you can vocnoise talk logic to them all you 
want and its not like the logic gets to them sil and you can talk 
history all you want and it doesnt mean anything to them and i dont know 
why sil i wish i did but i dont know why iver vocnoise iver i 
think the latter i dont think itll make any difference vocnoise the kids that i 
know sil in uh junior high and in in yknow college sil uh it just 
doesnt make any difference to them and they dont like those classes they think theyre 
boring they think it has no relevance to their life iver vocnoise yeah noise sil 
it sil it might and yknow good teachers do that i i cutoffusused i still 
get upset when i was teaching school i did activity based teaching sil um sil 
and i was doing some volunteer work at dublin schools it was supposed be one 
of the better schools in the area sil and i thought thered be all sorts 
of creative things going on and there wasnt it was still read the chapter write 
the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought sil 
how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things 
sil um sil im not sure theres so much sil influence from the media sil 
uh and i say media broad based so youd be it print media or tv 
sil um that has this culture today of um noise sil vocnoise stars and yknow 
media of of vocnoise phenomenons and sil and vocnoise they dont see the relevance and 
i dont think they hear from their parents like i did vocnoise the importance of 
voting and thats where it comes from their parents dont vote sil so if their 
parents dont vote they arent sil uh again i dont know what the the answer 
is sil um but its very scary whats gonna happen in the next couple of 
generations vocnoise the only sil vocnoise good thought for me is i think about this 
sil is that i wont be here to see the disintegration of the democracy although 
i have great faith too sil i have great faith in democracy sil um vocnoise 
there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if there were 
an issue sil i think kids would cutoffgeget if if there were sil kids in 
college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people 
didnt think was important sil or had no real relevance to their lives sil i 
mean unknowndo sil i think the kids would vocnoise would rally immediately sil and cutoffththe 
the issue right now is that theres nothing there iver right laugh iver the cutoffriright 
iver umhum iver vocnoise it sil it might sil uh it might sil um i 
was gonna say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one 
of the best campaigns ive seen in recent years utilizing college age students has been 
clintons campaign both times sil uh he knew he needed to get a base to 
increase sil um his chances of winning the election sil and did especially in the 
first campaign in and and i believe that was ninety two vocnoise did a really 
super job of organizing college students because thats when youre at your most um sil 
well when you believe in things and youre at your most idealistic sil and you 
would think that yknow vocnoise kids would automatically be interested in something and he was 
able to tap into that sil um sil in addition to that sil and as 
an sil under current it wasnt sil overt in the clinton campaign vocnoise but i 
know when i talked to people sil uh and you have to be careful where 
you do this because abortion is an a very divisive issue in this country and 
i think it it does mobilize people vocnoise but it also divides them sil yknow 
cutoffddefinitively definitively almost like in vietnam almost like that war divided people sil um but 
i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton vocnoise because 
it was the difference between protecting roe versus wade and not sil and in protecting 
choice yknow i um sil and i im starting to see that now even in 
in the gore campaign there ive seen a couple of editorials in the paper sil 
about yknow the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three 
sil supreme court justices and at that if you want to protect that right sil 
youve gotta vote with the candidate whos gonna put the best justices on the supreme 
court sil and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way 
cutoffbboth sil both in ninety two and again in four years cutofflalater in ninety six 
sil uh and i think thats gonna happen again sil uh because the vocnoise the 
candidates and im telling you my politics here laughveryclearly and early vocnoise but the candidates 
have pretty well spoken on that issue already sil i know which one will protect 
the right for choice sil uh and vocnoise sil um sil uh i think we 
need to protect that so yes i think it will but i dont think its 
an sil issue that if you vocnoise did sil overtly and said yknow support candidate 
a over candidate b vocnoise because theyll protect abortion rights vocnoise thats gonna divide the 
country and not keep us together iver umhum iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver right iver 
vocnoise umhum iver vocnoise sil and thats essentially what the supreme court said in their 
last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think 
its right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme vocnoise court was right or 
wrong sil its been a part of this fabric of this country for more than 
ten years and to reverse it sil would create too much sil vocnoise too many 
problems for people sil yknow which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry 
folks but yknow its too late iver right laugh iver umhum vocnoise iver sil umhum 
sil which meant shed never get the nomination because of who controls the republican party 
iver sil she was but i had admired her more sil laugh vocnoise yeah because 
um vocnoise uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again vocnoise thats 
gonna be the litmus test vocnoise and its just like back in in the sixties 
and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party vocnoise 
they would nominate such people as uh mcgovern who hadnt yknow who i voted for 
but had no chance of winning vocnoise over the years i have moderated my sil 
hardline left of center liberal stance sil vocnoise for more of a moderate vocnoise middle 
of the road sil vocnoise because its easier to get that sold to the american 
public sil vocnoise um sil vocnoise so uh vocnoise while unknownguh sil i think dole 
was correct sil um vocnoise i think she yeah she shot herself in the foot 
sil i dont she would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party 
remains the way that it is sil being controlled by the extreme right wing sil 
vocnoise which is a problem for the republicans they moved they need to move towards 
the middle vocnoise which i think george w is trying to do vocnoise vocnoise sil 
um sil uh sil uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell i tell 
them yes and im an cutoffinindifferent vocnoise uh vocnoise an indifferent liberal iver umhum iver 
laugh iver umhum iver vocnoise right sil vocnoise if she could have become the candidate 
vocnoise sil she might have been able to beat sil cutoffr hesi i think almost 
anybody can beat gore right now but yknow unknown vocnoise and in in election times 
vocnoise sil a weekend sil is a couple of centuries uh uh a year vocnoise 
sil is an sil eon lauhyknow vocnoise so anything can happen between now and then 
but vocnoise i think sil uh dole had a good chance of being elected because 
most americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate vocnoise sil uh sil 
which is basically where clinton sil placed himself in the two elections he ran in 
vocnoise um vocnoise sil most real democrats the warren beattys of the world and many 
vocnoise yknow congressmen hesand and senators dislike clinton vocnoise because hesthey cutoffdididnt they didnt think 
he was democratic enough sil vocnoise sil um sil i liked clinton because as i 
said over the years hesuh ive learned that vocnoise sil extremes in either party dont 
get elected sil vocnoise and that if you want someone sil that has your vocnoise 
sil general interest at heart you hafta find someone whos a moderate and can can 
appeal to everybody vocnoise i used to tell school districts when i went in to 
tell them how to to put together a school levy campaign that basically you had 
vocnoise the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my sil age 
vocnoise but that there was about vocnoise thirty percent of the people who were sil 
were for you sil with the yes votes thirty percent who were automatically against you 
the no votes vocnoise and thirty percent in between vocnoise i told them ignore the 
no votes sil yknow just sil just dont get them upset with you you dont 
want them yknow working actively against you vocnoise sil lock up cutoffyyour vocnoise your thirty 
that are with you make sure you sil yknow you do something with them but 
sil this group the the middle thirties i call them vocnoise sil you had to 
massage them vocnoise and thats what clinton did so well and thats what dole could 
have done im not sure if george w is gonna be able to vocnoise sil 
uh because to get the the nomination eventually hes gonna come out and have to 
make his hard statements to those people which is im anti abortion vocnoise im pro 
gun hes already said the pro gun vocnoise and thats because its going against sil 
what most americans are saying vocnoise dole i think represented where most americans are if 
you look at opinion polls vocnoise sil um so cutoffyyou yknow you hafta find a 
way to cutoffmmoderate to moderate that stance sil uh whether youre republican or a democrat 
iver vocnoise oh yeah sil i think its possible vocnoise itd have to take the 
right combination sil of uh someone who can appeal to the party people and get 
the nomination and appeal to the people vocnoise i think dole would have been a 
good candidate i would have been hard pressed vocnoise i mean uh to some of 
her issues i dont like but vocnoise when she came out vocnoise uh and said 
her her her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns 
sil uh she went up a cutoffnnotch couple of notches in in in my estimation 
because i wasnt sure where shed be vocnoise i thought shed have to sell herself 
as hardline with the hardline republicans vocnoise sil and then i wouldnt have been able 
to vote for her sil iver vocnoise iver umhum iver except you couldnt come right 
out and say you wouldnt you didnt want to vote for her because she was 
a woman thered have to be an under current iver vocnoise i think there might 
be but i think most of them are a dying breed sil theyre the older 
citizens sil um sil many in my generation uh theyd just probably be vocnoise because 
hesim im the early baby boom im im the first of the baby boom vocnoise 
uh and thats when the womans movement started and many men there still havent always 
accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the vocnoise the 
the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me vocnoise sil when i 
talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students 
vocnoise sil um sil there theres a a whole world of difference between their attitudes 
in a lot of things and vocnoise yknow womens minority issues uh they just second 
hand to them it it doesnt sil yknow sil its sil not sil like it 
was for us which was a sea change vocnoise sil for them its normal vocnoise 
so and more of those people are vocnoise sil in the voting population sil if 
they would vote sil laugh vocnoise yknow youd have to find a candidate who would 
know how to do what clinton did in ninety two and get out that college 
vote iver that that um vocnoise thats an interesting question because he was a cutoffsserious 
sil a serious contender last time i havent heard his name this time vocnoise um 
vocnoise sil vocnoise what people say they would do cutoffththat yknow that they like him 
sil because he is um intelligent charismatic vocnoise uh all those cutoffththose those neat things 
that you need to vocnoise to be elected today vocnoise sil um sil and a 
lot of people said they would vote for him but what they say in polls 
they dont know if it would translate over but yeah i think he could vocnoise 
i think the right candidate could and i think mike coleman this year vocnoise uh 
in the columbus race showed that vocnoise i mean he crossed vocnoise gender lines he 
crossed sil um sil vocnoise party lines he crossed over into all of the city 
vocnoise and winning even dorothy teaters sil precinct which surprised me sil vocnoise sil yknow 
hesandnot and not by just a little small margin i think it was two hundred 
and some votes which is pretty substantial sil vocnoise iver cutoffriright well unknown iver right 
iver yeah iver well teaters a school board member for columbus iver yeah iver laughright 
laugh laughyeah iver umhum iver vocnoise iver right laugh iver vocnoise iver vocnoise thats thats 
really hard to say um vocnoise if she was a younger woman and ran the 
campaign that she ran sil negatives dont work in columbus vocnoise columbus really does have 
a heart sil and that just doesnt play vocnoise in columbus what plays in the 
state sil and and the people who ran her campaign ran voinovichs campaign and vocnoise 
betty montgomerys campaign and and that negative stuff worked statewide vocnoise that doesnt work so 
well in columbus vocnoise um sil i i think that itd sil even a younger 
woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost vocnoise um sil and i like 
to think that age doesnt matter but she came across as old to me also 
vocnoise and i like to think im not prejudiced on sil on any issue but 
if theres uh vocnoise someone who had been right on the issues sil i dont 
care if she was old i would have voted for her she just didnt support 
the issues i supported vocnoise she was wrong on vocnoise uh i i didnt like 
that she tried to use um the police chief sil in such a negative way 
by saying that um vocnoise coleman had voted for a raise for the chief vocnoise 
well yes he voted for a raise for the chief but he voted for a 
raise for the the police sil officers sil its just that yknow the police chiefs 
was tied to his vocnoise and i dont like people who try to manipulate facts 
vocnoise uh and and that was manipulating the facts i didnt like that she was 
um vocnoise sil uh sil uh cutoffagagainst against vocnoise the the the tiff sil uh 
and polaris once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was 
right or wrong and i dont think it was wrong to begin with vocnoise but 
once it was voted and in place i thought our reputation was on the line 
and for her to try to use another divisive issue just to get elected vocnoise 
didnt sit well with me vocnoise um so i dont even if she had a 
lot of charisma vocnoise charisma doesnt mean as much to me sil as a persons 
stand on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people 
so i cant really answer that question how they would have voted vocnoise sil uh 
because i didnt think that mike coleman exactly had charisma either iver laugh vocnoise sil 
vocnoise iver his youth iver umhum sil iver right iver vocnoise and uh and thats 
really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in 
nineteen ninety two because vocnoise sil vocnoise sil i sil uh uh uh vocnoise i 
havent said it yet but unknown yknow anyone who listening to this tape or you 
would be able to know im a democrat and generally vote democratic although vocnoise ill 
tell you i sil i did vote for unknown cutoffgregreg greg lashuka once and if 
he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style 
vocnoise and he hasnt been bad for the city but vocnoise um im generally a 
democrat vocnoise sil uh and ive only voted for two people who won the presidential 
election and i knew in ninety two early on that clinton was gonna win just 
by vocnoise sil being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time 
with my girlfriend vocnoise and a waiter came up and um vocnoise he said something 
about yknow vocnoise and i cant remember how we got started on the topic sil 
yknow just taking my my order for a restaurant but he said something about um 
vocnoise sil uh dole was too old vocnoise and this was a young guy he 
was in college vocnoise sil and i knew there was there was a cutoffssort a 
cutoffssort a sort of a shift vocnoise people wanted someone vocnoise sil with younger ideas 
sil and um vocnoise a new vision they didnt want the world war two vision 
anymore vocnoise sil uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because 
by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought vocnoise do they 
really understand the difference sil in vocnoise sil vocnoise issues sil and what the two 
stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clinton 
vocnoise so i think for the average voter that does have a vocnoise a lot 
of sway iver vocnoise im not sure yet sil um sil vocnoise at least based 
on money raised it looks like george w could trample almost anybody sil vocnoise but 
george w hasnt gotten out there in the fray yet and given too many answers 
to sil issues vocnoise he talks about compassionate conservativism and i dont know what that 
means vocnoise yknow i i want answers to specific questions as to what does compassionate 
conservative mean but vocnoise i dont think that im sil uh sil average in that 
i dont go for the the the slick image cutoffjjust bothers me vocnoise um he 
has the potential of cutoffchtrampling of trampling gore i think that gore will be the 
the nominee no matter what bradley does gore has it sewn up because hes the 
insider vocnoise um vocnoise at iver sil iver yeah i cutoffthithink uh i think theyre 
both boring vocnoise if you look at the the image thing vocnoise theyre both fairly 
wooden neither one of them seems comfortable in front of a camera vocnoise sil uh 
its interesting on sil on bradley vocnoise sil my boyfriend is is big in sports 
sil hes hes vocnoise sil not as liberal as i am hes a little bit 
on the conservative side vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise and he but he would support 
bradley simply because he was a cutoffbbasketball vocnoise a a former uh basketball player vocnoise 
and im about ready to say to him at some point in time yknow if 
he becomes president hes youre gonna hate him because he has all of these big 
government things and youre against big government vocnoise sil um so i dont think people 
always always see that but vocnoise sil um between gore and bradley i dont see 
much difference quite frankly bradleys the more liberal sil vocnoise um sil vocnoise gore i 
think understands the need to compromise but i think gore will be the sil the 
candidate i dont think bradley will be able to go past sil all of the 
work that gores been doing for eight years as vice president iver well see thats 
not proved out by the sil the approval ratings he still has sil higher approval 
rating than reagan had in his last eighteen months so yknow people still like what 
he what hes done vocnoise i think that that sil um that yknow people dont 
like all the crap that went with him as the errorpundintspundits on tv vocnoise sil 
yknow extthey say that and theyre theyre still trying to get him sil vocnoise i 
mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him vocnoise sil which 
is what they would have done extto elizabeth dole vocnoise they wouldnt have been able 
to attack sil on the issues so theyd find other things to get sil get 
her on so they start bringing out all these women and all that stuff on 
vocnoise sil and vocnoise sil most people didnt care about it sil they didnt care 
about it before the election they didnt care about it sil during his campaign they 
didnt care about it during his presidency vocnoise it extwas sil extsome sil republican right 
wing sil i dont know what who were just trying to make an issue out 
of nothing it was not watergate vocnoise sil yknow he may have been a extcad 
yknow he may have sil yknow but vocnoise she was twentyone its not like it 
was someone who couldnt make up her own mind what she wanted to do vocnoise 
yknow and he may have been stupid and a cad uh but i dont wanna 
know about it sil vocnoise sil on day one when it hit the the news 
vocnoise sil i didnt want to know about it sil vocnoise and on the end 
when he was sil yknow not impeached sil i didnt wanna know about it sil 
vocnoise and in between i didnt wanna know about it and they just kept sil 
angering me because there were other things i wanted sil vocnoise sil the government to 
do sil vocnoise and this congress is the worst ive ever seen in not getting 
anything done and not really being able to vocnoise be on the extpulse of of 
where america is on such issues as gun control and womens rights and and things 
that are important to people vocnoise sil yknow vocnoise they theyve tried to make pseudo 
issues out of clinton and then they tried to make a pseudo issue out of 
yknow giving a tax cut vocnoise people dont want a tax cut when its going 
to affect their social security or affect sil yknow vocnoise sil uh the the the 
deficit iver yknow to get a a four or five dollar a extyear tax cut 
iver when theyre giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone whos 
making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i dont care if i get five dollars 
that wont even buy me a tank of gas today vocnoise keep the money vocnoise 
sil and do something good with it iver so um sil vocnoise i dont know 
vocnoise iver umhum iver yknow vocnoise sil even republicans are like that iver uh i 
have a friend in new jersey or two friends vocnoise sil uh a married couple 
shes a cutoffdedemocrat a lifelong democrat hes been a lifelong republican vocnoise sil uh and 
theres always interesting discussions when um when i go to visit and i went to 
visit them vocnoise few weeks before clinton was formally impeached last year vocnoise and i 
just decided i wasnt gonna bring it up iver vocnoise sil uh and id been 
there three four days and finally at breakfast one morning henry said well you havent 
talked about clinton and the impeachment yet and i said henry sil vocnoise because hes 
the republican i said vocnoise i dont even wanna go there sil let i said 
i dont even think we we wanna get involved in that conversation he says well 
he says i can understand you saying that but i thought youd yknow i wanna 
tell you where i am sil vocnoise he said when this whole thing started vocnoise 
sil i sat down and wrote sil every one of my vocnoise sil um new 
jersey representatives sil all of my senators and all of the congress people in new 
jersey vocnoise sil and told them that i will never sil ever in my life 
sil vote republican again sil because of the way this has has played out sil 
vocnoise sil i mean and this was a republican a lifelong republican he says i 
will sil always now vote democrat because this was just so stupid and such a 
waste of my my time vocnoise the countrys time vocnoise the countrys money vocnoise sil 
uh when there are better things to be dealing with and a lot of republicans 
felt that way you errorradhad to be really extreme right wing vocnoise to feel other 
than that sil vocnoise except here in central ohio sil laugh iver umhum vocnoise sil 
right iver umhum iver laugh iver right iver laugh laughyeah iver vocnoise iver right iver 
doesnt even iver right iver i know iver i wouldnt iver vocnoise i vocnoise sil 
i iver there generally tends be at least one or two republicans i vote for 
each sil erroreateach sil each election now sometimes i voted straight democrat because i extjust 
yknow i even voted for dorothy teater the first time she ran for county commissioner 
vocnoise sil uh because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and 
and i liked what she was saying but then her votes sil vocnoise later on 
and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i cutoffddidnt i 
didnt vote for her after that vocnoise but the first time she ran for county 
commissioner vocnoise i did it one because she was a woman and i like yknow 
i i when possible i like to vote for women sil vocnoise if they hold 
yknow enough of my views sil im not gonna vote for a woman sil just 
because theyre a woman sil and im not gonna vote for a democrat just because 
theyre a democrat sil they better have unknown uh yknow at least and cutoffii and 
i dont need a hundred percent sil uh so that a agreement with my views 
but id like theyd be at in the ninety to ninety five percent range sil 
um but sil yeah uh ill uh i dont tend to vote straight party line 
either sil as i said ive ive moderated from when i was sil uh sil 
in vocnoise college sil to today part of the the aging process and sil also 
partly because sil ive sil ive noticed that to get things done you hafta have 
a center sil and its the center that tends to rule sil when i was 
in college sil um sil we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it 
or forget it sil and some of the construction people in dayton came out with 
one that said america love it or leave it sil uh and today i realize 
that both of those positions are wrong its america love it sil and fix it 
just like with your kids you love your kids but you dont let them sil 
yknow have bad manners at the table and you dont let them run around with 
the wrong yknow kids and you want them to behave well sil yknow thats how 
i see america now and sil and americas become more centrist sil uh and when 
it sil deviates from that either way thats when people become upset sil um sil 
so i just think its important and i sil i remember when um vocnoise who 
was the other president that i voted for that won vocnoise carter sil uh sil 
black leaders would meet with him once a week and then theyd come out and 
hold this press conference and complain about he didnt do this for blacks and he 
didnt do cutoffththat enough for blacks he didnt do this and he didnt do that 
sil and i used to say cutoffsosome to some my black friends vocnoise dont you 
see what youre doing dont you see that greater implications of this sil oh no 
we need to have him move faster i said sil yknow thatd be great sil 
in an ideal world this isnt an ideal world sil you hafta take it a 
step at a time whether you like it or not sil sil i said what 
youre gonna do is youre gonna make it look like he is so bad in 
all the issues youre gonna give people a reason to vote against him vocnoise then 
if any big issue comes up vocnoise thats just gonna be added to everything else 
sil i said what you need to do is after you have this meeting with 
him is come out and praise him and that hes doing a good job and 
that were moving along steadily sil uh and i yknow i dont think sometimes people 
who do politics of the negative understand what it means sil um i made that 
mistake when i was president the dayton education association we were trying to get a 
levy passed sil so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions 
in the school all the leaking cutoffwwalls yknow sil uh ceilings all of the peeling 
floors all the the bad chalk boards with cracks in them and all that kind 
of stuff sil and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought 
the schools were so bad they said were not gonna support those sil and they 
voted no sil so the next time we did an opposite track we went in 
and we said yknow um the vocnoise eighteen months later when the board put erroranoderanother 
um sil cutoffbalbalance sil uh cutoffvvote sil levy on the the ballot sil we said 
these are great schools we have great teachers look at this kid hes learning to 
read hes made six months improvement in three months and all that kind sil cutoffimaimage 
it was sil image sil and it we were saying the same thing yknow we 
want to continue this we want to make even this better sil um sil we 
learned to say the negatives in a positive way and thats important sil yknow and 
and you need to get that cutoffccenter that sil cutoffyyou you need to appeal to 
the center sil americans dont like extreme sil liberals they dont like extreme conservatives sil 
yknow cutoffththey they want sil they want peace laugh iver umhum iver right iver i 
think its the right sil position to take sil um but it sil it like 
abortion thats one of the the big cutoffiissues sil issues that divide people very quickly 
sil uh i think its moderating somewhat sil uh as the gay activists continue their 
campaigns sil um but thats one where a candidate has to tread very carefully sil 
um i was proud that coleman said it and didnt sil and didnt back down 
on that sil um they sil told me a little bit about his character sil 
um sil i dont know that i can answer your question straight forward because sil 
i believe in gay cutoffrirights sil i believe in anybodys rights sil unknownidontknow sil what 
happens between consenting adults in a bedroom is their business not mine iver excluderight vocnoise 
iver umhum vocnoise iver vocnoise not if hed been as open about it cutoffaas as 
he was here sil um sil yknow clinton did that also and and thought hed 
be able to sil um sil cutoffsegresegregate or not segregate desegregate the uh the the 
military and found out with his first sil action sil as president that sil there 
theres a strong backlash against that at least nation wide and and and in the 
military vocnoise but i thought it was the right stance sil um iver because its 
more open sil um sil and you couch it in terms of civil rights sil 
um sil my boyfriends sil thinks its wrong morally sil but doesnt think we ought 
to be discriminating against sil uh he he thinks its a sin vocnoise therefore he 
thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through yknow talking to 
them religion wise sil um sil i dont think its a sin i think that 
sil um your sexuality sil is genetic based sil and that sil i sil you 
can no more change sil your sexual orientation than you can the color of your 
eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put 
a different sil um sil whatever those vocnoise eye cutoffppieces pieces are sil contacts sil 
i dont wear glasses so i can never remember those terms sil um vocnoise but 
thats just cosmetic sil sil and anyone who tries to change their sexual orientation thats 
cosmetic too sil uh sil and again unknownwhyuh my belief is whatever happens between consenting 
adults is their business not mine sil um sil so i dont know that sil 
anyone could change it unknown sil what was your question again iver why people iver 
because of the gay activism iver umhum iver yeah i was gonna say most them 
are iver i think so because i unknown sil i iver when sil in the 
fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people sil on t v and then 
you start seeing a couple of black people on t v and then there was 
the jeffersons and although i found that jeffersons offensive in many ways because it was 
stereotypical and sil made fun of of of black people sil in many ways in 
retrospect sil it was trend setting sil and what it did in in even in 
putting blacks sil in sil um sil advertisements on t v sil young kids saw 
them sil uh cutoffaand and saw those ads and saw those t v programs sil 
and so it became sil uh sil a part of everyday life sil cutoffaand and 
vocnoise the more you see something the more it cutoffbebecomes vocnoise becomes more acceptable sil 
so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now well look back 
on those t v programs and vocnoise think they were trend setting instead of stereotypical 
sil um sil but it im sure it does have uh sil some influence because 
sil i think it did sil cutoffiit it wasnt sil the sil only thing that 
had an influence sil but it was one of the little unknown sil pieces sil 
of the puzzle that that helps sil i think matthew shepherd helped sil also iver 
vocnoise not in my lifetime sil hed hafta cutoffbbe sil probably be a closet gay 
i mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military sil and 
just as long as people dont know that they dont feel threatened sil see cutoffaand 
and and i cutoffhahave i uh i cutoffddont i dont understand that mindset i really 
dont i dont know why sil uh a man feels threatened by a having gay 
near them sil um vocnoise i have a couple of gay friends and and one 
of my friends always says um sil yknow does sil every man like every woman 
he sees is he attracted to every woman and yknow want to go to bed 
with every woman sil yknow what makes a man think that just because im gay 
vocnoise i might be interested in him yknow thats the height of arrogance sil um 
yknow but but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened 
by lesbians i dont know but sil its not a mindset i have so its 
hard for me to understand iver laughwellyeah iver laugh iver vocnoiseumhum iver laugh iver vocnoiseitmightbe 
iver right iver yeah i dont understand it i really have a hard time understanding 
yknow vocnoise theyre not after you sil they just want to live a life iver 
umhum iver yeah vocnoise iver laugh iver umhum sil vocnoise iver hm iver umhum iver 
vocnoise i bet you have laugh you just vocnoisedidntknowit laugh iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver 
vocnoise iver im not sure where my father would have been and my father was 
very liberal sil vocnoise sil uh more so even than my mother sil vocnoise sil 
um sil vocnoise sil because if its not something thats part of your culture every 
day sil vocnoise sil yknow and and youve been told its wrong and the catholic 
church said it was wrong as errormotsmost sil most religions do vocnoise im sure he 
wouldve sil vocnoise sil yknow had some sil concern but i think his his vocnoise 
intellect sil would eventually have worked it out especially if you sat down and talked 
with him sil vocnoise sil and he wouldnt have done yknow there wouldnt have been 
any gay bashing with him and vocnoise um sil vocnoise there wouldnt have been sil 
yknow what happened yknow to the the black man in jasper texas and the yknow 
sil vocnoise sil uh the unknown the shepard boy in in vocnoise what was that 
oklahoma sil uh yknow he wouldnt of iver yeah iver hate crime is a is 
an sil is an sil interesting sil term sil um sil vocnoise all crimes all 
murders sil are hate related i uh sil im not sure vocnoise sil it thats 
sil uh it its difficult i sil we had civil rights laws many people were 
opposed to those but vocnoise sil it was uh in an effort to correct sil 
years vocnoise of sil institutionalized racism sil vocnoise sil um sil cutoffaand and and maybe 
something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate vocnoise but sil a 
crime is a crime and yknow are you going to give someone who murdered matthew 
shepard sil vocnoise sil six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else 
one life term i mean murder is murder vocnoise and theres already a a law 
on the books so i dont think we need to have sil a hate crime 
sil over and above that sil vocnoise sil yknow vocnoise sil uh vocnoise the cutoffththe 
cutoffthethe the people who murdered matthew shepard sil should be tried and hopefully vocnoise convicted 
on the facts vocnoise and shouldnt have anything else added into it vocnoise sil i 
sil i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many 
of the civil rights and the sil vocnoise sil uh affirmative action programs and the 
busing did to people its going to turn people against sil uh unknown gays like 
it turned people against blacks for a while although sil ultimately i think it did 
make a difference vocnoise i cutoffhahad sil i had a sil vocnoise i have a 
black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties sil 
vocnoise sil in uh opening up restaurants in the south sil and sil vocnoise sil 
marching and yknow going to yknow opening the schools in the south sil and vocnoise 
i said to her one day are you disappointed that sil things arent better vocnoise 
sil uh yknow that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and 
she said no she said that wasnt my goal sil vocnoise sil my goal wasnt 
to change hearts and minds sil vocnoise sil my goal was to change behavior sil 
vocnoise and the behavior changed sil vocnoise except now sil i never thought i would 
live to see an vocnoise all white jury sil convict white men sil vocnoise of 
errorcomcommitting of killing a black man sil were in hearts and minds now sil iver 
umhum sil vocnoise an all white jury sil iver vocnoiseconvicted two white men and the 
third ones on trial now be interesting to see what happens to him because he 
says he didnt have that big a role in it iver right iver vocnoise iver 
cutoffaand iver umhum sil vocnoise yeah but vocnoise but but many people sil especially its 
a kid that young sil may not know what that really means sil vocnoise and 
may its to be part of the group and part of the yknow be cool 
may go along with it when really they dont like it i dont i havent 
made up my mind about him whether hes telling the truth or whether he hasnt 
sil or whether he wasnt sil vocnoise iver vocnoise well yeah me either vocnoise iver 
vocnoise yeah iver vocnoise but ive been in situations sil where people have told racist 
jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick sil vocnoise 
the time to to challenge someone very carefully vocnoise but in other situations ive said 
sil i dont find those types of jokes funny please dont tell them anymore sil 
vocnoise sil in my presence sil do what you want when youre with your other 
friends but dont do it in front of me vocnoise sil i dont even like 
blonde jokes i find those sil sexist and um sil racist in a way sil 
and i cutoffddont i cutoffwwhen no one will tell them to me one day when 
sil i was still working in an office there were telling fifteen or twenty of 
them in a row and vocnoise i just kept a stone face but at one 
or two i did laughkindofsmile but they were trying to get me to laugh but 
i wouldnt sil vocnoise sil but um iver right you gotta pick your battles right 
iver yep vocnoise iver umhum iver umhum iver right iver laughyeah laugh iver laugh iver 
right sil or maybe it will sil sil yes sil um sil vocnoise well sil 
i was raised sil most of my life in ashland sil its about sil ten

its its in a t shape and then the side of the building sil all 
the sound just rolls right up the wall sil and vocnoise this trash truck made 
so much stinking noise sil its ridiculous sil every single morning at two thirty sil

ability to sleep through anything sil which is sil and thats thats so one of 
the fascinating things when i go home sil dead silence sil dead sil silence sil 
and that sil is now where i have a problem sleeping sil because its because 
theres no noise sil theres no noise im so used to like turning my radio 
on and drowning out all the background sound sil that i hafta like have music

show coming in or not sil but thats the place i really like going sil 
um sil they uh sil theyre open till usually two thirty sil two oclock sil 
all depends sil um sil i also found something fascinating sil um sil i uh 
sil came to columbus and sil yknow raised in this really really really conservative extremely 
christian religious community of ashland sil and i came to columbus and i started meeting 
sil yknow i started meeting the extremely taboo group of homosexuals sil and i have 
found some the most fascinating people on this planet are homosexuals sil um sil and 
theyre not nearly the theyre not the the the sil evil people that that everybody 
back home in our community always said they were yknow its just like these are 
normal people sil yknow i may not agree with what theyre doing but sil theyre 
normal people sil and ive met some really cool people sil who are sil who 
are homosexuals and that leading sil where that was going was um sil we went 
to axis which is sil uh one of the home sil well sil its one 
of the gay um sil uh dance clubs in columbus sil its um sil its 
on high street its down in uh sil its down in the german cutoffvillvillage sil 
no its not all the way sil is it the short north sil its in 
the short north sil but um sil vocnoise its so much fun vocnoise its absolutely 
so much fun because sil its really weird vocnoise um sil you normally dont get 
hit on by girls vocnoise when you go to a regular dance club sil but 
when you go to axis you dont get hit on by girls you get hit 
on by guys sil i danced with glow sticks and ive had i had like 
seven guys come up to me in one night and theyre just like can can 
you like sil can you do that for me excludeanyway iver because apparently they sil 
apparently they get really fascinated by sil the fact that the lights are moving around 
right in front of them so i do that for i do it right in 
front of their face and theyd be like dude that excludedudethatthanks iver sil and apparently 
thats a way of errorinishinginitiating a conversation sil um one of the guys that i 
usually go clubbing with hes the one that got me into the glow stick dancing 
and he said uh sil he said its like a sign that says excludecome hit 
on me and im like oh great thats thats just what i need sil no 
it doesnt bother me sil doesnt bother me sil i just vocnoise i just vocnoise 
sil i sort of just im just like not yknow im straight sil if they 
start sil if they start getting really vocnoise yknow really pushy about it im just 
like im straight sil but a lot of times its really funny because ill get 
in a conversation with em and theyll be like sil youre straight arent you sil 
im like yeah sil theyll sil yeah they sil i dont know how but they 
must sil they sil its just being sil i must guess it must be the 
way i talk or sil or or something but sil i think i keep a 
lot of them away because i do a lot of really sil i do a 
lot of really robust movements sil with my glow sticks im like flailing about and 
sil yknow its like this unknown i got this wide berth around me sil yeah 
its its not one of these its one of these and yeah its sil yeah 
sil umhum sil hum sil yeah sil vocnoise iver yeah sil i guess im just 
so secure about who i am that i dont have a problem with it sil 
and i was in the mens glee club for a while so sil theres a 
small percentage of the people in there that are sil yknow that cutoffaare sil that 
are gay as well and thats and and sil i really made friends with a 
lot of them sil i guess uh i mean sil i guess its just because 
of my personality i i cutoffrereally i really dont know what it is but apparently 
something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey sil you can 
be my friend im cool sil im all right even though im not even though 
im not one of you i can still be your friend sil which is sort 
of what i try and emanate because im im very very religious sil and its 
vocnoise the sil christian community is very sil is sil im not gonna say can 
be i say they sil are sil christian community is very very mean towards sil 
homosexuals sil and cutoffsso sil thats just not right i mean theyre people sil theyre 
making a mistake in in my eyes yes but that doesnt mean im going look 
at them any differently sil as human beings sil they deserve my respect sil oh 
yeah but i see everyone as engaging in sinful behavior because sil in my in 
my religion everyone sins sil um vocnoise im a vocnoise im a christian i go 
to a non denominational church sil yeah sil vocnoise i dont like denominations sil im 
not iver im not real big on the denominations because i think that vocnoise i 
think thats sort of goes against sil what the original intent of of vocnoise unknownthe 
unknowngod christianity vocnoise was i vocnoise i mean sil it was designed to be a 
unifying sil religion sil and the denominations there are just vocnoise are are just vocnoise 
yeah but if unknown sil i dont like them laugh iver umhum iver umhum sil 
yeah iver umhum sil yep iver not really i mean sil i have i sil 
i vocnoise theres theological differences that i have sil um iver excludeyeah without going into 
too much detail sil um vocnoise one of my best friends from high school sil 
well he stayed at home vocnoise and i went off to columbus and i found 
an amazing church down here and learned sil a lot sil and sil and sil 
really stumbled across a lot of interesting doctrine sil and theological beliefs and sil i 
believe that stuff now sil and he doesnt sil and he feels actually strongly that 
sil anyone who believes that is like sil vocnoise sil a heretic sil and sil 
he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours sil and before he 
left for alaska i actually sil took the time to to uh sil i didnt 
want to vocnoise but sil he was sort of pushing me into it sil because 
we were sil iming each other sil and uh sil he sort of pushed me 
into it a little bit and sil i told him vocnoise yknow im like sil 
a lot of the stuff that you have talked about sil uh yknow vocnoise talked 
about not liking i believe sil and i cutoffsaisaid sil and i told him i 
said i can sil i can understand sil if sil in our minds theres a 
problem sil but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong and leave 
it at that sil but thats not what youre thinking youre thinking youre looking at 
me and youre knowing sil within your mind hes evil hes wrong sil and i 
said thats not right dude sil excludeyeah sil i sil i honestly dont know sil 
uh people get really scared sil theres certain i mean like cutoffiits theres certain denominations 
that will take one sil its sort of like the outer limits theyll take one 
sil book sil or one scripture sil out of the bible sil and expand it 
to crystal sil clarity sil and sil theyll just run with it sil and thats 
what my mom came out of sil um sil her sil her denomination that she 
came out of shes not part of it any more sil denomination she came out 
of it sil um sil some of the more sil devout sil churches within the 
apostolic christian church sil were talking men sit on one side women sit on the 
other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry sil the sermon is read 
in three different languages sil some really wacky stuff iver i mean some really wacky 
iver sil excludeyeah sil theyll just take one scripture and theyll expand it sil um 
vocnoise and and theyll just vocnoise run with that one scripture sil and then there 
are also churches that will just sil deletes and theyll cutoffddo sil in the sil 
in cutoffmimind in their minds theyll delete certain sections of the scripture that they dont 
like sil first corinthians chapter twelve talks about vocnoise sil um spiritual gifts sil and 
thats one of the big things that im into sil down here in columbus and 
the fact that they still exist sil like sil healing people and sil spiritual gifts 
like healing people and and um sil vocnoise the extremely taboo sil um religious topic 
sil among sil a lot of churches is the gift of tongues sil whether its 
dead whether its not sil whether its inspired whether its not inspired sil yadda yadda 
blah blah sil well sil i hadnt even heard about it until i got to 
columbus because sil and and i know the bible pretty well sil and sil i 
hadnt even heard about it until i got to columbus and i get to columbus 
and im like sil okay this is pretty cool sil i went home and im 
talking to some people in my parents church and sil theyre like sil oh yeah 
sil um we just dont really talk about that very often and im just iver 
sil why i mean its part of the scripture that you say you believe in 
a hundred percent then why dont you vocnoise why dont you talk about it sil 
and the problem is that sil they dont vocnoise they dont know the answer sil 
sil and if they dont know the answer if they cant give a firm sil 
this is the answer then they avoid it sil excli try and find it vocnoise 
i try and find vocnoise for me sil what has become the best answer sil 
yknow if i dont sil if i dont cutoffbelbelieve sil if i dont believe something 
or i dont know sil what to believe about something sil ill go and ill 
find an answer for myself sil im not gonna take somebody elses answer sil and 
if i do take someone elses answer they better be able to back it up 
sil yknow sil yeah sil yeah sil yeah sil yeah sil well i know a 
lot of people that do sil but i know a lot of people that dont 
sil umhum sil umhum sil um do the theological discussions no vocnoise no unless sil 
unless youre seeking that out i mean sil i go to the vineyard church its 
up in its up in uh sil um westerville sil and theres about sil vocnoise 
theres about probably six thousand of us sil its one the biggest churches in ohio 
sil and um sil but if you want to find something in that church you 
can find it you can find a discussion group about anything sil its just a 
matter of finding it sil and sil within any vocnoise within any cutoffddenomination sil denomination 
or within any religion sil you go as deep as you want to go sil 
yknow there are people thatd just go on sunday mornings there are people who just 
go on easter there are people who sil go monday wednesday tuesday sil and then 
sunday nights and saturday nights and sil are very very very sil into that sil 
and i mean sil im not the monday tuesday wednesday thursday type sil but i 
am pretty involved sil im pretty involved sil umhum sil the community sil the community 
sil um the church is designed as a community of other christians sil its not 
necessarily designed as sil um sil vocnoise i heard this in a sermon this is 
really good sil um its not designed as the congregation comes in and says way 
to go pastor you go do it were gonna cheer you on sil the job 
of a christian is to go out and spread the gospel of jesus christ sil 
thats the job sil of a christian sil and sil there are a lot of 
churches who have totally forgotten sil that thats what the original vocnoise yknow thats what 
the thats what a christians supposed to do sil and thats what our church does 
sil sil we try and vocnoise yknow we try and sil and teach and sil 
expand peoples knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about 
christ sil they dont have sil yknow they dont have that blank look on their 
face when the person asks them something sil yknow they sil somebody asks them something 
and theyre like yknow sil i dont know sil or they sil actually have an 
answer vocnoise yknow sil cutoffiif sil if sil cutoffiif sil and if they dont know 
theyll say sil i dont know but i can find out for you if youre 
willing to sil if youre willing to give me the time to go find out 
sil i dont know the hardest iver sil um iver some of the really hard 
questions sil um why do bad things happen to good people sil people cant cutoffjjust 
people cant just accept that sil that sil bad things happen to good people they 
want to know why sil i dont know why sil im not i cutoffmemean unknown 
i mean yeah i have a personal relationship with my sil with my god but 
were not on yknow were not on a conversational im on this side of the 
table youre on that side the table why did this happen sil and he doesnt 
sil he doesnt see fit to tell me why something happens sil unless it pertains 
to me sil um sil vocnoise lets see whats another really hard one um sil 
one of the biggest ones with people sil my age sil is the cutoffde sil 
is um sil apologetics sil uh cutoffver sil apologetics which is sil going out and 
saying sil youre a sinner sil accept christ sil everybody on this campus has heard 
of brother jedd sil he runs around on cutoffcamcampus he runs around on the oval 
going yknow slut whore vocnoise yadda yadda yadda sil and thats just sil cutoffthethere i 
mean there are a lot of sil there are a lot of people within the 
community of sil of christians who sil cant stand that sil we dont like what 
hes doing sil because vocnoise yeah im one of them because vocnoise we have to 
go back sil anyone who has been influenced by him we have to go back 
and we have to sil undo all the damage hes done before we can really 
start in on them sil and and unknown sil and helping them to understand what 
were trying to tell them sil we have to undo what brother jedd has done 
because sil hes just sil i mean yeah maybe his hearts sil in the right 
place but hes doing it the wrong way sil but um sil one of the 
big sil things sil is sil right after youre done cutoffsspeaking sil doing all of 
the sil spiel about yknow why you think they should cutoffacaccept sil accept christ sil 
in their life they say okay thats good for you sil and thats sil the 
general vocnoise thats the general feeling among people our age sil our generation vocnoise i 
mean sil i mean what generation are we anyways sil im im cutofftwetwenty im twenty 
sil so theres like sil the generation sil x theyre the generation sil right sil 
after me and theres generation y two k theyre generation right before me so were 
stuck right in the middle sil dont even think we have a generation iver sil 
laugh just one big iver sil yeah sil yeah sil yeah sil i dont feel 
that i sil i dont feel i i dont feel like i fit in with 
the teenagers anymore either sil umhum sil laugh iver yeah sil laugh sil cant really 
take her with you laugh sil yeah you cant get her in laugh you cant 
get her in sil have to be eighteen to get into dance clubs now sil 
but um sil thats uh sil those are the two really really really tough ones 
that sil a lot of people will sil uh will will throw at you when 
youre when youre trying to share things with them sil but theres vocnoise i mean 
theres whole theres whole lists of them sil and uh sil its just a matter 
of sil i mean sil i sil i dont cutoffknknow sil i am vocnoise sil 
getting myself to a point where i can go out sil and share my faith 
with other people sil i dont think im ready to sil um sil because sil 
one of the biggest problems is like i mentioned with sil with the brother jedd 
thing sil is sil undoing the damage other people have done sil and sil i 
dont have enough knowledge sil up here sil to really go out sil and sil 
and yknow sil to go out and be like a campus preacher sil i mean 
sil i will tell sil i will share my faith with people that im really 
close to sil that like sil yknow coemployees and other sil and other thing and 
other people that im in like sil if somebody and i sil if somebody gets 
real close to me in a class yknow eventually ill share sil and eventually ill 
share with them but sil like if im in a lecture hall im not gonna 
jump up and start hollering about my faith sil um sil and sil and i 
wont sil i wont walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends 
will and sit down and start talking to people sil i dont feel im ready 
to do that yet sil i think there are cutoffplaplaces i think theres a place 
and a time sil for doing certain things sil like um sil vocnoise sil and 
this is sil this is one of the biggest um sil things that people use 
as vocnoise as a reason for sil faith sil faith sil is something that people 
dont understand sil i dont even understand it sil i use it as sil i 
use it as an answer for a lot of questions that i dont have sil 
answers for sil is faith sil and thats what religion is religion is faith sil 
every religion has vocnoise hasta have faith you hafta believe that what youre doing and 
what youre believing in is right sil yknow vocnoise whether sil everyone else in the 
world thinks it is or not you hafta believe it is sil or sil you 
being sil or you being part of that religion has sil absolutely no meaning sil 
and sil thats an answer that a lot of people dont like to hear sil 
and sil yknow like sil um sil ive walked down sil like high street before 
sil and gotten this sil urge this feeling to just share my faith with certain 
people on the cutoffsstreet sil on the sidewalks sil like i share sil i shared 
my faith cutofffefew uh vocnoise a little while ago with sil some street bums sil 
and sil they were real receptive sil and i dont know if they were drunk 
sil but they were real receptive sil i mean i i dont know if they 
really understood what i was saying but sil i felt sil led to talk to 
them sil and thats what i believe my faith is my faith is sil is 
faith sil its noise believing that sil things happen that you cant explain sil and 
theres sil its sil believing that uh youre doing sil what youre doing is right 
sil so sil religions a real big part of my life iver i knew we 
sil i knew we wouldnt go into this errortonversationconversation too far before this vocnoise before 
it came in sil laugh sil umhum sil laugh sil yeah sil it has sil 
it has sil yeah sil exactly what you said sil i mean sil my dad 
my whole family are christians and before i left for college my freshman year my 
dad vocnoise my dad knows me real well mainly because im doing almost a mirror 
image of what he did when he grew up sil uh sil aside from vocnoise 
the faith that i have sil um im very much like him sil um sil 
he wrote out a list of seven things errorsevemseven predictions for williams freshman year vocnoise 
and every single one of them was accurate sil it was really really really funny 
sil william will lose something expensive by the end of the year and sil had 
my bike stolen sil william will sil william will sil cutoffhihis vocnoise and the big 
one that i vocnoise was gonna mention was sil william will either grow in his 
faith significantly sil or will go the exact opposite direction sil and sil i knew 
one or the other would happen because im the cutofftytype sil i mean sil my 
roommate sil my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer sil oh 
yeah it was real fun sil real fun i discreetly got him kicked out of 
the dorm sil he still doesnt know it was me vocnoise but laugh sil yeah 
laugh he still doesnt know it was me but he and i are still on 
speaking terms which is sil which is vocnoise fascinating sil um sil but uh sil 
yknow i mean sil our first day sil i walked in sil he said hey 
im tom you ever smoked pot before sil i was like sil no sil he 
said heck we got a whole year together sil and sil and im directly quoting 
that this the first thing he said to me sil that is the first thing 
he said to me sil no no hes not but um sil he sil and 
i sil uh he and i hung out a lot and sil yknow sil i 
sil knew that one of two things was going happen i was gonna follow him 
sil and start doing all sorts of interesting and wrong things within my own mind 
doing them sil every time i doing sil every time i would have done them 
i would have known they were wrong sil or i was going to the opposite 
direction vocnoise and i went the opposite direction i got plugged in with uh the 
vocnoise some christian groups on campus made some sil christian friends and sil hung out 
with them and and sil grew a lot sil grew a lot in acceptance of 
other people sil i mean sil you dont really run into homosexuals in a small 
rural vocnoise christian community vocnoise and if you do they sil if you do you 
dont know it because theyll errorbegetbecomeget shunned out of the community so fast that sil 
its crazy sil vocnoise sil but uh sil um sil where was i going with 
that sil okay sil sil yeah sil it was because i got sil it was 
because i got into a different sil i mean sil i had grown up sil 
with these people sil yknow i hung out with all these people that were part 
of my youth group and sil and i hung out with them and hung out 
with them and sil and sil i came to columbus and met a whole new 
group of people sil mean every year ive been down here ive met another sil 
yknow sil thousand people sil and theyre all different sil every year theyre sil all 
different people sil and that didnt happen back home i keep meeting people and its 
just really fascinating sil yeah sil this is sil endless flow of people and youre 
like wow sil and man there get some weird looking people down here sil man 
theres some good looking chicks down here in columbus sil let me tell you sil 
laugh sil um yeah my freshman year i went out with uh someone her name 
was excludename sil she sil um sil vocnoise sil shes the one who really got 
me into the uh sil what we call charismatic sil um sil christianity sil the 
christianity uh sil yknow like sil the opposite of charismatic sil is sil the um 
the serious sil old time protestant church sil where they put numbers up on the 
wall and you open up your hymnal to those numbers you sing sil you stand 
up when everyone tells you stand up you sit down when everyone tells you to 
sit down sil yadda yadda sil and then sil the vocnoise protestant sil the uh 
sorry the um sil charismatic is the exact opposite of that sil when you think 
of charismatic you think of the black churches sil where theres sil all sorts of 
sil organ playing and sil yknow praise the excludepraisethelord and hands in the air and 
singing and dancing and sil people falling over and sil and shes she really introduced 
me to that sil um sil and then we dated for about three months sil 
and sil i sil both of us decided okay sil this is sil we accomplished 
what we vocnoise were supposed to accomplish in this relationship youve introduced me to something 
and ive introduced you to something and sil now were gonna go our separate ways 
and so vocnoise we separated sil and then sil vocnoise sil i found my current 
church sil and sil got plugged in there and i met someone there sil um 
sil in sil january sil of this year sil we dated for two months sil 
and then sil i got really tired of the fact that within two weeks of

of the best theological seminaries in the u s sil and its a republican errortinkthank 
cutoffthithink sil tink thank laugh sil republican think tank sil so sil aside from the 
college the town is pretty much agricultural sil i dont know why sil unknown i

sil well what id do and improve columbus sil well for one this place is 
dirty sil with crap sil its sil its just so iver sil its so dirty 
i wish theyd clean it up more sil um sil vocnoise sil uh sil when 
i first started working for the courier service sil vocnoise i really really hated one 
way streets sil but once you get the hang of it sil theyre a blessing 
sil because youre in downtown and all of a sudden ding ding ding ding ding 
ding ding you see like twelve green lights in a row sil youre just like 
sil you go as fast as you can and try and get through sil all 
of them all at the same time sil now mind you if youre doing that 
anytime during the day that wont happen because youve got cars all around you but 
at night its pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the 
middle of down town sil um sil improvements sil i would just say keep i 
would just say that man this place is dirty sil iver yeah sil i wish 
theyd clean it up more often sil vocnoise sil no sil its not sprawling out 
from where i am laugh sil i dont live in the suburbia sil area so 
sil i mean i live vocnoise sil i live right in the middle of all 
the sil houses that have been there for sixty or seventy years and im smack 
dab in the middle of all the frats and sororities on campus sil so sil 
im on sil nah sil thats fine sil spreads out fine sil i just think 
its funny sil i sil id love to get a good nice sil overhead view 
of columbus because you probably see the sil house after house after house um sil 
yknow like sil they did right in the right in the sil um fifties sil 
uh i cant remember what its called sil vocnoise sil like where sil every single 
house is a mirror image of the one right beside it sil and you get 
all these streets that are in the exact same pattern all yknow like for like 
miles and miles and miles sil but um sil no sil i think its cool 
that theyre all spreading out sil oh yeah one thing they could really do with 
columbus that ive noticed sil are sil i would say lack of noticed in any 
other city in the united states sil why in the world do they hafta work 
on sil all the roads sil all at the same time sil i dont understand 
sil they hafta to theyre working on three fifteen two seventy seventy seventy one six 
seventy sil all at the same time sil why sil vocnoise why sil i dont 
understand it sil yeah sil apparently not vocnoise not really sil laugh sil iver vocnoise 
yeah as i was teasing laughhm iver okay iver twenty eight years sil this is 
my twenty eighth year vocnoise i have two more years to go sil and i 
get to extretire vocnoise and then ill go sil retrain and probably do something else 
for another twenty years iver oh no sil no they move you around all the 
time when you errorterchteach when you teach kids with learning disabilities vocnoise they move you 
to where the population is sil rather than move the kids to you sil so 
yeah ive been in vocnoise columbus sil and worthington are the two systems ive been 
in but sil no though within those noisesystems they can move you around from school 
to school sil ive been at the same one now for sil this is my 
seventh year sil at the middle school iver its grace brethren christian middle school its 
part of worthington schools cause they annexed sil it iver i was in columbus for 
the first like six years i taught iver back in the cutoffsseventies sil early seventies 
sil and then i transferred to worthington in seventy six and ive been there ever 
since iver sil no i didnt really start out as sil a teacher i started 
out as a speech and hearing therapist vocnoise but they kept giving me these kids 
that sil i couldnt keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech 
therapy with them sil so i got interested in the hyper activity and so i 
started taking classes vocnoise about any sil kids with sil a d h d and 
stuff and vocnoise little by little first thing you know sil vocnoise sil i had 
my masters in learning disabilities sil vocnoise sil it was mostly just so i could 
sil learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the 
speech therapy and then when i found out there were so many openings in special 
ed vocnoise sil so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a 
very good background vocnoise sil for l d because sil a lot of these l 
d kids have language deficits and language problems they vocnoise sil they cant yknow like 
express themselves on paper sil or they dont sil cutoffhehear sil process things correctly sil 
auditorially so vocnoise sil its the perfect background sil to work with l d kids 
sil i didnt know i was doing that at the time but noise iver somebody 
must have been watching over me iver yeah iver yeah right i taught sil um 
sil well i was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever 
since that ive sil been in iver uhhuh sil and then when i got my 
masters vocnoise no i did it noise no i did it vocnoise during noiseum noise 
the weekends noiseand noisethe summers noise and the nights noise and took me about sil 
mm sil well i started teaching in nineteen seventy sil seventy one iver and then 
cutoffii i sil got my masters in seventy five sil so it took me four 
years that way sil no i never vocnoise i just cutoffwwas sil was smart enough 
to do it before i had kids iver well i was married but i didnt 
have any kids once erroryoureyou have kids erroryouyoure not gonna be able to do that 
kind of a schedule sil vocnoise but um sil yeah so i didnt take off 
any time sil and then when i sil got my masters i ran into an 
old friend of mine vocnoise who sil teaches in worthington and he vocnoise sil said 
oh im the special ed director up there now we need a resource room noiseteacher 
why dont you come up and interview for this position sil or that position or 
vocnoise sil when i went up and interviewed for that position got another position but 
anyway it all worked laughout vocnoise iver vocnoise well i guess id have to say 
sil i sil dont necessarily like middle school vocnoise but see when you get a 
special ed certificate youre certified kindergarten through twelfth sil vocnoise so sil i did sil 
several years in a high school sil when i was first out of college sil 
i did high school first sil then i went to elementary while sil my kids 
were in elementary sil so i could kind of keep in touch with what they 
were supposed to be learning yknow sil vocnoise and then sil six years ago i 
went to the middle school sil and ive decided that sil im too old sil 
to keep up with these kids sil not only are they sil learning disability and 
a d d but theyre middle schoolers sil and they have like hormones running rampant 
all over the outside of their bodies sil you cant tell which is the hormones 
and which is the a d d and which is the learning disability vocnoise but 
sil like i said i only have two more years to go so i guess 
i can live through noisethat iver thats not my favorite age i guess iver middle 
iver iver iver oh yeah they were more settled iver oh they do in ninth 
grade and by tenth grade and eleventh theyre vocnoise sil little more focused on the 
fact that they better get their act together because theyre gonna have to go to 
college and vocnoise this is like vocnoise sil the only life theyre gonna get yknow 
they kind of get that realization they start getting serious vocnoise kids at middle school 
think everythings just a big joke yknow im gonna play in a rock band sil 
vocnoise sil yknow they all think theyre gonna be rock stars and drummers and vocnoise 
sil and sil yknow they could care less sil about anything it hasnt hit them 
yet this is my real life sil vocnoise sil duh sil this is my one 
real life sil better not throw it away vocnoise they waste time yknow vocnoise they 
noiselose stuff vocnoise iver they think everything they say is hilarious oh its just middle 
school i think its vocnoise transitioning from childhood vocnoise to adulthood is a tough time 
vocnoise sil and um sil when you have all the other sil things going on 
like you cant read and you cant write and you cant spell vocnoise then its 
just even worse erroriksits cutoffekexacerbated its exacerbated even more sil vocnoise sil so sil i 
get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class vocnoise iver and they 
cutoffggo iver oh sil vocnoise sil i dont really laughthink so i think of myself 
as kind of an impatient person but vocnoise sil i guess i dont sil i 
guess i dont sil i dont get as shocked by some of the things they 
do as some people do and i dont vocnoise sil yell and scream at them 
cutoffaand i mean realize they didnt ask to have a learning disability vocnoise sil i 
mean they and that they cant sil theyre not some teachers think theyre just being 
belligerent vocnoise sil and that if they wanted to straighten up they could vocnoise sil 
and what i try to tell those teachers is they cant change their learning disability 
anymore than you can change your brown eyes sil yknow they were born with it 
its genetic someone else in their family has it vocnoise they can learn they just 
dont learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into 
pieces vocnoise sil or teach it a different way its like teaching a math problem 
two different ways you get the same answer vocnoise sil but sil one way works 
better for you sil well thats how they are sil yknow maybe they dont learn 
well by listening vocnoise sil maybe they dont learn by cutoffbby well by looking vocnoise 
sil cutoffaeat sil at a chart or something sil maybe they only learn well when 
theyre up moving around doing something vocnoise sil yknow you just have to understand that 
their vocnoise avenues of learning are like different than yours sil and totally vocnoise sil 
some of them sil might be totally screwed up vocnoise sil like they might hear 
sil half of what you say sil or they might jumble up what you say 
you say cutoffppage sil turn to page three ninety three or vocnoise and they turn 
to three thirty nine in their book sil yknow and they think they did what 
you said sil vocnoise sil its just like somethings mixed up between vocnoise the actual 
eye and the ear sil and then it where it gets interpreted into the brain 
it gets all scrambled somehow vocnoise sil and i i always tell teachers if you 
could just walk sil uh vocnoise for one day in their shoes sil youd probably 
have a lot of empathy for them iver well iver cutoffnno actually in order to 
get in my room you have to vocnoise be tested by the school psychologist and 
you have to qualify as a learning disability kid vocnoise sil in other cutoffwordwords sil 
the way you qualify in the state of noiseohio is vocnoise sil you have a 
thirty point discrepancy between your actual i q sil and your daily performance in other 
words vocnoise sil lets say you have a hundred i q sil but in all 
of your classes youre performing like a seventy i q person would sil vocnoise sil 
so if theres a thirty point discrepancy in there vocnoise sil cutoffaeand and sil people 
see that youre bright sil cutoffaand but yet youre just not sil getting it vocnoise 
youre not able to write answers sil like you could say vocnoise sil or youre 
not able to read things sil that other seventh graders can read vocnoise that kind 
of clues us in and then the sil regular ed or somebody refers the child 
for testing sil and then if they qualify sil for help sil then we vocnoise 
yknow they go to my room for certain classes most of my kids i have 
them for reading and english iver thats not a shocking surprise sil i mean i 
rarely get a kid for math although we do have kids that are sil learning 
disabled and they dont understand math either even though its very concrete iver iver no 
cutoffmmath cutoffmmath math is just sil you can say okay heres three blocks you can 
touch them sil one sil two three take two away now theres one vocnoise i 
mean vocnoise iver yeah you cant say a noun is always gonna be orange vocnoise 
and its gonna be slippery laugh laughyknow laughwhat laughi laughmean sil language is so much 
more abstract than math and science vocnoise so the abstract areas like history and sil 
english and reading and literature thats where these kids have their problems sil vocnoise because 
their sil disability is usually rooted in sil somewhere in the languages vocnoise they either 
cant write cant read cant spell sil cant do all three sil or arent very 
good at any of them sil once in a while youll see a good speller 
sil vocnoise sil because he can remember the order in which the letters come sil 
but sil he might be a horrible reader and a horrible sil writer even though 
he can spell sil vocnoise sil yeah and his comprehension sil of the words of 
other kids his age wouldnt be sil what it should be vocnoise generally speaking my 
kids are two to four years behind sil and socially too sil i mean mostly 
a d h sil d and l d kids are emotionally immature as well sil 
vocnoise sil so like the songs that their friends are listening to sil and their 
friends are maybe ready to think about girls and theyre still sil acting like a 
fifth grader vocnoise yknow their not interested in girls and theyre still listening to music 
that younger kids would like vocnoise theyre just sil generally sil they mature a little 
slower sil takes them longer to catch up iver attention deficit hyperactive disorder iver vocnoise 
well iver actually sil you can have vocnoise sil well they cutoffmmainly usually go together 
some kids have learning disabilities without the sil a d h d and some have 
sil a d h d without the learning disability sil vocnoise and some have both 
vocnoise sil and you can have a d sil d without having the hyperactive part 
vocnoise sil you can have sil attention deficit disorder vocnoise with what they call hypo 
activity vocnoise and thats the student vocnoise that is kind of spacey and kind of 
dreamy sil vocnoise sil and they never cause any trouble vocnoise but theyre kind of 
like out of touch with reality and they are always looking out the window vocnoise 
sil and like theyre the one that says i didnt hear what what was the 
question vocnoise sil and uh sil theyre sil theyre a d d and they cant 
quite focus and cutoffsh distract sil cutoffne they cant screen out the distractions but vocnoise 
because theyre not hyper theyre not always doing this and theyre not bothering people vocnoise 
theyre kind of the vocnoise theyre the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle 
sil those are the kids that are real cooperative and theyre always smiling theyre kind 
of spaced out and daydreaming and sil and takes a long time to realize sil 
hey this kid sil cant focus vocnoise but with the kid thats all over the 
place and doing a sil vocnoise tapping this kids chair and the kid goes vocnoise 
sil make him stop tapping my chair vocnoise sil laughyknow vocnoise cutoffyiyou you can see 
right away that he cant focus because when youre he asks you for help and 
you come over to explain something to him and hes like sil all over the 
place while youre explaining hes not listening noiseyoure trying to show him something he wont 
look at it vocnoise yknow its like sil people often say sil a d d 
kids sil cant focus sil or cant sil attend to anything sil but whats really 
happening vocnoise sil is they attend to everything iver they can iver they just cant 
sil single out sil what i should attend to and what i should screen out 
vocnoise so they attend to everything errorweequally equally vocnoise the train going by out here 
the teacher talking up here vocnoise the kid over here shuffling his papers vocnoise this 
kid back noisehere noisepicking up his pencil vocnoise and so sil they get a little 
bit of everything and they dont learn anything iver sil you see sil iver noise 
iver oh iver or um iver if you read it sil to yourself out loud 
sil like if youre in a room by yourself and you read out loud do 
you remember it better sil than if you read noiseit silently sil if you hear 
yourself say the words vocnoise iver vocnoise well you have to um sil try some 
different things like put on headphones with music that doesnt have any words sil and 
try to read somewhere like iver yeah sil that blocks out sil all that uh 
cutoffssound vocnoise extraneous stuff thats trying to pull you away iver yeah sil yeah and 
you dont want to listen to any cutoffmmusic music with words because then youll start 
singing in the words and then you wont be able to read iver now how 
can you do that vocnoise yeah iver and i have kids that say i do 
better when i listen to my music honest i do misses excludename please let me 
listen to my headphones vocnoise but then they cant hear you when you say okay 
the times up stop now or whatever vocnoise sil youre going vocnoise sil vocnoise sil 
vocnoise sil poke him laugh so i dont usually let the kids listen to their 
headphones oh maybe the last week of school in june or something but vocnoise or 
maybe right around christmas time but most of the time i dont vocnoise because they 
get sil too sil out of touch with everything thats going on in the room 
vocnoise sil and i dont have a like a regular size class like ill have 
five six seven kids at a time and believe me when you got seven hyper 
active iver iver in your room vocnoise its just like forty of any other kind 
its plenty sil vocnoise iver yeah iver vocnoise oh there always has been vocnoise there 
always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids vocnoise sil a 
lot of kids are on medication today that shouldnt be sil but um sil i 
think thats the fault of the school or the parents vocnoise or some doctor that 
like for example when we errorfreferrefer kids in worthington to a doctor we have a 
list of three doctors that we work with vocnoise and we know that they wont 
just give this kid a pill if he doesnt have vocnoise sil eight out of 
the twelve symptoms or whatever sil so we refer them to those doctors and then 
sil vocnoise sil if sil this cutoffdodoctor vocnoise those doctors are pretty conservative too and 
if they put them on meds its usually just for the school day sil vocnoise 
sil not during the summer not over vacation not after five oclock sil vocnoise sil 
not on the weekends vocnoise and its just to help them focus sil and then 
sil these doctors also ask for vocnoise reports back from the teachers and if you 
dont see any appreciable difference vocnoise in two or three weeks then you take the 
kid off and you try something else vocnoise and some kids medication is like the 
difference between night and day you go back in observe the kid you cant believe 
its the same kid vocnoise other kids sil doesnt phase them they might as well 
be drinking a glass of water vocnoise sil well sil since they have side effects 
like they stunt your growth and they vocnoise subdue your appetite and some of the 
other sil yknow some kids get headaches from dexadrine and aderal vocnoise sil so i 
say yknow if it works use it if it sil if it doesnt work just 
forget it vocnoise but sil yknow a lot of sil people feel that too many 
kids are on this stuff because vocnoise sil there may be just sil not able 
to pay attention a little bit but theyre not really a d d vocnoise sil 
and the parents are taking them in and going vocnoise johnnies not getting straight as 
put him on something laugh laugh so sil i guess iver yeah sil cutoffanand iver 
i think vocnoise its really sil you really have to be careful who you put 
on the medication and how much you put them on vocnoise and how long they 
stay on it vocnoise and sil and most kids dont like being on medication vocnoise 
because it makes them different vocnoise they dont look at it like sil gee im 
really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to 
help me concentrate vocnoise they look it like vocnoise well none of my friends have 
to do it so why do i have to do it vocnoise yknow laugh vocnoise 
they look at it like its a big pain because they gotta run over to 
the nurse and get their pill at lunch and sil vocnoise generally sil the long 
acting theyre time released ones theres only a couple of them sil vocnoise sil a 
couple of the different medications that are out in the time release vocnoise and they 
only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time release 
vocnoise and it wears off and it doesnt sil do what its supposed to so 
they go back to vocnoise the six hour sil dosage yknow one in the morning 
one at lunch vocnoise and then their friends all know that they have to go 
get their pill and then theyre late to the lunch line and sil vocnoise sil 
yknow they just hate it vocnoise sil so vocnoise sil but it isnt something they 
can vocnoise a lot of kids sil will not sil i guess theyre in sil 
denial just like sil we would be sil they say sil it doesnt help me 
i dont need it vocnoise but when you sit down and say okay vocnoise what 
are the things youre able to do when youre on it sil sil that you 
really have trouble with when youre off of it and they see it in black 
and white they go vocnoise sil oh yeah iver sil i did get better grades 
last nine weeks didnt i sil vocnoise sil wow isnt that amazing you were taking 
your pills then vocnoise sil some connection here laugh so you kind of just have 
to sit them down and and say well lets just go through some of the 
things that vocnoise give you trouble and well write them down and say sil oh 
well last nine weeks you did that without any problem at all sil vocnoise this 
nine weeks vocnoise you havent been able to focus on that sil vocnoise sil maybe 
vocnoisethemedicine does help you some sil maybe you just sil yknow not giving it credit 
iver by the eighth grade they are sil sixth and seventh graders pretty much know 
everything sil and youre the stupid one sil but by the time they get to 
eighth grade theyre going vocnoise sil oh youre the best teacher i cant believe i 
said that to you laugh iver or they sil yeah sil they come back to 
visit me sometimes from the high school iver three years sil i have them vocnoise 
usually i have them sixth seventh and eighth sil for those sil language arts subjects 
sil unless they get sil some miraculous cure sil and they get sil phased out 
sil vocnoise sil like right now im phasing a kid an eighth grader out and 
into the regular english vocnoise but he worked really really hard sil and hes very 
bright vocnoise sil and hes still a terrible speller sil but sil he sil is 
not lazy sil and he does his assignments sil vocnoise sil and as long as 
you clearly sil explain to him what hes supposed to do and hes a good 
writer sil vocnoise sil and cutoffr usually when he misspells something you can figure out 
what it says from the context sil vocnoise sil yknow so were in the process 
of phasing him out sil so that he wont have to sil vocnoise sil hes 
had help sil i think since he was in kindergarten sil thats the other thing 
thats really an enigma about these kids sil vocnoise sil ninety percent of the time 
their i q is like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty vocnoise 
sil and i mean theyre very bright sil but yet sil something sil isnt sil 
iver connecting sil some wires are crossed up here or something sil vocnoise sil and 
theyre sil cutoffaand sil cutoffaand so they become very distrustful of adults because sil vocnoise 
sil all their life peopleve been saying sil sil noise sil youre really smart sil 
no youre not dumb sil vocnoise but they sit in class and they see their 
friends just catch on to things vocnoise and that they cant do vocnoise and so 
then they say vocnoise well my parents are just saying that because they love me 
sil im really stupid vocnoise yknow sil and you have to actually ow them when 
they get to be this age that vocnoise look you have a hundred and seventeen 
i q iver so that m means youre a good problem solver youre a good 
logical vocnoise thinker sil vocnoise youre good in science youre good at math sil yknow 
vocnoise so theres a few things youre not good at sil doesnt mean youre stupid 
sil yknow sil id much rather be stranded on an island with six sil iver 
l d kids than iver iver with six normal kids vocnoise because l d kids 
would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there vocnoise 
and the normal kids would sit and cry iver yknow iver oh yes they are 
iver well vocnoise generally sil they have some area vocnoise i dont think ive ever 
met the kid sil yet the noisespecial kid sil who sil has no sil area 
sil that he doesnt excel in like sil once i had a vocnoise sixth grade 
girl who sil still didnt know her time tables in sixth grade but she had 
a beverly sills opera voice vocnoise and in every single school production she was the 
lead singer sil vocnoise i had a girl once that won all kind of medals 
in gymnastics at the state level vocnoise it seems like when god takes away from 
you he gives something back ive had kids who they vocnoise got every badge you 
can get in boy scouts and vocnoise yknow i mean theres usually something that theyre 
vocnoise really sil it might not be related to school vocnoise but theres usually something 
that theyre really really good at in some other area vocnoise like theres vocnoise swimming 
or vocnoise or scouting or whatever so vocnoise they vocnoise yknow vocnoise but generally speaking 
they will attack a problem vocnoise a totally different way than the norm vocnoise and 
they will come up with sil much more creative solutions sil than the normal vocnoise 
person with a hundred vocnoise or ninety five i q sil now ive seen them 
long noiseenough to know that vocnoise and worked with them long enough to know that 
vocnoise well like i have one boy who cant spell them he still spells it 
t h i m vocnoise and he took my computer apart the other day and 
vocnoise adjusted something in the mother board and put it back together now it works 
iver sil now i mean vocnoise if you saw his writing youd think a cave 
man wrote it vocnoise it looks like sil hieroglyphics or something vocnoise but sil i 
want something done with my printers or my computers i just go hey jared sil 
im having trouble with this printer vocnoise takes it all apart sil fixes it i 
mean vocnoise hes laughreally really iver oh yeah iver well sil thats the other thing 
theyre a lot of times theyre good in the arts vocnoise theyre either sil an 
artist ive a boy right now thats an eighth grader thats painting vocnoise a huge 
canvas for me sil for my living room vocnoise because i havent been able to 
find a picture so i brought in the picture vocnoise and hes vocnoise enlarging it 
and painting it for me vocnoise in his free time and sil its gonna go 
in my living room sil and i mean its vocnoise its cutoffmemean i mean hes 
really quite the artist vocnoise in vocnoise music vocnoise arts vocnoise um sil literature acting 
ive had kids thatve been like vocnoise really sil top notch actors in the school 
plays vocnoise cutoffiits sil its just sil not necessarily sil a school kind of thing 
that theyre gonna be good at sil but i try to explain to the parents 
that sil just because your child learns differently vocnoise sil is sil no reason to 
think they wont be successful in life vocnoise mark spitz sil won an olympic gold 
medal vocnoise he has a learning disability sil cher bono cant remember a phone number 
without transposing two of the numbers vocnoise and she says that herself vocnoise um sil 
einstein didnt learn to read until he was twelve vocnoise um sil winston churchill vocnoise 
he stuttered until he was like seven or eight vocnoise uh walt disney was told 
by a manager at woolworths that he would never have a creative idea in his 
life iver and fired him iver um vocnoise beethoven sil i think it sil was 
beethoven that didnt talk sil till he was like seven vocnoise they thought he was 
retarded vocnoise but you see these people just sil theyre brains wired differently than ours 
is and vocnoise you just sil you cant ever expect them sil to approach any 
sil problem like you would vocnoise because they wont sil it just doesnt seem logical 
to them vocnoise theyre usually real good at puzzles sil theyre usually real good at 
sil yknow sil things that vocnoise manipulatives sil things that dont take words sil things 
that you just hafta solve sil by just manipulating things around vocnoise yeah iver some 
of them are pretty good at that some of them arent too sil laugh some 
of them like when you have them copy uh like vocnoise up sil from this 
box down to this box these little shapes sil in a certain amount of time 
sil vocnoise if their visual perception is messed up sil they screw that all up 
vocnoise they vocnoise yknow the form goes this way they draw it this way sil 
their brain flips it around on them vocnoise thats why they have trouble with ns 
and us vocnoise and bs and ds sil and theyre still reversing noise yknow vocnoise 
you vocnoise cutoffmamy normal kids that goes away about age eight vocnoise my kids theyre 
still doing it sil yknow theyre still vocnoise cutoffmamake or they might make an eight 
from the bottom up sil instead of from the top down or a six from 
the bottom up vocnoise i even had a kid once that made ones from the 
bottom up vocnoise you could tell by watching them write that their brain didnt work 
like yours did iver well that vocnoise yeah cutoffyyou iver well usually normal kids iver 
thats vocnoise thats yeah its sil developmental vocnoise because by the sil did you know 
the reason they picked the age five to start school vocnoise its errorbecuthbecausethats errorsatsbecausethats when 
vocnoise some sil expert sil thought sil that vocnoise one hemisphere or the other vocnoise 
was sil dominant sil but now they found out that the full dominance doesnt take 
over till about age eight iver you have a preference at five or six vocnoise 
but by the time you turn eight vocnoise one of your hemispheres is pretty much 
decided its gonna be the one that runs the show vocnoise well then vocnoise thats 
when sil those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops 
out of the picture sil so sil hm iver oh iver no sil i thought 
my son iver the one thats eighteen now sil i thought he was gonna be 
left handed up noiseuntil noisehe noisewas like four vocnoise because his dads left handed my 
sisters left handed sil i have one left handed parent vocnoise well all of sudden 
one day he picked up the thing with the right hand and hes been vocnoise 
cutoffwriwriting with his right hand ever since vocnoise so you really cant tell sil because 
they sil theyre pretty much sil either or until theyre about five iver and you 
dont have to worry if she writes her name backwards like a mirror image iver 
yknow vocnoise because thatll all go away about second grade iver oh good iver i 
always hate it when people name their kids vocnoise jamilia kenisha sil and im like 
iver oh boy vocnoise is this sil kindergarten teacher gonna have fun with this iver 
little girl sil vocnoise cutoffii sil i always think you should name a kid sil 
i have opinions about everything see vocnoise i think you should name a kid vocnoise 
something that will fit him at eighty three sil and eight sil and in between 
sil like we named our son robert vocnoise so when he was little he was 
robbie sil now hes eighteen hes rob vocnoise when he becomes an attorney or whatever 
he wants to do he can be robert sil paul excludename sil yknow vocnoise and 
sil in kindergarten all he had to learn to write was sil r o b 
sil or r o b b y sil so that it sil yknow sil i 
have a hard time picturing an eighty three year old woman as a tammy sil 
iver for example so you should name sil her tamara iver and call her tammy 
when shes little iver and then she can be called tam iver yknow when shes 
in her middle years and tamara when shes sil yknow sil but sil yknow i 
finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing sil its the one 
thing in life we get to do vocnoise where theres no restrictions sil no laws 
sil nobody gives you any limitations or parameters vocnoise they just say go for it 
and people just go nuts with it iver yeah iver over that sil right sil 
and iver i uh i say you should sil look vocnoise what we did is 
we look in the newspaper vocnoise and we found the top ten boys and the 
top ten girls names that have been the most popular for the last fifty years 
iver and we pick out of those sil because sil otherwise sil your kids gonna 
hate you sil iver sil emmas sort of a timeless name sil in that its 
sil its sil yknow sil been around for a long time vocnoise yet sil people 
dont associate it with vocnoise old women because vocnoise there are still emmas today iver 
i mean iver right iver and i mean its vocnoise its a cutoffwword sil easy 
to spell sil its easy to say sil and yknow cutoffiits you can shorten it 
to em sil or iver iver laughyeah vocnoise but um sil some names are just 
like vocnoise we had a friend once that sil she got pregnant sil like after 
her two boys were almost grown up vocnoise and they didnt ever expect to have 
another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy vocnoise so she named the little 
girl after her mother and her mothers name was harriet iver and im like vocnoise

really upset me vocnoise i was at um vocnoise this convention downtown the convention center 
vocnoise and sil uh one of the vocnoise ladies that was presenting one of the 
workshops is a vocnoise college professor in english sil at one of the ohio colleges 
and she said sil vocnoise when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five vocnoise they 
would always sil she teaches writing sil technical writing sil for people to do when 
they get out into the industry world vocnoise reports and stuff vocnoise she said they 
used to say sil gear your writing sil to a person whos in the eighth 
grade iver she said you know what they say now sil and i raised my 
hand and said sixth sil she said sil fourth iver gear your writing sil for 
a fourth grader and everyone will that you sil erroreverymbodyeverybody thats gonna read the memo 
will be able to read iver iver well iver doesnt have any words in it 
like exacerbate or undoubtedly i tell you that laugh iver but thats yknow thats a 
sign that sil that sil not only are we doing the dumbing down of jobs 
iver iver doing the dumbing down of schools iver iver iver iver readers digest sil 
used to write their sil digest on the eighth grade level and they now write 
it on the sixth grade level sil newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade 
level vocnoise for the general public its just vocnoise sil either vocnoise were getting more 
and more l d kids that arent learning to read sil or vocnoise um sil 
kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that sil well 
vocnoise i read one article vocnoise that said that vocnoise because kids sit in front 
of a television set sil from the time theyre born until theyre five vocnoise when 
they come to kindergarten they dont participate sil vocnoise they want to sit back and 
be entertained sil and theyre expecting you to do all this stuff sil and theyre 
just gonna watch iver and they have to become an active learner and they have 
to be taught how to participate iver mm iver not so much when i was 
teaching it sil because sil i think iver when i was teaching it sil that 
was kind of before all the moms went to work iver but since sil all 
the moms have gone to work sil and let the tv become the electronic babysitter 
vocnoise and the other thing thats happening sil is kids do not know things now 
that youd expect them to know like vocnoise because their moms arent reading to them 
sil like they dont know who winnie the pooh is iver or they dont know 
who eyor iver vocnoise or you sil say something to a kid about um three 
blind mice iver or yknow the things that we learned when we were kids because 
vocnoise our mom sil taught them or we learned them at church in a game 
or something vocnoise they all look at you like sil christopher robin whos that sil 
piglet sil whos that vocnoise yknow these theres a whole generation of kids now vocnoise 
whose moms did not stay home and read to them and all that fairy tale 
stuff vocnoise and nursery rhyme stuff vocnoise they dont have a clue what youre talking 
about iver well sil some of them are i guess vocnoise depending on sil where 
they go but vocnoise i had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that 
if a kid vocnoise she only has maybe one or two kids in her whole 
class vocnoise that hasnt gone to preschool sil or daycare vocnoise and she said it 
takes that kid sil up till christmas sil to catch up sil with the sil 
things the other kids come in already knowing sil thats how far behind they are 
vocnoise used to be in kindergarten you were expected vocnoise to know your colors sil 
and your name and your address sil you didnt even have to write it it 
sil you just had to know how to say it and your phone number vocnoise 
and um vocnoise recognize the color words sil and sil know how to sit down 
and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise 
your hand and social skills vocnoise and that was about extall they expected you to 
sil play cooperatively vocnoise and vocnoise thats about all they expect you to know now 
in kindergarten vocnoise they expected you to know all that vocnoise plus by the time 
you get to first grade youre supposed to have vocnoise cutoffb sil cutoffin sil oh 
and the numbers you used to sil from one to thirty sil it used to 
be if you could cutoffssay sil uh sil say them sil in order sil and 
recognize them sil you didnt even have to know how to spell the word vocnoise 
or write them down vocnoise now sil they want you to know the numbers one 
through a hundred vocnoise youre supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you 
go to first grade sil vocnoise like and the of is all those little words 
sil youre already supposed to know those vocnoise youre supposed to sil be able to 
write a sentence sil even if its just a little short sentence like my name 
is joanne vocnoise i live at blah blah blah street vocnoise i mean its incredible 
vocnoise its like sil the curriculum keeps moving down sil and down sil and down 
iver well sil theyre supposed to do more too but by the time they get 
to fourth grade theyre so busy trying to be the class clown vocnoise they decide 
its a lot more important to impress your friends than it is to vocnoise fill 
your mind with knowledge iver yknow sil they talk about drinking from the fountain now 
theyre only gargling sil theyre not drinking sil much sil by the time they get 
to be fourth or fifth grade theyre pretty savvy these days sil theyre not sil 
too scared to tell you sil where to go and what to do iver oh 
yeah sil oh yeah used to be vocnoise when i first started teaching even up 
to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful iver and they would ask yknow can i 
do this can i use this vocnoise uh kids now if i take my phone 
off and lay it on my desk vocnoise kids will walk right up and just 
take it sil they wont ask me theyll just cutoffl vocnoise oh vocnoise and then 
they start pushing cutoffbutbuttons vocnoise is this your phone vocnoise im like sil uh vocnoise 
if i were at your house and i went in your bedroom and started messing 
with your stuff without asking you wouldnt like it much would you iver yknow iver 
just general manners iver i think its because parents are at work and theyre busy 
making money and theyre not teaching their kids any vocnoise i mean theyre not cutofftataking 
teaching them to say thank you and please and just the normal vocnoise yknow vocnoise 
um thanks for having me when you go to someones house vocnoise just the normal 
sil i cant tell you how many kids ive picked up vocnoise and driven home 
sil when i picked up my son because it was raining or something vocnoise and 
they just jump out of the car and go bye slam the door vocnoise and 
i turn to my son and i go sil dont you ever do that to 
someones mother vocnoise now how bad do you think i want to give sil him 
another ride home vocnoise when he didnt even say thank you sil yknow i didnt 
have to bother to go out of my way vocnoise and id always try to 
use that as a sil way to explain to my kids sil okay yknow sil 
this is how he handled it vocnoise this is how i want you to handle 
it vocnoise i dont ever want you to go to someones house and not say 
vocnoise thanks for inviting me thanks for having me vocnoise i really had a good 
time vocnoise yknow and i dont ever want you to sit at somebody elses table 
and go vocnoise yuk i dont like that vocnoise yknow sil if they having something 
for supper you dont like vocnoise you pass it vocnoise on and you go i 
dont care for any thank you vocnoise you dont make a big scene like so 
and so did the other night at my house that sil yknow made me feel 
like this big sil when im the cook iver yknow vocnoise so you can use 
all those sil opportunities sil to show your kid sil what not to do iver 
and you can say well thats how that makes you feel when someone goes vocnoise 
eew were having ham vocnoise i hate ham the other night i had ham and 
i threw up and blah blah vocnoise and my mom made me eat it and 
i threw up all over the floor and im like vocnoise dont you ever do 
that when youre at someone elses cutoffhouhouse laugh iver they know more knowledge sil i 
wouldnt say theyre more vocnoise sil socially vocnoise sil mature or uh more um vocnoise 
sil um sil i mean theres even sweet little preschool girls that dont say please 
and thank you sil yknow you have to remind them iver sil well and i 
think it really cutoffstistill it still goes back to the mom and the dad sil 
and sil and what sil the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy 
vocnoise sil yknow would i act this way would that make my mom and because 
until youre about five sil vocnoise sil or four sil your parents are pretty important 
to you sil and what they think vocnoise so thats when sil yknow sil you 
have to instill that stuff sil you have to sil yknow sil cutoffthethey oh and 
they learn by watching you do it too vocnoise sil uh i mean my son 
now oh i saw him when lets see sil he was fifteen maybe sil vocnoise 
sil hed run across the street sil when martha the eighty six year old lady 
across errorsteereetthestreet vocnoise was trying to bring her garbage down sil hed seen me do 
that sil go oh let me get that for you martha vocnoise shes got sil 
arthritis she looks like shes gonna fall sil she takes steps about this big vocnoise 
and sil ive seen him do that iver he learned that from watching me do 
it sil he takes cutoffiit yknow we come home hell take the cutoffbbag sil the 
thing back up for her unknownsay oh martha will fall if she does this i 
better run over there and vocnoise take that up for her vocnoise well hes seen 
sil his cutoffmomom his mom and his dad do stuff like that vocnoise they really 
do learn best by example sil they really do sil yeah they do sil theyre 
much more likely to do what you do than do what you say vocnoise sil 
so you dont have to say anything as long as you live a good clean 
honest life vocnoise theyre gonna emulate you iver iver iver oh i think sil i 
think that the society sil in uh general is declining in a laughlotof ways sil 
vocnoise sil our morals are errordegcliningdegradingdeclining and our vocnoise sil uh sil intelligence level sil 
maybe not level i mean i qs are still high but people are vocnoise settling 
for less sil i have a big sign in my room that says never settle 
sil vocnoise sil for less than your very best vocnoise because i really think people 
vocnoise are getting lazy sil even adults cutoffwewe yknow we dont even want to wait 
twenty five seconds for microwave popcorn vocnoise we dont yknow were getting impatient iver yeah 
were getting impatient and were getting sil vocnoise sil um sil its its sort of 
like yknow the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from 
now therell be vocnoise kidsll be yknow in this country will be learning more than 
they ever have vocnoise but right now i think were sil vocnoise sil were really 
not sil doing justice sil to sil the curriculum sil and i say to cutoffmmy 
my friends i say vocnoise teach these kids well because theyre gonna be running the 
country in our old age vocnoise well be sit in a rocking chair and theyll 
be running the country so you better teach them well sil when you look at 
it like that iver you its quite an investment iver iver when you think that 
sil our major resource sil is cutoffchchildren sil is our children and our offspring vocnoise 
sil then wed better not sil yknow iver well i think iver well i think 
in general like sil lets say if you took sil a sil handful of executives 
from borden or vocnoise a t and t or vocnoise someplace like that vocnoise you 
would probably find that sil in general theyre very concerned iver if theyre especially if 
theyre over forty vocnoise because their companys giving money back to the community for this 
and that sil and vocnoise yknow thats how theyre trying to show that they care 
about this theyre trying to vocnoise mentor some school or some group of kids or 
give money for the vocnoise downtrodden or sil yknow sil but sil youre right i 
think its terrible that sil every other country in the world sil vocnoise sil has 
higher math skills than we do sil vocnoise sil better science skills than we do 
sil vocnoise sil better language errorshkillsskills than we do sil vocnoise sil why canadians even 
go to school for thirteen years not twelve vocnoise yknow sil and vocnoise i just 
think that sil this proficiency thing is finally going to vocnoise make people accountable sil 
iver the proficiency tests that theyre now requiring vocnoise you cant graduate from an ohio 
high school sil vocnoise sil with a cutoffgragraduate uh with a diploma sil unless you 
pass sil all the proficiency tests vocnoise and that means you have to take vocnoise 
one in citizenship sil which is like government and history vocnoise one in math vocnoise 
one in science sil vocnoise sil one in writing sil and one in reading sil 
vocnoise sil and you have sil you can try to sil pass vocnoise the first 
time in the cutoffeeighth at the end of the eighth grade vocnoise and you get 
two tries in the ninth grade sil two tries in the tenth sil two in 
the eleventh two in the twelfth vocnoise you can take them as many times as 
you need to take them vocnoise but if you dont pass them all by the 
time you graduate vocnoise you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate sil 
its not a real diploma its like okay i attended sil i didnt learn anything 
vocnoise but i was there iver how many people want that iver iver sil iver 
and the questions arent easy sil sil i mean sil i mean the sil i 
doubt if i could pass some of them sil i mean vocnoise sil i probably 
could pass the citizenship and the vocnoise sil and the english sil vocnoise sil and 
maybe the science because i like science and i keep up on that stuff but 
i doubt if i could pass the math sil because i dont teach math and 
i dont use math that much vocnoise other than just normal sil yknow add subtract 
multiply iver yeah and geometry and and trig and calculus and physics and sil vocnoise 
sil a little smattering of everything sil and uh sil i bet i couldnt pass 
the vocnoise i bet i couldnt pass the math without some vocnoise instruction sil but 
sil my son didnt pass the writing part he passed everything but the writing part 
vocnoise and the writing part sil they ask you to write sil two sil five 
paragraph essays and they give you these topics and you can pick from them vocnoise 
and you have to do it right there sil in like a three hour block 
of time iver no sil the prompts are only given out that day vocnoise even 
the teachers dont know what theyre gonna be vocnoise and it might be something as 
general as tell about your neighborhood vocnoise or it might be something as specific as 
vocnoise sil when you were little what sil toy was your most favorite sil and 
you have to write five paragraphs on it sil so laugh sil laugh iver no 
more than five because theres a specific sil vocnoise sil um sil its called the 
five paragraph essay sil the first paragraph is your introduction and the final one is 
your conclusion and the three in the middle is the body that develops your idea 
vocnoise sil so vocnoise im teaching all my kids right iver one of those vocnoise 
iver on different topics iver oh its some committee sil i mean you have to 
send them in to vocnoise some place at the state of ohio iver no iver 
we send them in sil and then sil vocnoise sil the kids sil lets see 
the eighth graders take them in march and then we get the cutoffpapapers vocnoise the 
scores back in may sil sometime vocnoise and um sil some of my kids vocnoise 
sil well i have a group of kids that i had them when they were 
sixth graders and they just now graduated sil from high school and cutoffii sil one 
in that original group of kids that i had vocnoise never did pass them all 
sil but vocnoise i guess sil vocnoise hes not worried because hes gonna work with 
his dad in his dads business sil so hes gonna be okay but vocnoise he 
never did pass the reading and the writing he passed everything else but vocnoise and 
the questions arent the same sil cutoffthetheres i mean theres several different forms every time 
they send out sil the test its sealed in a box and sil nobody is 
allowed to open it but the principal sil and sil then he has to distribute 
it to the teachers and vocnoise cutoffaand so the questions could change iver and they 
might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag vocnoise 
or uh how much of a sil uh sil how much do you have to 
have of the senate vocnoise to pass a law sil yknow it could be something 
real real sil technical or something vocnoise that sil a three year old could answer 
sil because its trying to hit vocnoise yknow vocnoise all the areas that youve learned 
iver i think theyre retired teachers or vocnoise people on maybe the board at different 
school districts or sil i dont know vocnoise well iver course the multiple choice theres 
a right or wrong answer and iver vocnoise but sil the writing vocnoise they give 
you one point for each sil paragraph so you hafta get sil five points to 
pass sil sil now you might get four out of five and almost pass sil 
and then you hafta retake that one part iver sil well yeah thats kind of 
subjective although vocnoise sil there is a paper that sil we hand out to our 
kids thats tells exactly whats supposed to be in every part of this essay vocnoise 
like the first the introductory paragraphs supposed to consist of vocnoise a way to capture 
the readers attention sil its suppose to supply background information vocnoise its supposed to state 
your thesis statement which tells mainly what the cutoffpapapers papers gonna be about vocnoise and 
then youre supposed to end the introductory paragraph by listing three ideas sil about your 
thesis vocnoise that youre going to develop in paragraphs two three and four vocnoise so 
i mean its iver iver iver well most kids what they do is sil they 
tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in 
the cutoffintrintroduction vocnoise most people get ahead of themselves iver yknow before they vocnoise tell 
you sil this was last summer and it was on a vacation to myrtle beach 
vocnoise theyre telling you about the surfboard that they got sil and how sil great 
they surfed vocnoise when that really should come down in the body of the paper 
vocnoise yknow most people just sil they assume the reader knows sil i always say 
to my kids vocnoise pretend like youre writing for an alien iver iver nothing about 
this planet iver like i had my kids last week i had them all write 
vocnoise how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich vocnoise and then vocnoise i 
had them one by one come up to the table in the front they didnt 
know i was gonna do this vocnoise so after they get cutoffeeverything all done i 
go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my 
bread and my peanut butter and my jelly vocnoise and i sit them down beside 
me vocnoise and i go okay now no ad libbing sil no adding no taking 
away read exactly what you wrote iver and i do exactly what they said vocnoise 
if they say cover the entire piece of bread with peanut butter vocnoise i cover 
both sides iver crust vocnoise uh the entire piece of bread vocnoise if they say 
reach in the vocnoise bag and grab two pieces of bread i reach in the 
bag and grab them and by the time i get them out theyve got holes 
in them vocnoise because to me thats what grab means iver whereas sil yknow iver 
if you just said take sil or get sil i just sil i say well 
sil im just gonna vocnoise sil because when you get unknowninthatinthe work sil out in 
the work world sil theres gonna be two things they care about about your writing 
sil is it useable sil and is it persuasive sil because usually when youre writing 
something in the workplace vocnoise its either to explain something sil or its to persuade 
somebody to do something sil so if its not those two things sil its not 
sil its not writing sil thats gonna make it in the world sil its i 
mean iver oh i have a few kids from time to time that said they 
want to be writers vocnoise which yknow they have great ideas but usually vocnoise they 
cant sil they can tell you them but when they write it sil my kids 
vocnoise usually vocnoise they leave out words or they vocnoise leave off a suffix at 
the end or and the sentence makes no sense sil yknow sil i have to 
call them up and go sil what does this say iver or does this say 
this vocnoise yknow sil this is what i thought this said does that what that 
really says vocnoise well heres a perfect example the other day vocnoise my kids sil 
my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal heres the 
animal i would be and heres why vocnoise and they had to research the animal 
they had like a month to do it vocnoise and they had to pick any 
animal and tell about their feeding habits and their vocnoise whether they travel in groups 
or alone and vocnoise of what part of the world they mostly habitat vocnoise what 
they eat all that vocnoise okay perfect example sil one of my students wanted to 
say vocnoise my animal sil that i picked lives mostly on vegetables vocnoise and he 
couldnt figure out how to spell it vocnoise so he went into the computer and 
he sil asked it vocnoise and it gave him the word vestibules iver iver iver 
said to me that cant be wrong because the computer said sil that was a 
word vocnoise i said that is a word vocnoise come with me ill show you 
what a vestibule is iver so we walked across the street to the church iver 
iver i said theres a big iver thats a vestibule sil does your animal eat 
those sil my animal eats mostly vestibules iver i laughsee laughi mean you see vocnoise 
the computer sil cant be wrong he said iver i said well he cutoffdididnt it 
didnt spell vestibules wrong vocnoise but i doubt if your animal eats sil parts of 
buildings vocnoise laugh iver perfect yknow or your computer cant tell you that you vocnoise 
spelled o n e sil when you meant to spell sil w o n iver 
we won we were victorious vocnoise we didnt one sil laugh laughyknow vocnoise iver oh 
yeah sil uh iver uh sil well a lot of my kids do much better 
vocnoise with writing on the computer vocnoise because they know that vocnoise they can go 
back and change it or fix it or they can get spelling help or they 
can even get grammar help vocnoise or they can maybe even get vocnoise syntax help 
cutoffiif sil if it says this is awkward or something turn the sentence around vocnoise 
so my students do a lot better with writing if they do it on the 
computer vocnoise than if they are asked to do it sil pencil and paper sil 
so thats what i make them do their webbing sil you know what a webbing 
is dont you sil vocnoise where you cutoffpput sil web out an idea you iver 
and it looks like a spider web iver i make them do their webbing sil 
and get their rough draft started sil and then they can go to the computer 
sil because they i find they um they are a little more creative when they 
get to sil vocnoise think about adding pictures and vocnoise we call it publishing it 
sil when you get to the publishing stage iver you should have all your errors 
corrected vocnoise even if you vocnoise have to rewrite it six times i mean cutoffthathat 
it just blows their mind when i say to them vocnoise well the other day 
i wrote a letter to a senator sil and i had to write it six 
times sil i wrote the letter sil and rewrote it vocnoise until it was perfect 
vocnoise and every time i rewrote it it got better sil and i wrote it 
six times sil and im an english teacher iver and i tell them writing is 
not an event sil its a process sil its like getting your braces put on 
sil you go in one time sil and they might pull a couple teeth sil 
vocnoise sil and you go in the next time they might put that little wire 
on vocnoise sil then you go in the next time they might put the lower 
ones on or part of them sil vocnoise sil and the next time sil then 
they put on more vocnoise and then one time sil theyll tighten them a little 
vocnoise but its a process that happens over a period of three years sil vocnoise 
its not an event vocnoise they think they can sit down and write sil okay 
im done sil im like laugh sil i dont think so sil laughyeah vocnoise writing 
is a iver iver yeah iver well and iver dont you think iver yeah iver 
well i often have to write on papers vocnoise i believe you turned in the 
wrong paper vocnoise i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy 
vocnoise do you have the final copy somewhere at home iver or on your hard 
drive sil um vocnoise because this really for all the world looks to me just 
like a rough draft sil or ill say to my students have your mom look 
it over have your sister look it over vocnoise have somebody else proofread it vocnoise 
because youre not gonna see the mistakes because vocnoise youre too busy thinking about the 
content sil of what you wanted to say vocnoise and youre not gonna notice them 
spelled t h i m vocnoise or they t h a y vocnoise yeah sil 
or a sentence thats too long sil or a sentence thats a fragment and it 
isnt a complete thought sil youre not gonna notice that vocnoise because you know what 
it was supposed say vocnoise so give it to a p friend or somebody and 
let them vocnoise just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they dont 
understand sil and that will really help you sil oh vocnoise well i had a 
iver sil i had a student bring me a paper today vocnoise he said this 
is for history vocnoise i have to write an essay on anthony wayne and the 
battle at fallen timbers vocnoise heres my i rough draft vocnoise would you fix it 
for me before i make my final copy so ill get a good grade vocnoise 
see cutoffii i tell them i said noisethats what im here for vocnoise yknow sil 
im here to help you sil use me vocnoise to help you get better grades 
vocnoise use me to run interference vocnoise if you think you know the science vocnoise 
but youre getting marked down because you cant spell the words vocnoise let me know 
ill go talk to your science teacher vocnoise tell her not to count your spelling 
sil or not sil yknow not to make you take the test without the little 
spell checker thing thats in your book bag vocnoise to let you use that i 
mean vocnoise sil i do a lot of um vocnoise what i call advocating for 
my kids with the regular ed teachers that dont understand sil i go in and 
i say well vocnoise yknow this is kind of a long test vocnoise could he 
maybe take half today and half tomorrow vocnoise or sil would you mind if he 
came out to my room sil ninth period during study hall vocnoise because i have 
a free noiseperiod and i could sil like kind of monitor it and vocnoise and 
read the words he doesnt know so that hes actually answering what the question really 
says vocnoise instead of what he thinks it says vocnoise so that you wont be 
testing his reading ability but youll really be testing whether he knows about magnetism iver 
oh iver iver oh yes theyre getting better though they really are vocnoise theyre much 
better now than they were twenty years ago vocnoise because noisethe trend is sil noiseto 
noisekeep these students in the mainstream as much as possible vocnoise so teachers are having 
to learn vocnoise to vocnoise for example iver yeah how to modify vocnoise like sil 
i give sil in services all the time at my school for the regular ed 
teachers and i show them vocnoise they go well thats gonna make more work for 
me and i say how is telling the student to do every other problem vocnoise 
instead of all forty of them gonna make iver iver iver iver iver im iver 
iver iver iver iver iver iver laughyeah laugh so sil or sil how hard can 
it be to say to a student if you have a student with an eighty 
i q for example vocnoise and you know hes not gonna get all the details 
and the battles and the years and the vocnoise captains names but sil you just 
want him to get the overall gist of the french and american war was about 
this time uh cutoffpperiod vocnoise in history and this was the result and this is 
how long it lasted vocnoise just the main concepts vocnoise well theres the kid that 
you say sil todd sil you study for the test and when you come in 
ill let you answer anything on the test you know sil and anything you dont 
know you leave blank sil and ill just grade what you put down iver now 
that doesnt make any extra work for the teacher sil but sil it gives him 
a shot sil he usually will answer sil the concepts hell usually answer the main 
stuff that he knows vocnoise and if you only grade him on that vocnoise sil 
he might have a shot at a c or a b sil i mean theres 
sil all kind of ways to modify vocnoise sil uh cutoffrreduced sil give a reduced 
work amount vocnoise sil uh give a kid a copy of another students notes if 
his are crummy and he cutoffkcant cant study from them sil vocnoise sil we even 
have a thing at our school sil that sil its sil it looks just like 
notebook paper vocnoise and its got the three holes and the lines and every teacher 
has a stack of it on their desk vocnoise but its sil n c r 
sil yknow the sil two copies sil iver you write on the top iver n 
c r paper vocnoise so when you write on the white copy it comes through 
onto the yellow copy vocnoise and at the end of the period vocnoise the student 
just rips off the back copy and hands it to his friend sil so he 
didnt have to write sil yknow if he wasnt getting the notes iver sil and 
he didnt spell them and he couldnt read them later vocnoise nobody has to know 
that sil so and so went down the hall and made a copy of so 
and sos notes on the xerox machine for the dumb kid sil yknow sil you 
just sil yknow you just sil say to one sil student that sits in the 
front thats usually a girl vocnoise who usually yknow writes really neat and gets it 
all iver vocnoise just go suzy would you vocnoise use this paper today vocnoise because 
were gonna review for the test sil and then at the end of the period 
vocnoise sil when the kids are leaving sil and give johnnie a copy of it 
sil the back copy would you do that for me sil well the girls usually 
write neater sil and they usually get sil a girl that doesnt have a learning 
disability they usually get everything down off the board vocnoise whereas the boys noisewill get 
a little distracted vocnoise or theyll sil yknow maybe not cutoffsisit sil they dont tend 
to sit up front sil theyll sit in the back so they can sil yknow 
sil jab their friend with a pencil and vocnoise throw the cutofff sil paper wads 
and stuff sil iver so iver oh yeah sil almost always vocnoise doesnt matter what 
sil um the disability is sil laughand laughi dont know why this is vocnoise but 
they used to say eight to one vocnoise now theyre saying more like five to 
one vocnoise doesnt matter if its a speech impediment sil blindness retardation vocnoise cerebral palsy 
deafness vocnoise learning cutoffdisadisability you name it sil theres cutoffaalways sil five to one more 
boys than there are girls sil and we dont sil know why iver iver iver 
well deafness for example uh and blindness are not always genetic vocnoise they dont know 
why sil they just know that errorthitthatit sil shows up more in boys than girls 
sil this year i dont have vocnoise one i have sixteen students sil and i 
dont have one girl sil fact i havent had any girls for a couple of 
years sil i usually have one or two girls and all the rest boys sil 
but iver oh iver theyre not as many of them or sil you mean because 
iver well um sil in the lower grades i believe that they are because sil 
i think they should have some male sil role models iver the lower grades sil 
we have a few sil male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not 
many vocnoise but i think sil that sil young men sil young boys would do 
better sil in a sil setting in school if they had a sil a man 
earlier on sil rather than having to wait till vocnoise theyre in middle school sil 
to relate to a coach sil and up until then its always been a woman 
iver iver iver iver iver dont go into elementary ed that much iver that often 
sil they do but vocnoise theres just not near as many of them sil i 
can count on one hand the number of vocnoise cutoffmmen um sil men teachers ive 
known over the years in elementary ed sil practically vocnoise yknow five sil maybe six 
sil thats thats probably why the boys dont sil yknow sil laughyeah iver really sil 
and its a fun job it really is i cutoffn ive only ever known one 
male sil that taught first grade sil and i knew one guy that taught third 
sil most the time if they go in to elementary ed they go for the 
upper grades like four five or six vocnoise but um sil i really think that 
sil if we let sil the boys be more exposed to men earlier sil then 
sil they would sil be more motivated to learn vocnoise because they would see that 
its not just a girly thing vocnoise they would say oh well mister so and 
so thinks its important that i know this sil and hes a real macho guy 
so i better learn it sil yknow sil i do i really do sil nowadays 
sil with the pay sil being better sil we are getting more men sil but 
iver in most cutoffcicities sil in most cutoffareaareas in most school districts its vocnoise comparable 
to sil any other job now it used to always be low but vocnoise like 
a sil beginning teacher in worthington starts at i think twenty six sil eight sil 
or something sil course worthingtons sil one of the sil three highest paid districts in 
ohio vocnoise um sil but sil cutoffiit it used to be that vocnoise teachers sil 
just got paid sil lower than a cutoffffireman sil starting fireman or starting policeman and 
vocnoise yknow you in a sense youre out there risking your life everyday too iver 
now that kids are carrying knives and guns and vocnoise things to school you never 
know if youre gonna walk into the building and sil and maybe not go home 
that day iver yeah sil yeah sil people say vocnoise things like sil oh i 
wish i had a job where i got three months off every summer vocnoise and 
im just i hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store and i 
just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and 
say vocnoise yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game vocnoise i was 
grading papers at the kitchen table sil yknow sil and if i go out of 
town on the weekend sil i have to take my school bag and all my 
work with me vocnoise it never ends sil yknow i put in about seventy hours 
a week during sil the time of the year when i do teach vocnoise and 
by the way its not three months anymore sil you work for a week after 
the kids get out of school in june sil which usually sil puts you at 
about the twelfth to the fifteenth of june sil school starts back the twenty third 
of august sil at least in worthington it did sil and you have to be 
back a week before that sil so theyve shaved both ends of that off till 
its sil its like sil noiseten days in june sil and maybe vocnoise fifteen days 
in august sil and all of july sil so sil and then you spend some 
of that time going to seminars vocnoise and upgrading your certificate iver taking classes vocnoise 
hopefully sil thats when you go to the dentist extand yknow you catch up on 
all that stuff too iver laughyeah laugh sil right if youre lucky laugh vocnoise but 
i mean sil theres the person that says that and then theres the other person 
that says sil oh i sure admire what you do and i wouldnt be a 
teacher for anything in this world laugh yknow and the the one thats just in 
awe of you iver and then theres the one thats like i wish i had 
two weeks off at christmas vocnoise well i used to work at harding hospital as 
a teacher sil when sil um sil i first went to worthington when i said 
i got another job sil i got sil a job vocnoise sil working at harding 
hospital as the sil i was the principal sil but i was also a teacher 
so i taught part of the day vocnoise and i was also the administrator vocnoise 
because they had a small school there for the kids that were in the adolescent 
unit vocnoise and they were away from home and they had to go to school 
and get their credit somewhere vocnoise so sil the doctors always used to sil we 
were on the vocnoise like each sil person would be on a team vocnoise of 
these kids that would be assigned to these kids vocnoise and youd go to your 
team meetings and the doctors sil the cutoffsshrinks shrinks would go vocnoise i wish i 
got two weeks off at christmas yknow theyd be bitching and moaning about the fact 
that vocnoise that we got time off and they didnt sil laughand laughi finally come 
up with the perfect thing one time i said well doctor simpson or whatever his 
name was doctor brown vocnoise you know how it is some of us went for 
the big bucks and some of us went for the time off iver sil he 
never said a thing again laugh like oh okay we went for the big bucks 
vocnoise we went for the time off sil everybody makes their choices sil now you 
got to live with them iver laugh sil these kids dont get well just because 
its the holidays sil unknownwell you guys should stay here and work along with us 
vocnoise yeah right sil we should also get noise a hundred and twenty five bucks 
an hour like you guys do to vocnoise laugh iver oh ill come back sil 
i mean sil if you need me to iver sil sil vocnoise sil laughumhumokay iver 
okay iver laugh iver its very difficult iver yeah sil i dont know why sil 
vocnoise uh columbus was just stubborn about it until vocnoise the last year vocnoise uh 
sil they hadnt errorbeynablebeenable able to get subs fifty cutoffpercpercent sil substitutes fifty percent of 
the time and so the teachers were screaming vocnoise and they were splitting the kids 
up and putting them in other classrooms well vocnoise sil i dont know if the 
parents made anything about it but i guess sil finally vocnoise yknow when you have 
fifty percent of your classrooms uncovered vocnoise sil uh they sil came to it and 
it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody vocnoise the kids the 
principal or the other teachers but now its like vocnoise oh thank you for coming 
oh thank you for coming vocnoise so i said maybe that worked a little bit 
but now just in the last two weeks vocnoise sil i think a lot of 
the retired teachers who werent messing around with it have come back in sil vocnoise 
sil so i dont know exactly what to sil vocnoise yeah laugh iver well sil 
uh sil when i came vocnoise sil uh back from oregon vocnoise sil my father 
was very ill vocnoise sil and so i didnt want full time work and i 
started substituting out in uh licking county vocnoise sil um sil cutoffih which sil paid 
cutofftterribly cutoffch cutofftterribly terribly low cutoffthetheres vocnoise cutoffthetheres theres all these little districts that has 
sil a superintendent vocnoise sil well no they have two elementaries one middle school and 
one high school and a superintendent which they dont need yknow vocnoise so theyd vocnoise 
hire vocnoise straight out of college always vocnoise and there there is a law that 
cutoffyyou sil uh you have to pay vocnoise sil for your accumulated time vocnoise so 
i couldnt get a job out there because i had about six years experience they 
had to pay me sil for vocnoise sil so i came cutoffiin back in to 
columbus and its a lot harder to work in columbus public but vocnoise but um 
vocnoise i i know the territory i know where im laughgoing laugh iver the population 
sil cutoffn is much different yes iver well cutoffththe you have uh you have an 
urban area with a lot of poor children vocnoise sil uh sil a lot of 
single parent families and just the population is changing period vocnoise sil from the uh 
the two parent family very vocnoise the mother not working into sil one parent with 
the mother working it makes a big difference in how the vocnoise sil child does 
at school iver yes its definitely having an effect on uh children and uh vocnoise 
sil vocnoise sil uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for 
it but they arent doing it yet sil whether they will be able to pick 
up enough sil vocnoise sil uh vocnoise sil by changing the way they teach and 
so on in the next twenty years i dont know but vocnoise sil uh im 
glad my children went to school when they did laugh laughandi stayed home with them 
iver laugh iver laugh laugh you should be vocnoise sil real attentive to whats happening 
in his school situation sil his or her iver laugh vocnoise yeah cutoffwwell you should 
be were all aware because the school has a big cutoffhahand vocnoise impact on the 
children and sometimes not all that positive right now sil so sil yknow but you 
can tell sil how your childs doing of course iver umhum sil vocnoise sil noise 
vocnoise sil at this point sil um vocnoise sil im not cutoffagagainst sil uh im 
not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i wouldnt 
errormrvmove sil move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together vocnoise sil 
they are cutoffsso sil in so uh such bad shape right now that vocnoise sil 
i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years 
yeah vocnoise theyve threatened it vocnoise um sil and if they dont pull their scores 
up vocnoise sil um they will vocnoise yknow iver no iver vocnoise iver uh laugh 
vocnoise sil my cutoffopinopinion sil vocnoise uh well im vocnoise sil um my opinion changes 
from day to day on laughwhosefaultitis laugh vocnoise sil uh actually sil vocnoise sil at 
this point in time i dont know whos fault it is vocnoise sil uh i 
think its the cutoffffault sil vocnoise sil fault of evolution laugh well it could have 
been prevented but we didnt know it was gonna happen that cutoffththat sil that our 
society was gonna change so intensely and we kind of vocnoise hung back and thought 
things would stay the same way they were and they havent and everybodys changing and 
vocnoise sil especially the younger people vocnoise and uh sil vocnoise we werent ready and 
we didnt change fast laughenoughwedidntget ready for the change that was coming iver columbus sil 
it seems to be laugh i mean its just like blah laugh iver i at 
this point i blame it on the administration sil vocnoise sil um sil and the 
citizens of columbus havent i mean uh two years ago or was it three years 
ago now vocnoise they defeated a levy vocnoise you should never defeat a school levy 
iver yknow they never ask for extra money vocnoise sil and uh vocnoise sil they 
had to cut back on everything and cutoffiit i think it just set people back 
now were trying real hard to catch up vocnoise sil and at some point were 
going to um sil vocnoise sil yknow have to put a levy on again and 
cutoffaand and sil uh sil who knows whats happen vocnoise sil were keeping rosa smith 
right now because shes vocnoise sil so good p r with the with the business 
community but the business community in columbus doesnt really support the schools cutoffi they dont 
sil i mean weve got two new uh vocnoise sil stadiums and we havent got 
any increase in school funding sil i started the school year off with uh vocnoise 
twenty seven kindergarteners sil and sil no aid iver vocnoise iver vocnoise and they were 
just wild sil yknow i just ran every minute and i vocnoise took it as 
a substitute vocnoise and didnt sil know from day to day yknow whether was gonna 
keep it i finally had to say i cant do this twenty seven kindergarteners vocnoise 
im sorry i cant do this laughbymyself laugh iver the teacher was there one day 
and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital 
sil vocnoise sil those things happen iver yeah iver cutoffyyeah they had to cutoffgrgrab sil 
and they just called me on the phone not knowing vocnoise sil yknow sil just 
that she went to the hospital vocnoise sil well they said to me will you 
stay well i said yes vocnoise sil but then cutoffaas sil cutoffaas when it got 
in to vocnoise two weeks and i wasnt getting any support from the principal or 
no aid or anything its like im sorry vocnoise im a vocnoise sil laughsubstitutesu vocnoise 
sil substitute im getting sixty dollars a day i cant vocnoise sil do this vocnoise 
sil unless sil yknow i have more help vocnoise and i just sil flatly said 
that im sorry i mean vocnoise sil if id a sil if it was my 
own job i would have struggled with it but it was not my own job 
sil and i didnt know what was gonna happen vocnoise so sil if they wouldve 
gotten some help in there cutoffffor sil for me i would have stayed perhaps but 
sil vocnoise sil no i i vocnoise sil you know you can work for under 
pay and under laughstaffandnever you just cant do everything vocnoise so iver a computer calls 
you laugh iver laughyeahyou iver uh uh vocnoise sil you talk to a computer always 
sil vocnoise you deal with a computer iver umhum iver umhum vocnoise sil vocnoise sil 
uh vocnoise they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you dont want 
to do it cutoffmomost vocnoise sil most usually i just put location sil i dont 
want to go certain places uh iver well like vocnoise a errormillion miles down to 
the south end or something like that sil vocnoise but you just punch in your 
numbers always you just talk with numbers vocnoise sil laugh iver uh huh iver laugh 
iver yeah iver umhum laugh iver oh really sil where are you from iver vocnoise 
iver laugh iver laugh iver umhum cutoffyyeah i i did i iver hm iver whats 
different cutoffiis vocnoise sil my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so cutoffththat 
vocnoise from that angle was i mean still is my vocnoise elementary school sitting there 
i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a 
high school but its there vocnoise sil a block away olentangy village vocnoise sil im 
right in where i always was i mean im sil i cutoffb was raised on 
como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now vocnoise so i made 
a errorfellfull sil full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area sil 
vocnoise and it is really neat sil you know compared to any other cities course 
sil im vocnoise i loved oregon i was very rural vocnoise for eighteen years iver 
um um i was at eugene and i wasnt even laughineugene it was hundred thousand 
yknow vocnoise and uh vocnoise sil vocnoise i loved that but vocnoise i cutoffs sil 
vocnoise then i came back and i live in olentangy village which is right on 
the river vocnoise sil and its very uh sil very scenic very beautiful iver oh 
iver oh did you come in iver uhhuh iver its kind of an neat place 
isnt it iver uh huh its got iver yeah iver and uh well she cutoffstarstarted 
the cutoffththe sil uh the people that own it are starting to build it vocnoise 
sil up now but its been like that it was the first apartment community um 
sil vocnoise in columbus it was built in thirty vocnoise sil eight i guess iver 
uhhuh iver uh huh vocnoise and thats what i like about it is the ambience 
and the vocnoise the river and the vocnoise oh oh vocnoise and the apartments are 
just very very plain vocnoise sil and but uh iver its iver it is it 
is its a sil vocnoise sil its kind of a oasis in the middle of 
the city iver so iver vocnoise uh no the only thing vocnoise sil that was 
really down there before i moved out was laughthelincoln leveque tower laugh the shortest one 
laugh laughbut sil vocnoise uh but of course the university is just about the same 
in some ways sil the stadium and all that iver its better in terms of 
the arts iver and theres all kinds of things going on i mean you could 
if you had the laughmoneyyoucoulddosomethingeverynight laugh sil its its better in terms sil of the 
uh vocnoise city government sil seems to the people seem to be more aware of 
what theyre doing and its not vocnoise oh well ill just do this its kind 
of like you know vocnoise theres some brains down there laugh iver laugh iver yeah 
im a democrat and ive never voted for a republican in my life even when 
i lived in oregon vocnoise and i always sil adored mark hatfield laughididntvoteforhimwhileiwasoutthere was the 
weirdest thing vocnoise because i thought he was a great laughrepublican laugh sil but i 
think uh personally mike coleman vocnoise sil was good i vocnoise ive met uh well 
laugh we had a diamond jubilee at the village and vocnoise sil and coleman and 
teater both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of 
a close race i mean i didnt think that cutoffbibig vocnoise there was much that 
much difference in them erroridalogicallyideologically vocnoise i think yknow she would do just about the 
same as he is he might be a little bit better but vocnoise sil um 
sil vocnoise sil i sil in terms of having a black mayor i think thats 
good for columbus sil i cutoffthithink iver i hope so yeah laugh iver hm oh 
thats a real major laughquestionisntit vocnoise uh hm vocnoise sil no i dont think its 
too bad vocnoise i mean vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil well sil uh well we 
could go into the issue of uh sil vocnoise sil the columbus board of education 
whats his name vocnoise he is always iver moss laugh laughbillmoss vocnoise laughhesalwayssaying vocnoise oh 
this is errorrashistracist and thats errorrashistracist but i dont vocnoise think sil vocnoise its too 
bad in columbus vocnoise i know therere places lots errorworthsworse vocnoise like the south and 
so on vocnoise course vocnoise sil uh who who really knows vocnoise sil the race 
issue is such a big question vocnoise iver i like him personally and when he 
was running for uh mayor i would have voted for him i met him and 
everything but i guess he just is vocnoise plays the devils cutoffaadvocate advocate all the 
time at the uh vocnoise sil at the vocnoise sil the um school board meetings 
i i heard this is just a cutoffrumrumor vocnoise sil you want gossip in here 
iver laugh laughyou want some gossip vocnoise the gossip i heard was that um vocnoise 
sil um vocnoise the superintendent of schools said that if laughhewasreelectedshewasgoingtoresignandsotheygaveherabigraise laugh laughsoheshemustbeathorninherside laugh iver 
yeah he was hes gonna always be reelected hes got his cutoffgrgroup vocnoise sil yeah 
laugh iver laugh iver vocnoise iver i sil uh his wifes a teacher and i 
understand an excellent teacher so i think he has real good information vocnoise um sil 
that he works with vocnoise sil well i think she maybe cutoffresresigned sil uh vocnoise 
sil retired last year but she had cutoffa cutoffuh taught vocnoise columbus for twenty years 
or something like that vocnoise sil and so i think his information is good sil 
but i guess laugh laughthe way laughhe handles things sometimes gets laughthroughtopeople laugh iver yeah 
iver umhum iver laugh he always has iver whenever he cutoffrunruns vocnoise sil well i 
thought he was gonna be elected uh sil vocnoise mayor too but he didnt there 
but i dont know what that was about but vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise uh 
vocnoise yknow hes got his errorconstintuatsconstituants and their gonna reelect him because he stands up 
for the minority vocnoise sil i think he what he vocnoise sil makes a mistake 
is saying labeling things racist that are not cutoffnenecessarily sil necessarily racist but anyway iver 
um hum vocnoise sil maybe were beyond that sil we shouldnt vocnoise always be saying 
laughthat laugh iver laugh iver um yeah sil yeah iver well sil um vocnoise sil 
thats i dont know cutoffwhawhat cutoffe cutoffih sil how to explain that laughespeciallyifanybodysgonnalisten to this 
sil um sil i had a friend that taught classes sil human potential classes sil 
was very interested sil and participated very in depth in the human potential movement sil 
so um uh sil a a gentleman by the name of alexander everett sil uh 
who vocnoise really is the father of the human potential movement sil moved out there 
and he was gonna have sil a group of people work out there and uh 
sil and he said that sil yknow i was qualified well when we got out 
there it just fell through sil yknow and we all just lived our lives vocnoise 
but i was glad that sil yknow that he got me out there laughbecauseiadoredit laugh 
i cutoffdjust sil i just loved it out there iver oh its just so cutoffeverytheverything 
the environment of course is sil incredibly beautiful sil um sil and sil everybody is 
more uh sil i think sil more open sil or sil more receptive to relationships 
sil and um sil yknow sil i think its a cutofffriefriendly much friendlier place and 
then uh i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just dont 
have poverty sil well sil if anybodys in poverty in oregon its because theyve chosen 
to live sil a simple life its not a sil yknow because they cant get 
jobs and things like that although the laugheconomyinoregon is not that great but yknow vocnoise 
they say in eugene vocnoise that even the dishwashers have p h ds they laugh 
well the the um vocnoise the level of vocnoise the years of education per capita 
is probably the highest in the country iver so iver yeah they have a lot 
of sil cutoffwwell sil educated people who arent out to just make a bunch of 
money so it sil makes for an very intellectual sil interesting sil environment vocnoise but 
vocnoise people are trying to live simply there sil and i kind of agree with 
that laugh iver oh yeah sil well sil i dont know laugh iver um vocnoise 
iver oh well sil in oregon well sil i was down in california for three 
months and uh sil and uh i went to the cutoffvvegetable sil produce stand and 
i took my umbrella sil and of course it doesnt rain too lauchmuchin laugh laughcalifornia 
sil and i said sil oh im from oregon and i always think its gonna 
rain and he says well im from washington and i know laughitsgonnarain iver laugh but 
uh sil vocnoise sil um sil well somethings happening of course to the planet on 
uh sil weather patterns and uh there been having droughts in oregon which is so 
strange vocnoise but when i was there it sil it um sil it rains from 
november through june it rains i mean cutoffthathey cutoffthethey cutoffthethey cutoffthethey they say on the 
weather in the morning sil showers changing to rain and then laughthenextdaythey say laughrainchangingtoshowers laugh 
laughanditdoeshave vocnoise but they dont use umbrellas i mean they just go through it theyre 
just so used to it and they wear that kind of jacket yknow uh no 
vocnoise because its not a hard rain sil and the first year i was there 
it was pretty hard to get used to it but theres no cold real cold 
winter sil and uh sil and then from sil july sil august september and octobers 
just gorgeous sil just so gorgeous vocnoise but i like sil i like that fog 
and that sil mist and those evergreen laughtrees laugh iver laugh yeah iver it cutoffiis 
sil it is iver laugh iver laugh iver yeah laugh or you could do sil 
the university of oregon its a very nice very small university but its nice sil 
noise iver i forget the name well i dont think theres a university of portland 
but theres two sil two or yes there is a university i cant think of 
which one it is sil right now sil speaking of opinions did you see the 
paper today about the thing in seattle theyre having this big cutoffdre laugh laughbigfights and 
iver its like oh laugh iver laugh iver well i havent read enough to know 
i sil i saw uh sil uh sil uh preliminary thing that they were going 
to protest sil and uh sil but i dont cutoffa im not sil cutoffw informed 
enough to give an opinion laughonthat laugh iver cutoffr i dont cutoffii that cutoffmimight i 
think that that what they were protesting was that they werent cutoffgegetting being cutoffiinvolved involved 
in it wasnt that part of their protest iver they werent being represented sil i 
dont know sil ill have to read sil i didnt read sil paper yet laugh 
iver laugh iver no did you laugh vocnoise sil its probably because put your ad 
it was in the paper in the summer when we werent laughdoinganythingandwantedsomethingtodo laugh iver laugh 
sil now were busy laugh iver oh sil i have just the same opinion i 
think most people have as the tv iver i mean i sil i i mean 
that probably can be proven i dont know if anybody would do any sil decent 
studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that sil yknow it would 
be the influence of tv sil yknow the sil and then sil and vocnoise another 
thing thats sil well tv is the cutoffininfluence sil uh sil where it comes from 
but like the kids are all into pokemon right now iver and it uh they 
have these fads that go through and somebody asked me my opinion about the pokemon 
i said oh brother sil yknow sil it couldnt be any worse than what was 
those turtles that lived in the laughsewers iver cutoffnininja ninja laughturtles sil well the kids 
went into that just so sil cutoffintensivelintensively sil and they were supposed to be real 
good guys but i mean what uh the visual sil was pretty miserable in my 
opinion they wore these masks noise and hoods vocnoise and sil iver sil and they 
fought a lot sil and there was lot of violence sil and then sil i 
love walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i sil 
i swear i havent seen a walt disney movie that doesnt have violence in it 
iver i mean just like beauty and the beast theres extreme amount of violence in 
there sil uh sil yknow just every one theres a cutoffbbad sil a bad dark 
side in the story so sil children just are cutoffsuso and i mean its sil 
in their sil cutoffthethey sil and then sil including my own daughter she sil and 
id swear sil i had her watch mister laughrogersallthetime laugh but cutoffshshe sil now that 
shes older she watches tv sil shes addicted to cutoffdtv sil tv something terrible and 
then so of course her children are sil uh sil so sil but i think 
sil yknow sil i was sil i didnt have laughhave tv when i was a 
child child sil and i think sil yknow it sil it stimulates the imagination in 
some ways but i dont know what direction that imagination really goes yknow sil and 
sil cutoffd but theres a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybodys face anymore 
sil as matter of fact im getting so i dont watch the news iver i 
dislike i cant take any more of it iver laugh i seen this a thousand 
times now people fighting killing this murder that murder sil its like the same thing 
sil over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff 
instead of getting off of it iver laugh iver vocnoise the yeah iver yknow iver 
yeah huh huh huh huh iver yeah sil you sil cutoffi sil cutoffne sil uh 
i sil yknow ive just come to vocnoise i always you know prefer for my 
children noise and noise myself i mean uh if theres anything cutoffddisney sil disney i 
usually go and watch it yknow at the movie theater sil and after a while 
its like sil i think beauty and the beast is where it really came through 
to me its like sil thats a wonderful story but do they have to have 
all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it 
iver and the cutoffwway way disney sells i think is they do have beautiful music 
iver but then cutoffii sil its like it sil some sil evil person back there 
in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle 
sil and then you go you cant stop and not watch that you laughknow you 
cutoffcacant sil and if i was in charge of it id cut some of it 
out its laughnotthatimportant laugh iver laugh iver laugh yeah sil yeah iver cutoffsso sil yeah 
iver um hum cutoffyyeah iver iver iver iver iver no asking each other opinions or 
anything like iver no kind of vocnoise of vocnoise um sil yknow sil uh sil 
it cutoffiit it just seems like our sil uh society just has that sil you 
have to sil be sil just horrible to a person because theyre bad well sil 
you and i know that a bad person doesnt become better by being bad to 
them iver laugh yknow what i cutoffmeamean sil its uh sil i mean vocnoise were 
i hope were getting to the place we know that sil that uh iver wed 
sil we dont necessarily overcome bad by bad were still very much in that framework 
of reference in this sil on this laughparticularplanet laugh iver laugh iver okay noise drooping 
down iver noise okay iver noise im cutofftatalking bouncing around too much iver um hum 
noise yeah iver yeah noise noise okay noise iver vocnoise um sil thats our planet 
iver um hum hum hum iver yeah iver um yeah iver yes iver uh sil 
well im very much sil vocnoise cutoffmmy sil my baseline philosophy is thou shalt not 
kill and that goes really a long ways for me that includes uh vocnoise being 
a vegetarian sil and uh sil um vocnoise sil and sil uh sil most of 
our wars i would have laugh laughsaid laughno laughlets laughnot laughdo laughthis yet sil although 
on the other hand i sil i have to admit that sil there has been 
some stuff that we havent been able to stop without it sil um vocnoise and 
cutoffnathats sil and thats too bad yknow that sil things things are sil have been 
that bad in some sil like sil oh world war two cutoffththe sil i mean 
sil we didnt really have any choice there not that vocnoise but uh sil some 
of the sil some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh sil so but 
sil yknow you can get you can get a philosophy but it doesnt have always 
apply every single vocnoise case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment 
the vocnoise the guy that they um sil uh executed here in ohio last cutoffssummer 
sil fall did you know about it sil you cutoffpprobably if you werent here well 
vocnoise he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in ah sil twenty or 
twentyfive years or something like that and he killed somebody and he was on death 
row and he wanted to be executed vocnoise and i thought thats a copout if 
there ever was one just to sil give him a lethal injection and let him 
go sil he should have rotted in prison for laugh no thats not a punishment 
vocnoise he was off his rocker vocnoise there isnt anybody who murders who isnt insane 
iver yknow technically theres insanity and there isnt insanity but in my opinion there is 
nobody who ever killed anybody who isnt insane sil and uh sil just to sil 
to sil knock them out sil is sil is not appropriate sil they need to 
be sil we need to try to sil save them sil i mean sil not 
in the terms of a christian saving but sil uh sil to make them work 
that off sil and uh sil face it sil and come sil in their sil 
own mind to their own guilt sil and um sil laugh sil um sil so 
sil i got two sides to that once they need to work sil because they 
did it and the other side is sil if we keep uh sil i cutoffa 
sil i believe in the cutoffcacause sil uh cutoffllaw sil uh reincarnation and the law 
of cause and effect sil and if a person murders somebody they need theyll they 
will pay for that later theres no question about that in the next life vocnoise 
but sil also i think that they should be made to face their sil um 
vocnoise their guilt and what theyve done and and sil a lot of them dont 
they say that hardened criminals sil real hard criminals will not ever admit that they 
did anything wrong and they have to they need to iver laugh laughyeah laugh iver 
umhum hum iver umhum iver yeah cutoffwhowhole vocnoise sil well what um what my opinion 
on our whole penal system is just sil yknow sil well it goes along with 
not sil cutoffi kind of neglecting the kids in our schools errortrightright now and were 
definitely cutoffneneglecting sil neglecting criminals they need to have sil be educated and sil and 
worked with sil i mean they need to obviously they some place some point theyve 
sil uh learned sil incorrect sil reasoning or whatever you call it and and they 
need to uh sil they need to have psychological help vocnoise period iver yeah iver 
umhum yeah iver cutoffeevolution iver yeah iver thats where we are in our laughevolutiononthisplanet iver 
laugh vocnoise theres a lot sil we need to do a lot of evolving laugh 
sil we laughdefinitely do iver umhum hum iver laugh iver i dont know uh in 
sil cutoffwewell sil i dont sil uh for a while we got it stopped the 
vocnoise thing that sil is sil uh sil confusing to me sil is that sometimes 
well get something stopped for twenty five sil or sil thirty years or ten or 
fifteen sil and then we go back its like hey we got moved ourselves out 
of that sil why are we going back to it now sil um sil and 
and i think sil yknow the papers keep saying that our cutoffcricriminal vocnoise uh vocnoise 
crime rate is going down and everything sil and so sil uh sil i think 
thats because we sil some people are sil yknow trying to make it vocnoise deal 
with these people as people the who are ill or are sick and try to 
help them with their sil you vocnoise yknow it took us a long time to 
figure out that sil alcoholism is a disease okay and uh so now we try 
to help cutoffaalcoholics alcoholics sil well well sil cutoffug certainly laughmurderingisa laugh iver cutoffdisdisease laughseriousillnessthatneedstobe 
sil helped not extjust yknow sil um sil well stick them in a vocnoise place 
where they can just concentrate on it even more sil so sil we got a 
long ways to go there iver yeah iver um yeah iver yeah anger sil its 
always anger iver vocnoise iver well sil ill have a cutoffr laugh maybe when i 
sil im a hundred ill have that figured out iver because i went to oregon 
sil and of course sil uh vocnoise sil the greater part of the population out 
there are more sil socialists than they are capitalists and theyre easier to deal with 
and theyre more reasonable people in my laughopinionmuchmorereasonable vocnoise but then i come back to 
columbus and all my family and and sil and all sil im the minority in 
my family laugh laughbelieveme laugh and uh sil theyre very in to capitalism and their 
lives are working pretty good for them so noise iver sil so um sil it 
seems sil the picture is kind of vocnoise hard to deal with people that are 
in to capitalism have sil a sil cutoffppretty sil pretty good lives sil and they 
have what they want and they dont uh cutffsseem seem to have such serious problems 
so vocnoise people who try to go against that current can get it theirselves into 
big trouble sil so sil and capitalism has made the united states go i mean 
it has worked sil uh and we are ahead of the world theres no question 
about that and what the individual people sil persons have and how their lives go 
much better sil on the other hand sil um sil yknow im sil im actually 
what i would like sil cutofffofor sil uh sil if it would just spread all 
over the world vocnoise true communism iver true communism sil not as it was practiced 
in russia but sil uh sil where people sil um share and uh sil share 
power and share money and sil equally but with the where we are in our 
evolution that were not ready for it cutoffii laugh actually i cutoffliblived when i was 
in oregon i did a lot of experimenting and i lived in an intentional community 
which was sil actually sil trying iver uh vocnoise to sil cutoffdi we never used 
the word laughever laugh vocnoise but um sil im sure plenty of people used the 
word laughonusyouknow laugh vocnoise but we cutofftrtried uh we shared everything sil that we had 
sil and sil supposedly sil we had a true sil uh sil sharing sil but 
sil um sil in terms of government i dont sil we werent ready for that 
because we had more of a matriarchy sil one woman who was vocnoise decisive and 
made sil decisions and we would laugh laughgoalongwithheryknow vocnoise but um sil if a sil 
if a sil we could get ourselves to the place where it would work sil 
that would be great sil and i would sil very cutoffmumuch and i sil then 
in the year that i lived in that community was one of the cutoffbbest sil 
best years of my life sil it was iver um sil the reason sil that 
it was one of the best years of my life is vocnoise its in a 
cutoffk sil incredibly beautiful setting sil and the people that came to participate in that 
were very very high people sil and it was mostly of course young people but 
they were sil incredibly sil idealistic sil and sil incredibly searching for answers sil in 
sil um sil i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions laugh as 
a matter of fact the thats only thing i errorfeltenfelt sil difficult about sil about 
living there was vocnoise they would be asking all these laughincrediblequestionsandiwouldbe trying to vocnoise laughdothedishesorsomethingmundanelike 
that its like sil i dont want to do the dishes i just want to 
answer the questions vocnoise and the vocnoise um that was sil part of the process 
there to how to work work and work sil up there too with people vocnoise 
but vocnoise if we could just share more vocnoise iver i would be a lot 
happier sil iver mm yeah vocnoise i hope were gonna get there vocnoise laugh vocnoise 
iver errormohoh yeah laugh iver laugh yeah vocnoise yeah iver yeah its gonna have to 
be from the bottom up i think vocnoise and everybody keeps and i cutoffgeget im 
just getting a kick out of all the advertisements and everything theyre coming sil with 
two thousand on it sil well im hoping sil people are making a big deal 
and making a big advertisement and selling a lot of stuff because of it but 
im hoping sil that it sil does mean cutoffpeoppeople since people are so focused on 
it does mean a shift in consciousness i hope sil uh sil y two k 
i dont know what that really stands for laugh i have to think of some 
words there but sil yknow i hope uh since everybody is just sil making it 
into a big deal that maybe it will be a big deal sil yeah iver 
yeah yeah laugh yeah laugh iver oh yeah sil theres always people out there iver 
laugh iver sil actually i wore out iver i sort of wore out sil um 
sil that sil and vocnoise um sil just sil oh there were two reasons i 
left one i was getting sil exhausted sil and uh sil it was just sil 
so demanding sil and sil we didnt know as a community how to let cutoffooff 
sil uh up sil laughsoihadto laugh laughhadto sil i had to withdraw sil another thing 
was sil im very into um sil metaphysics sil and studying and meditating we had 
no time whatsoever everybody was vocnoise in there sil um sil thats one disagreement i 
have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in january so theres always 
people sil coming for sil four sil or five days sil and you have laughtoexplaineverythinginlifetotheminfourorfivedays 
sil and plus we sil uh lived in um sil a sil a rural setting 
where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant sil and a hardware and had 
a mail route sil and then we had all these visitors and then we and 
then we sil uh made our own bread and we sil uh sil milked a 
cow laughanduh laugh so its just cutoffpplain plain sil hard physical work sil plus all 
the mental sil um stuff of dealing with peoples really big questions sil it cutoffwawas 
sil it was laughintense laugh yknow so thats the reason i had to quit is 
was sil like sil if i could sil leave this situation for a month or 
six weeks sil and get caught up within myself sil i would have been okay 
but sil that wasnt how it worked sil so had to sil to pull back 
from it laugh iver uh uh uh sil i have one daughter thirty six years 
old sil she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren iver umhum yeah 
umhum sil yeah iver no not often sil uh my daughter has a very um 
sil intense life laugh and uh sil so um sil i dont see them near 
as often as i like sil right we just do a one day thing sil 
because its fairly easy to drive to toledo so i go sil real early in 
the morning sil and vocnoise uh spend six or seven hours with them and then 
come back sil and or she does the same thing she comes down here sil 
and we just do the one cutoffthithing sil day thing now because of the children 
she worries about the children and blah blah blah laughblahyouknowso sil its better to stick 
sil home sil so i know what theyre doing and everything but i dont sil 
im not noise the old fashioned grandmother iver um sil id like to be yknow 
but she lives i keep telling her laughiwishshed move down here but im not moving 
laughtotoledo laugh i dont like toledo laugh iver uh sil i dont know actually probably 
if i went up there now i would like it but sil um sil but 
its not that i its i dont like it as well as columbus sil at 
all noise sil mainly i suppose because of the university sil unknown iver umhum iver 
ive given you plenty of opinions havent i sil ive just loaded them on you 
sil okay sil i vocnoise i just have a question sil is sil do you 
sil is this a research project for a private organization or is it sil iver 
uh huh iver umhum iver okay sil i bet ill go home and ill wonder 
and wonder and wonder about this iver umhum iver iver sil excludeonetwothreefourfiveonetwothreefourfive sil iver noise 
iver okay iver umhum iver vocnoise iver hesum im originally from columbus sil vocnoise sil 
extand hesum sil im an event coordinator for vocnoise excludename which is exta vocnoise excellent 
caterer sil in german village noise vocnoise hesum sil vocnoise sil im sil forty three

vocnoise for sil vocnoise sil so im really interested in vocnoise horticulture interior design sil 
botany vocnoise hesum sil vocnoise sil but when i did move back from columbus i 
was amazed with all the vocnoise just in a five year span how sil much 
had grown and sil i think its a really vocnoise good city to live in 
i think its really vocnoise progressed well and sil i enjoy living here iver uh 
cutoffssix sil six years ago iver umhum iver five years iver amazing how much the 
growth in delaware and different areas when vocnoise i was growing up here and how 
marysville and it was such a farm sil town vocnoise um just sil the growth 
of the sil different cities and suburbs of sil columbus is amazing and the vocnoise 
housing and iver shopping sil you know sil but its just become a really good 
vocnoise metropolitan city i mean its on its way iver umhum iver vocnoise yep iver 
vocnoise now with easton i think its really helped vocnoise with columbus and vocnoise yknow 
i think its just gonna get better and better iver yeah iver vocnoise yes iver 
umhum iver columbus needs that as much people dont want other things to close i 
just feel we have to keep sil we have to grow those people have to 
travel so far to shop and vocnoise yknow sil i dont think thats sil really 
fair to them iver hm iver oh yeah thats beautiful sil yeah iver its nice 
they have a real nice arts festival every spring sil if you ever get a 
chance go down in march iver its right on their main sil street and cutoffnahthey 
they have gorgeous vocnoise really neat sil unique things iver umhum its real well known

which makes it interesting iver oh yeah vocnoise umhum vocnoise its the biggest thing iver 
yes vocnoise umhum iver you know what vocnoise um vocnoise actually vocnoise i dont believe 
they have anything booked so far lot of times i think this year people are 
more going out rather vocnoise than having people come in to their homes and things 
vocnoise ive usually ive worked for sil different hotels where ive always worked on new 
years eve vocnoise and my husband this year is like yknow sil but we dont 
even have any plans noisewe were gonna maybe do vocnoisesomething with vocnoisesome friends and theyre 
going to california so im not sure vocnoise even exactly what im gonna do but 
sil hesum sil right now theres not an event scheduled iver which could change noise 
iver they are but the seems like theyre going out vocnoise yeah instead of having 
vocnoise we dont do things in hotels and things because they have in house iver 
yknow iver yes private homes and um actually sil where i worked theres not a 
facility iver for parties vocnoise so because its actually a market vocnoise its all done 
outside like tonight were going to the uh galberth pavilion which is vocnoise um vocnoise 
next to the ohio theater vocnoise its really beautiful and people do a lot of 
parties there iver yeah iver yeah it is i like it iver hesum iver i

things vocnoise lot more than they did lets say ten years vocnoiseago iver yeah vocnoise 
umhum iver vocnoise uh sil actually he sil um sil in the fifties he had 
a jazz club vocnoise and sil um sil it was real popular vocnoise it had 
food and live music um peggy lee sang noisethere and vocnoise some kind of sil 
name vocnoise people i wasnt around but laugh um vocnoise and also he had a 
private club thats um sil it was similar to the bunny club it was the 
key club where people had to pay a membership vocnoise and it was in a 
real sil nice uh area downtown exthere vocnoise and hes extalso uh hesowned um hes 
hesa sil hes a broker sil he vocnoisesells sil liquor licenses and things so vocnoise

vocnoise i never felt vocnoise they were the right one iver and i did have 
a very serious relationship in florida vocnoise uh he was quite a bit younger than

decided i never wanted children and i knew vocnoise he eventually would so vocnoise uh 
vocnoise i was engaged to him but i decide to iver break it off because

sil women sil are more powerful and i think they theyre finally making yknow good 
money and vocnoise used to be women needed men to take care of them vocnoise

am i ever gonna meet anybody and vocnoise all my friends honestly vocnoise most of 
them were all noisemarried vocnoise but um vocnoise i enjoyed being single vocnoise and i 
never really felt the vocnoise the urge just to get married to get married vocnoise

kentucky and west virginia seems girls down there sil a lot them get married so

of animals vocnoise sil vocnoise than children i dont know why sil i knew at 
a very young age sil that i vocnoise wasnt important to me it wouldnt be 
a part of my life sil iver they wouldnt sil no sil i noise went 
to two different sil doctors and they said vocnoise sil you possibly will change your 
mind and sil yknow i was single sil um maybe if i would have been 
married they might have vocnoise considered it vocnoise sil um sil but sil they vocnoise 
sil said no way would they do it sil and were talking fifteen years ago 
iver yeah iver isnt that amazing iver yeah iver right iver vocnoise iver well it 
probably would have been sil yeah sil but they felt that i would change sil 
vocnoise sil and uh sil ive also been a vegetarian for twenty two years vocnoise 
sil and when i first decided to do that everyone said oh youll sil change 
wait until you get married youll you know and i dont eat any animals at 
all sil vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil and its sil it was just a conscious 
vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil decision iver sil im sil i never liked meat my 
parents always made me eat it once i went away to college vocnoise sil and 
i said im im not going to eat anymore and theyre like oh sil well 
well see sil and vocnoise sil ive never eat sil noise eaten noise anything since 
iver sil and vocnoise sil ive always felt good about it sil vocnoise sil but 
sil people always said sil vocnoise oh you dont even crave yknow what like a 
wendys hamburger and all this stuff vocnoise sil and once you make a decision like 
that you dont crave things like that you dont even sil think about it iver 
sil um sil and i yknow they said well what if uh sil for health 
reason they said youd have to eat meat theres no way someone could tell me 
sil vocnoise sil that i would have to eat meat sil sil yknow iver to 
make me healthier or whatever because ive always been really healthy iver umhum sil iver 
umhum sil iver umhum sil iver umhum iver right iver there is iver there didnt 
used to be and especially in restaurants and everything and now its such an open 
market and they know that they have to sil vocnoise sil accommodate sil every um 
sil vocnoise sil bodys taste sil yknow i mean before no id have to go 
in to a restaurant and vocnoise sil vocnoise sil salad and baked potato yknow i 
mean there was nothing sil vocnoise really nothing unless i go to a buffet and 
then all the vocnoise sil foods so cooked down i mean honestly vocnoise yknow its 
like no nutritional value vocnoise iver but um iver vocnoise no i knew i wouldnt 
change my mind on that either im pretty sil vocnoise sil strong willed about noise 
laughthings laugh iver oh yeah vocnoise and you know what i cook meat for my 
husband sil i really dont cook sil red meat vocnoise sil because hes on the 
road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places vocnoise sil 
um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups sil a lot 
of good soups for him with meat vocnoise sil and it really doesnt bother me 
to cook it sil yknow im not go sit home make a roast every night 
iver but um sil vocnoise sil and hes limited his meat a little bit more 
but with men its a lot harder vocnoise sil i think sil yknow when theyre 
vocnoise used to you vocnoise sil meat and potato kind of families sil vocnoise sil 
um vocnoise sil but like thanksgiving it just doesnt mean that much to me sil 
i sil i the family thing does but yknow the turkey vocnoise laughandallthat sil we 
i dont cook it very often my sister we used to go to my sisters 
iver house sil because she enjoys cooking and sil makes it a little bit easier 
i tend to overcook the meat sil laugh iver you know i havent vocnoise sil 
yeah sil i havent tried that sil no sil no i eat tofu a little 
bit but not really that much and i probably cutoffsitshould sil should ive vocnoise sil 
um sil tended to more to soy products vocnoise sil and theres so much nutritional 
value and especially for women sil yknow i think its sil iver really sil umhum 
sil i think its really good for women to learn about this we should have 
known about this twenty years ago sil vocnoise sil all these women sil i know 
sil vocnoise iver umhum iver umhum iver right iver right iver umhum sil and they 
should sil and very rarely do doctors even ask you about allergies vocnoise sil and 
i vocnoise sil more and more and people dont even realize and they get sick 
so often sil vocnoise sil they need to ask about allergies sil vocnoise or even 
just have a little minor test that they can take sil when people when they 
cant figure out whats wrong with them sil vocnoise sil because a lot of times 
it is allergic reactions to things theyve eaten sil iver sil or been around sil 
you know but um sil more sil i think doctors should more sil vocnoise sil 
look on that avenue sil yknow sil that possibly its something else like that sil 
ive never had a doc well now with the forms you fill out with your 
physicians and they ask you sil vocnoise sil if you know about allergies and usually 
its um vocnoise sil vocnoise sil prescriptions and things sil you know i mean that 
youve taken but sil they vocnoise i dont know i think a lot of things 
have to do with food allergies anymore vocnoise sil i really do vocnoise sil iver 
yep sil vocnoise sil well for so long i sil ate peanuts and i loved 
them and peanut butter and then two years ago i started getting a reaction from 
it sil vocnoise sil and um sil finally i did go to the doctor because 
i vocnoise sil i sil i was so ill from it sil vocnoise sil um 
and he said youre allergic sil um vocnoise mainly it was the skins on sil 
like spanish peanuts and things sil vocnoise sil and i never but sil my body 
must have built up sil this reaction to it because i i was always fine 
eating them sil vocnoise sil and then they really sil turned on me so now 
i cant even eat sil any vocnoise sil peanut products sil vocnoise sil or the 
oil because everybodys like well you can eat natural peanut butter and im like sil 
no its the oil in there you know they grind up the peanuts and its 
the oil vocnoise sil but vocnoise um vocnoise sil vocnoise sil i probably had it 
for a long time and i was sil getting sick and thinking i had the 
flu or something and he iver yknow i didnt realize because i used to love 
peanut butter sil vocnoise you want toast and crackers id go home you know was 
vocnoise because it was a lot of protein for me not eating meat and it 
sil yknow it kind of satisfied me vocnoise sil vocnoise sil but um vocnoise this 
doctor vocnoise sil vocnoise sil took a couple tests sil and um vocnoise sil he 
realized it was the peanuts which i would have never thought of that sil because 
i ate it for so long sil all my life iver yes iver umhum iver 
see and i cant eat seafood unknown but i sil tried some once when i 
went to las vegas with my sil vocnoise sil and i sil we didnt really 
have it sil my mom didnt cook it at home sil which im kind glad 
she didnt sil um sil the sil smell of fish always kind of bothered me 
sil vocnoise sil but vocnoise until i tried some crab meat and lobster vocnoise sil 
and within five minutes sil i broke out into a rash sil i mean it 
was like a heat rash vocnoise noise vocnoise oh sil it started on my neck 
sil iver laugh iver is it okay im sorry vocnoise iver noise iver sil iver

know until you get a reaction like that iver vocnoise sil no i had a 
cat that just died iver vocnoise yeah iver vocnoise sixteen iver yeah iver umhum iver

that and with a cat and they curl up with you sil its hard to

have to admit cutoffeh sil when we go to try play golf sometimes vocnoise sil 
and not have a tee noise time you cant even get in iver so all 
over columbus theyre all booked iver and so you keep thinking well sil yknow they 
need more but vocnoise sil i was hoping they could use that land for something 
else vocnoise i dont know sil theres sil yknow theres so many sil not building 
but sil yknow something maybe sil especially in dublin vocnoise but vocnoise sil vocnoise its 
hesi hesits probably itll be good for columbus iver because i unknownf sil they feel 
they vocnoise have the need for it sil theres so many golfers i mean that 
sports vocnoise sil went sky high unknown mean when hesi sil vocnoise sil my mom 
used to play golf vocnoise growing up and they only let them on laughthe laughgolf 
laughcourse just one day a week vocnoise sil which is amazing sil vocnoise sil was 
like on a tuesday vocnoise sil and when i lived in florida a lot of 
the courses were like that too and i thought vocnoise sil theyre only allowing women 
one day a week sil vocnoise yknow vocnoise isnt that amazing sil theres so many 
good women golfers now and but they said theyre too slow and they always talk 
and vocnoise sil and that just killed me when my mom thats the only day 
she could play and she wanted to play more iver laughyknow vocnoise sil so things 
have come a little bit noise yknow noise sil better but um sil theres still 
such restrictions with women sil iver yknow in this sport especially i think golf sil 
iver umhum iver right iver right iver you cant noise no sil umhum iver right 
sil iver vocnoise it is sil but it it that was good for sil new 
albany to have that i mean i think it sil it was great to have 
it there and i think a lot of people sil vocnoise sil um sil did 
enjoy going there because theres not very many women tournaments that come sil around here 
iver yeah iver yes sil mmhmm vocnoise yep iver no iver sil mmhmm iver vocnoise 
right iver yep iver vocnoise oh sil wow sil iver umhum iver wow sil iver 
cutoffwwell yeah iver no i cutoffhahad we actually had student tickets that sil people didnt 
want clear up in c deck sil um noise sil vocnoise but we enjoy it 
because heswe lot times we walk and iver sil um sil i think i was 
at that penn state game i have a vocnoise extcousin is a golf pro over 
sil near sil penn state iver vocnoise trying think the name of it sil um 
sil but he usually gets us tickets for that game iver yeah sil mmhmm but 
ive never been to happy valley ive always sil wanted to go ive heard its 
so nice vocnoise sil and you extknow sil noise theyre such good people every time 
they come here to ohio state though they were very sil you know high class 
people and vocnoise sil a year that we just noise killed them here i think 
it was sil three years ago and but they were vocnoise yknow i mean though 
sil vocnoise they just seem very gracious because iver i think their coach is the 
best joe paterno is the best sil iver i do hes a iver he is 
iver he is iver mmhmm iver john no iver he hes a very hes a 
disappointment iver and vocnoise i iver think the laughmain problem with this year was the 
coaching its good that they got rid of two coaches but vocnoise his attitude i 
just dont think the kids sil think of him as a role model and i 
think a coach has to be a role model vocnoise i used to work at 
the hyatt sil on capitol square iver and thats where vocnoise the ohio state players 
noise i dont know if you know this laugh vocnoise they stay there every night 
before a game sil i mean its the most expensive hotel in columbus vocnoise all 
the players stay there but sil to my amazement they come down for a uh 
vocnoise i think they have a dinner then they come down for a midnight snack 
its so funny all these guys come down in their shorts and stuff iver to 
get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice vocnoise but noise but then 
here comes sil the uh coopers wife sil and his daughter sil and like his 
son and im noisethinking noise theyre putting cutoffahall sil all these his family up in 
this hotel the noisenight before a game i mean vocnoise i dont know i just 
thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with 
him when all sil none of those boys get to bring anybody you know what 
i mean iver and none of the other coaches did either iver vocnoise um sil 
but i just thought it and here they came down for the midnight snack too 
sil and i thought sil this is for the sil team sil you know what 
i mean iver i thought it was very strange sil but um iver he seems 
pretty arrogant i dont think hes done noise very noisereally too much for columbus sil 
they need to get a younger coach they need sil vocnoise a new iver they 
do because he just sil hes all out for noisehimself iver i just really think 
he is iver yeah iver i know it iver and then the players said were 
not getting any guidance from the coaches iver you know and they some of them 
vocnoise spoke out where they should speak out iver yknow sil mean i liked earl 
bruce sil and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i 
worked at vocnoise he was the nicest man and when they did that i dont 
know if you know about that when they vocnoise fired him the day before the 
michigan game vocnoise for having a nine to three season three years in a row 
vocnoise they fired him the day before that game iver and then but the whole 
band and the cheerleaders went to his house vocnoise and he came out crying i 
mean it was on tv it was like heart wrenching iver and because of that 
sil the um vocnoise um vocnoise athletic director that was here at the time sil 
he quit noise because he did not want to fire them and they overruled him 
iver but iver the city just could not believe iver that they fired him like 
that the night before the vocnoise michigan game vocnoise so then the next day he 
came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora yknow a hat 
vocnoise he looked so cool vocnoise yknow because joe paterno he always wears a tie 
i dont know he just sil he hes a great coach iver yknow not that 
what you wear makes you but he just vocnoise hes a good role model iver 
cooper just vocnoise i just dont see him ever vocnoise hugging the guys or saying 
great job or anything vocnoise you know iver right iver yeah noise iver umhum iver 
well the main thing is sil they never leave sil they dont they go a 
lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest sil 
g p a of any college iver i mean that is an iver that is 
an embarrassment for a college this size iver and they have excellent iver professors and 
everything vocnoise but i think sil yknow they get a lot of these kids and 
they dont care about school sil but they vocnoise they leave early vocnoise because they 
know they can do it iver and thats so sad for our city iver it 
really is iver yknow iver umhum iver umhum iver oh yeah iver and these guys 
have a free ride and then they just leave on it iver i know iver 
i think they should too sil i do sil i noisereally do vocnoise i mean 
vocnoise sil and youre right thats not fair because then thats sil thats a waste 
iver um because there is some good athletes you look at colleges especially on the 
west coast like stamford i have a friend whos sil from california iver his dads 
a sil um sil a graduate of stanford vocnoise um vocnoise but he is um 
sil they they never leave there i mean thats an excellent medical school and everything 
but those football players theyre smart they they dont sil they dont quit sil yknow 
sil i mean its amazing they vocnoise they never do iver because they like it 
they like school and thats why they came to college football was secondary iver but 
here vocnoise its just to see yknow vocnoise how much sil success you can have 
and then vocnoise they just want to leave vocnoise but sil we looked we can 
look forward to the basketball season i think hes a good coach iver we needed 
that iver umhum iver yeah that was very exciting iver umhum iver vocnoise yeah i 
think it was iver right iver umhum iver yeah iver i know laugh iver well 
because sil yknow iver but then they have one injury sil and then sil what 
are they going to do noise and they got to think of that sil they 
have a free sil education and they just dont think of it that way sil 
yknow they think they can make enough money vocnoise but vocnoise yknow iver moneys not 
everything vocnoise its too bad sports have vocnoise ended up this way iver it does 
iver umhum iver umhum iver i know iver umhum iver vocnoise iver well sil i 
think all through growing up theres always been sil yknow sil different kind of kids 
iver i mean theres always been the nerds and sil um vocnoise sil i dont 
know when i was growing up vocnoise in the seventies sil there really wasnt sil 
punk or anything like that sil and sil i think um sil unfortunately sil i 
mean theres always going to be all different kinds of people sil to make the 
world but sil it they just sil pushed you to an extreme vocnoise certain sil 
kinds of kids and yknow sil they want a sil i saw vocnoise yknow i 
watch all these shows dateline and twenty twenty and all this informative shows sil and 
how one was sil in texas run over sil one of the punk kids was 
run over by a sil um sil a jock iver i mean actually run over 
and killed iver um in a fight sil and they just said that we wanna 
be vocnoise um vocnoise looked at as just sil other sil kids yknow in high 
school sil but yet when they wear make up and they spike their hair vocnoise 
and they have all these piercings sil yknow its like they cutoffnah vocnoise they dont 
want to be like everybody else iver yknow they want to be judged as like 
everybody else vocnoise but vocnoise sil yknow i think um sil they have so many 
different ideas vocnoise and not that either one of thems right but still um sil 
i vocnoise i think theres always going to barrier there sil theyre just kids are 
just not all kids are going to get along vocnoise yknow sil i mean iver 
iver iver i think because sil of the movies vocnoise and i think of vocnoise 
nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does 
vocnoise spark things in little sil childrens minds and even yknow like in junior high 
that oh yeah we could do that sil yknow and vocnoise theres just so much 
violence sil in sil when we were growing up there wasnt any violence vocnoise on 
tv we werent allowed to watch it sil but yknow i mean i noisemean the 
comics werent violent um sil now its too open for kids the parents sil yknow 
they say the parents should monitor vocnoise them sil cutoffchwatch on tv and in the 
movies iver that sil that is whats making the sil these kids think they sil 
they can do it sil i just really think iver i think its too late 
sil i do noise sil i iver personally i think its too late sil because 
sil they can get things on the internet vocnoise yknow theres just so many things 
sil so many vocnoise avenues for them sil to sil find sil violence and pornography 
and yknow hesthings sil things that sil we vocnoise sil yknow vocnoise when i was 
growing up sil we just sil there was no way i could sil see any 
of that stuff i had good parents but i sil i was in to sil 
yknow sil lassie and tom and jerry i mean yknow these but yknow they werent 
violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but hesi sil i 
just think sil i dont think it could vocnoise sil turn back vocnoise right now 
vocnoise i dont know iver theres just too much diversity iver in the world iver 
and too much prejudice sil there really is still and its sad but sil it 
there really is iver yep sil i do sil i really do vocnoise i mean 
these kids are getting guns a lot of thems from their parents but vocnoise um 
sil its amazing how many guns and they say that vocnoise the police are selling 
guns sil to people and they dont realize sil yknow their old guns that they 
confiscate and they dont realize where theyre going i mean that amazes me sil um 
vocnoise but theres always gonna be sil the underworld and vocnoise different sil ways that 
kids and people can get guns sil and its sad i dont know how we 
could ever sil limit that but sil theres so many millions of sil guns in 
the world that vocnoise yknow sil youre wondering where are they all coming from sil 
um sil i think vocnoise but i think laws can help especially with children and 
they have these new vocnoise guns that vocnoise um sil not just a safety lock 
but sil yknow you vocnoise its like identification thing sil yknow iver only the erroronlyerowner 
can do it i mean sil seems like with all the technology in the world 
they should be able to do something like that vocnoise the people who have guns 
and sil in their home and not have them sil locked up or in a 
vocnoise yknow in a vocnoise sil place that no child could find it sil theyre 
to blame sil they are theyre to blame sil um sil that whole thing with 
the um sil vocnoise vocnoise school out in colorado sil um sil i forget the 
name of it but vocnoise yeah sil but when they said that those boys were 
making those guns in the garage and the parents didnt vocnoise were clueless i just 
find that really hard to believe sil if a child goes in to a garage 
every night and you hear clanging and sil and theyre buying gun metal and sil 
yknow vocnoise sil then they were totally sil um sil not in tune with what 
their kids were doing sil its one thing them having a site on the internet 
iver its another thing that theyre in their own sil in the house where the 
parents are every night vocnoise and not going in to the garage and finding things 
iver i just cant believe and they said they didnt even know what was going 
on iver it is iver um sil iver i do because they werent sil yknow 
they werent sil in their sil childrens lives enough sil you know they werent talking 
about things being open about things at dinner sil yknow finding out about school sil 
um sil i cutoffkihcant you cant blame them for having a site on the internet 
not too many vocnoise sil parents would know that that they their kids yknow sil 
um sil vocnoise sil but no i think i i i put the blame on 
the parents iver i do i think sil they vocnoise sil yknow if youre open 
with your kids nowadays you have to be with sil everything thats in the world 
sil mean my parents never talked to me about drugs or anything iver and it 
was just when sil vocnoise the drug culture was just sil yknow starting we learned 
about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me 
sil or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but sil today with teenagers 
and everything so out in the open sil you have to talk to them about 
things and just say vocnoise you know sil i want to help you and i 
sil yknow be there for them a hundred percent obviously sil those parents were to 
busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing sil so i 
think theyre the ones to be sil to blame i do iver yeah sil not 
that they could have stopped it but they sil they should have known what was 
going on sil uh i really think sil if they were close with their children 
they would have known sil something was wrong sil especially with these kids sil here 
are so removed and sil dont talk to their parents and start dressing sil certain 
ways sil you know that theyre sil yknow going a sil turning a different laugh 
sil yknow sil i just sil i blame them though iver umhum iver but they 
lived in a beautiful home sil i mean if youre to vocnoise sil i mean 
vocnoise kids like that i could see sil if theyre sil in a sil poor 
in harlem or whatever sil but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood in a 
beautiful home in colorado i mean yknow sil i just think they were sil removed 
from what their children sil or their son was doing iver totally iver yeah sil 
i dont think that though yknow women need to work sil and sil most families 
do need two incomes vocnoise um sil and sil plus when kids go into high 
school vocnoise sil you know you have noise pardon me you have to worry about 
them but sil yknow you sil you have to let them experience some of life 
sil on their own iver thats a big growing period yknow from junior high to 
high school is when you really sil learn and try to decide what you want 
to do with your life sil um sil my mother was always home she was 
sil um sil which was good to come home to because i had friends sil 
whose parent mothers werent there and they had to clean and they had to start 
dinner and they hated it yknow i mean and they sil feel that they kind 
of vocnoise sil missed out on things sil um sil but sil i think sil 
yknow kids sil lot of them who have sil when they vocnoise parents have money 
sil and um sil both parents worked im not sure if the columbine sil if 
both parents worked but sil i dont think sil just the mother being home there 
sil would have totally helped sil no iver umhum iver umhum iver well sil i 
dont think they should be responsible i think sil um sil kids go to school 
sil and they need role models good teachers sil um sil and i think schools 
have gotten a lot vocnoise better about that it seemed like in the vocnoise sil 
late eighties early nineties yknow the schools sil a lot of them were really bad 
sil um sil i think sil finally sil the education sil department or whatever is 
sil realizing that sil parents need help with their kids they cant noise do everything 
and sil yknow they just need really positive things when they do go to school 
sil and sil yknow i think teachers are a big part of it vocnoise i 
really do sil yknow you remember when you have a good teacher and that youve 
learned a lot sil um and i think sil yknow through education sil because its 
hard all these schools in so many rural areas and everything sil try to get 
good teachers and then vocnoise yknow its always have to do with money and them 
not vocnoise making enough money which sil the teachers dont make enough money sil and 
theyre overworked and all these big large classrooms sil and it just seems to me 
sil when kids start sil dressing and vocnoise sil getting in a clique together sil 
yknow would be hard for them to vocnoise intervene and hessay say oh whats going 
on in your life whats your vocnoise whats the problem you know thats sil thats 
not really sil should be their role sil but vocnoise um sil if they care 
enough they should call the parents and say unknown look were worried about your son 
sil he misses lot of school or hes starting to dress really sil ynkow sil 
vocnoise i sil sometimes and it shouldnt be that dress sil has a lot to 
do with it but it seems when kids sil go a different way sil it 
does involve dress sil and sil just sil yknow sil turning against the norm of 
the society sil yknow noise sil and if they dont want to be in sports 
thats fine there are so many different things they can do in sil in school 
and learn about arts and music and vocnoise yknow sil but sil um sil unfortunately 
a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools sil to more or 
less pick up the slack sil of what sil the parents cant do sil but 
in some ways sil its always kind of been like that i mean it was 
like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home 
sil yknow sil i mean iver well iver right sil right iver i think it 
would help sil i do sil i am against religion in school sil i just 
dont think sil they should push that on people iver um sil yknow sil i 
mean i dont think they should make people pray if they dont want to before 
class or anything yknow like that sil but as far as morals and the right 
sil thing to do in life and sil whats out there and sil yknow most 
kids know what the wrong thing is but iver um sil i think sil i 
think through education sil thats sil its just gonna only help sil kids because a 
lot times maybe they dont get that at home sil so theyre really looking sil 
to choose the right thing to do help iver i do sil vocnoise sil i 
am against religion in school sil i just dont think sil they should push that 
on people sil vocnoise um sil you know vocnoise sil i mean i dont think 
they should make people pray if they dont want to before class or anything sil 
yknow like that vocnoise but as far as morals and the right sil thing to 
do in life and vocnoise sil whats out there and sil yknow most kids know 
what the wrong thing is but iver um sil vocnoise sil i think vocnoise i 
think through education vocnoise sil thats sil its just gonna sil only help iver kids 
because a lot times maybe they dont get that at home vocnoise so theyre really 
looking sil to choose the right thing to do vocnoise and through school and cutoffclippingword 
through education vocnoise thats their avenue to go there iver yknow vocnoise so unfortunately sil 
yknow and i guess i never thought of it vocnoise a lot more pressure is 
put on vocnoise schools and education now sil iver yknow vocnoise sil and these schools 
that have a thousand people i just cant imagine sil i mean yknow my my 
high school was like sil four hundred people and we sil thought that was sil 
vocnoise big at the time vocnoise and just to have a thousand cutoffpeepeople noise excuse 
sil me people and sil just to vocnoise sil try to monitor different things i 
mean its gotta be so sil hard vocnoise sil you know sil in checking everything 
and iver yknow iver i just think its sad even here in columbus yknow like 
two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools noise and 
i thought sil yknow vocnoise sil i just sil yknow it just could because sil 
of all the things youve seen in the world sil in the last few year 
vocnoise that these kids want to do this just to see sil whats gonna happen 
iver vocnoise yknow its its just sad sil in our society that thats what its 
sil turning to iver i went to brook haven sil which is uh sil up 
on karl road vocnoise sil near northland mall vocnoise sil iver sil yep sil iver 
vocnoise sil yes sil i do iver umhum sil iver umhum iver well vocnoise honestly 
growing up sil we didnt have we sil it wasnt really called sex ed sil 
vocnoise sil um sil they talked about the female reproductive system sil nothing about men 
which is kind of funny sil yknow it was always the women sil and that 
chart yknow iver and those sil tubes and all that i mean i remember seeing 
that like in eighth grade and looking that thinking thats me yknow iver sil um 
iver but with sil kids and theyre just so much sil more sil active at 
a early age iver sil yknow and i hear about kids sil twelve cutoffththird thirteen 
laugh sil luckily i wasnt that early vocnoise sil but um vocnoise sil i think 
sil once they start sil yknow like sixth grade they really sil should relate to 
them sil iver um iver sil i sil think thats too young to talk about 
birth control methods and everything but vocnoise sil yknow with aids and that as sil 
rampant it is is now and sil vocnoise sil there are so many more women 
that have it sil um started off it was mostly men vocnoise sil um sil 
women have got to know sil as cutoffahat at an early age sil yknow sil 
about these different diseases and things iver and i think that sil um vocnoise the 
morals being vocnoise yknow sil especially sil at a young age yknow abstinence is the 
best policy vocnoise so many people sil i sil i sil think they are vocnoise 
turning to theyre not gonna noise have any vocnoise noise thing laugh do anything before 
theyre married um vocnoise but in todays life noise once you get in to college 
and stuff its a little hard to vocnoise but i think a lot more kids 
are going vocnoise that route vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise sil because my sil parents 
never talked to me about sex vocnoise we all learned it from our friends vocnoise 
um vocnoise my mother was very open noise but i think in todays world vocnoise 
because really there wasnt sil noise there wasnt that many sil diseases sil i mean 
vocnoise yknow there was but vocnoise you just didnt hear about it iver and the 
pregnancies and all the unwanted children and everything like that vocnoise sil um vocnoise i 
just heard this week that in france they have vocnoise uh that morning after pill 
iver and you know i just really think they need to make that vocnoise and 
not sil uh vocnoise an option sil for a young girl vocnoise i really do 
because theres just vocnoise yknow vocnoise noise theres just too many unwanted children noise there 
just is and that really bothers me sil that we dont have another option vocnoise 
sil like another sil country vocnoise um sil were a lot more right wing here 
in america sil vocnoise sil but vocnoise i just feel thats got to be an 
option noise yknow for these young girls vocnoise it just really does vocnoise iver right 
sil iver right iver well iver but i sil think it should be an option 
vocnoise you know im really sil you know for womens right and everything because i 
was single for so long vocnoise and sil i just feel sil if a man 
could have a child vocnoise sil it would be different but since women are the 
only ones that can vocnoise then its sil ultimate sil ultimately should be our choice 
sil i really do sil and i think sil vocnoise sil you know we should 
have every option available vocnoise sil especially when youre young sil no girl should have 
to go through sil you know sil pregnancy and everything even if its a mistake 
or whatever i just sil you know sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil it ruins their 
lives vocnoise sil when they dont have the option vocnoise iver right iver sil iver 
well sil i think at that age the sil parents should be involved sil and 
hopefully theyll be open minded enough to know that this is going to be something 
shes going to have the rest of her life vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise ill 
tell you what with todays sil world sil and some of these fourteen year olds 
vocnoise sil that look like theyre twenty vocnoise sil and sil you know sil they 
sil they know what theyre doing sil and no they shouldnt keep sil repeating that 
sil um vocnoise noise sil i just think sil the most important thing is is 
for them to be able to have the option sil i really do sil vocnoise 
but yes the parents should be involved id say to the age sil seventeen maybe 
sil vocnoise sil you know i sil think they should have a sil parents consent 
and hopefully vocnoise the parents will love their daughter enough to realize sil vocnoise sil 
vocnoise what a sil mistake its going to be if sil shes gonna be young 
mother and then sil vocnoise sil eventually maybe not even want to be a mother 
vocnoise yknow sil i mean sil vocnoise theres a lot of girls that have those 
babies and then they just sil they kill them vocnoise sil vocnoise yknow and theres 
so much that sil vocnoise for a while there that was going on and its 
like you sil i cant believe these women are doing this vocnoise sil yknow sil 
vocnoise sil they just snap sil laugh sil iver sil iver vocnoise iver well vocnoise 
sil ill be honest vocnoise sil i have a lot of homosexual friends vocnoise sil 
and sil being in the restaurant business and vocnoise sil growing up in the restaurant 
business and thats how i vocnoise sil really kind of sil vocnoise met them sil 
vocnoise sil when i was going to school i didnt know any vocnoise sil and 
i went to o u and honestly down there i didnt know sil i didnt 
know anybody was gay vocnoise sil um sil i feel vocnoise sil that sil a 
lot of people were ill say vocnoise sil most of them sil or all of 
them sil are born that way vocnoise sil vocnoise some of them do make a 
choice vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil but i sil feel that vocnoise it should be 
vocnoise sil talked about in school vocnoise um for so long sil vocnoise sil it 
was in the closet laugh sil yknow they didnt talk about it and these kids 
yknow sil vocnoise had to hide it and i just think in todays world and 
theres so many people that are openly gay vocnoise sil that vocnoise sil it should 
be talked about more in school sil i do sil i think vocnoise sil yknow 
sil especially vocnoise sil i just think some vocnoise and women sil theres sil women 
that sil you know i had sil my gym teacher brook haven now that i 
look at it vocnoise i didnt know then vocnoise but she was gay vocnoise i 
mean we didnt sil i didnt think that then i dont know why but she 
was very manly but she was very vocnoise she was very good but she was 
vocnoise you know just sil not sil feminine at all iver and not that that 
changed my opinion of her vocnoise um vocnoise but sil back then and nobody would 
talk about it sil and sil yknow vocnoise sil i just think sil in todays 
world sil we need to bring vocnoise sil subjects like that out vocnoise sil no 
one sil vocnoise because theres so many people who are ashamed about sil things vocnoise 
sil and they shouldnt be ashamed because its a lifestyle anymore vocnoise yknow vocnoise i 
just sil it needs to be brought up more vocnoise iver yeah iver well iver 
umhum iver well but see i think if you sil really try to tell sil 
kids and especially women vocnoise sil that vocnoise yknow you shouldnt sil sex is something 
that sil should be between two people that love each other vocnoise sil and unless 
you really sil vocnoise sil feel love and really sil think sil it is love 
then sil yknow sil you shouldnt do it iver um i know thats a lot 
easier said than done vocnoise because sil you fall in love every other week sometimes 
when youre young vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil but i dont think it encourages it 
noise i just think in sil you know they show so much on t v 
its all yknow people are sil nude on at ten o clock at night on 
these shows vocnoise sil and these girls are watching it vocnoise i mean granted most 
of them are adults sil but on the soap operas and stuff its a different 
story vocnoise so theyre seeing it anyways vocnoise sil um sil noise sil you just 
i think if youre open enough with your children these parents vocnoise sil and say 
you know we cutoffwwant sil we want to give you this option we really vocnoise 
sil prefer you dont do this but if you decide to do it we want 
you to be protected iver i mean i think thats the best way to noise 
address it vocnoise sil and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids 
who sil say well maybe im gay i dont know if im gay or what 
vocnoise well vocnoise hopefully sil theyll know sil their true identity sil eventually vocnoise iver 
i mean yes some people sil vocnoise um vocnoise you just i think if youre 
open enough with your children these parents vocnoise and say you know we cutoffwwant sil 
we want to give you this option we really prefer you dont do this vocnoise 
but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected iver i 
mean i think thats the best way to noise address it vocnoise and as far 
as the homosexual i think there is kids who sil say well maybe im gay 
i dont know if im gay or what sil well sil hopefully sil theyll know 
sil their true identity vocnoise eventually sil i mean yes some people vocnoise i mean 
i know men vocnoise several men who got married had children and then they noise 
decided they were gay vocnoise okay were they gay before but they did like women 
iver yknow and they did want the children iver and now sil they live vocnoise 
in gay relationships iver but they said all along sil they were gay sil they 
just fought it sil and they they didnt want the pressure from their families iver 
so sil ah sil you noise know vocnoise i vocnoise i just think the more 
youre open about things vocnoise i just think thats the best why it sil yknow 
vocnoise when you put things and dont talk about it thats when the problems start 
iver but i think kids in high school and stuff sil some of them noise 
like sil my brother in law is gay vocnoise and sil when i met him 
i knew he was i sil yknow sil he was the type sil some of 
them you cant tell well it doesnt matter what they look like vocnoise um sil 
but my husband said all through growing up sil he liked men sil he didnt 
like girls vocnoise he looked at laughmagazines you know all this stuff vocnoise and i 
thought thats so funny because growing up i just didnt know sil know anybody that 
was vocnoise sil um but sil you know he was openly gay to his mother 
right from the beginning vocnoise and vocnoise she was from germany which made it a 
little tough because sil yknow they didnt talk about sil unknown those things sil over 
there at all noise for a long time sil but um sil then she became 
very open with him and every but everybody knew noise sil and that was in 
the eighties noise and sil yknow sil if some kids know it when theyre young 
and growing up sil yknow i dont know if its best to not say it 
or to sil yknow vocnoise be open but if theyre open to their parents about 
it vocnoise then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better then 
sil than if they wait sil later on in their life sil yknow vocnoise but 
some of sometimes i guess they change sil yknow vocnoise most the men i knew 
sil right off the bat sil know i mean i mean it was it vocnoise 
and it was all through their life it wasnt as though they just said oh 
sil im cutoffgogoing sil im going be gay iver so sil i just sil with 
that terrible thing that happened extin sil montana iver with that boy iver and just 
just shows the ignorance in so many people vocnoise sil its at that really still 
bothers me that sil theres there is unknown still so much of that going on 
sil you know iver it was iver it is iver umhum iver umhum sil it 
does iver yeah they have the gay pride parade and everything which is good they 
should be able to iver yes iver well iver yes sil but you know what 
his parents are gonna sil yknow really going to let people know that iver this 
just cant go on not that theyre going to stop it totally iver but it 
made sil a lot of people more aware iver that its still really going on 
sil yknow and his parents accepted him iver which sil they have to iver you 
cant sil you cant be sil mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle sil you 
just cant lifes too short sil you know sil i mean vocnoise you can love 
them either way it doesnt make any difference iver noise they did iver i think 
so iver umhum iver right iver right iver that is iver noise iver no i 
dont either because i believe in the death penalty and i feel sil taking a 
life like that leaving someone there just to die iver tied up to a fence 
vocnoise sil you know sil i think they deserve to die sil because sil with 
the sil prisons and the overcrowding thats a whole another subject vocnoise you know that 
sil its just amazing to me so many people are in there that sil should 
be dead sil i feel sil because sil were just paying for them to vocnoise 
live in there iver but um iver yeah noise sil you want my name now 
iver okay excludename iver uh hum iver and youre not being recorded now iver oh 
you are vocnoise i dont see a microphone in front of you thats what i 
was wondering iver okay sil okay iver all right iver iver iver alright sil noise 
sil very good vocnoise sil were up here in the attic and vocnoise the inks 
freezing up on us iver who is gonna witness this now theres no one here 
iver oh vocnoise hum iver whereabouts upstate iver iver iver iver iver watertown waterbury iver 
watertown iver well after graduating from the state vocnoise uh vocnoise ive been here sil 
thirty some years vocnoise sil and employed now with the vocnoise transportation department vocnoise sil 
i started out in the finance area vocnoise with the vocnoise as an excludename sil 
and then when divesture of the bell system occurred in the country vocnoise uh i 
was drafted to vocnoise head up and develop a uh telecommunications section within o dot 
vocnoise and so currently uh vocnoise uh sil im vocnoise i used to be the 
manager of telecommunications of o dot but now im a laugh the special project coordinator 
sil for telecommunications at o dot sil and in addition im a vocnoise a cruise 
agent sil in preparation for retirement sil so ive been working on that noise and 
i got my cutoffassoassociates um sil accredited affiliation with the noise cruise line international here 
this last year vocnoise and so im ready to go cruising iver okay sil i 
have two cutoffkkids vocnoise two um students sil my one shes twenty six two sil 
two vocnoise sil children vocnoise ones a student here currently iver and uh the other 
one is um vocnoise a uh working cuff at the vocnoise cutoffssteubenville steubenville ohio vocnoise 
uh iver vocnoise cuff is uh vocnoise catholics united for the faith vocnoise its um 
sil she had to go up and graduate from miami university of ohio and got 
affiliated with uh sil campus crusade for christ and so forth and went out to 
dekalb in sil working for northern illinois vocnoise then went back working for the inner 
city area of chicago vocnoise and found herself vocnoise that she liked steubenville better vocnoise 
and when i relocated her sil people would say youre crazy young lady youre twenty 
five and youre moving to steubenville vocnoise theyre migrating out of here iver but uh 
vocnoise she likes the spirituality of the community over there vocnoise and iver i think 
this past year they had two vocnoise murders over there sil and it was publicized 
in the columbus area but uh sil it should vocnoise iver this iver yes iver 
and they had the strong uh public uh support over there its a really is 
sil tight knit community its uh quite different vocnoise columbus needs to learn a lot 
from that area vocnoise and uh vocnoise its a matter of just uh putting in 
i guess your hands in the sil your cutoffffaith sil practicing your faith sil which 
we iver well i cutoffthihthink i vocnoise i think we cutofftrutruly we sil oh yeah 
were were church goers but just be going church goers isnt uh isnt being faithful 
sil i think its just a vocnoise sharing yourself uh sil with one another in 
daily lives sil uh listening to someone outreaching to someone sil whatever it might be 
sil thats the the ministry that uh i think our our our lord has given 
us iver the opportunity to serve one another vocnoise and uh sil thats the downfall 
of our society because were thinking more of ourself vocnoise others sil and i think 
as cutoffyyou sil as we become vocnoise older sil you start thinking about sil how 
sil um much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you 
pull from your faith sil its not the materialistic things that the university here cutoffprogrprogresses 
sil uh sil professes to be the thing iver cuff iver yes iver i am 
and vocnoise they are the sil my wife wasnt iver umhum iver hes in his 
sophomore year iver i have no idea vocnoise yknow iver no it its in uh 
its in the ag vocnoise college but uh sil why its there i dont know 
sil its a matter sil of how sil they fit it in there but sil 
its dealing with construction management iver laugh iver north iver oh projects were vocnoise sil 
right from infancy were vocnoise i was designing vocnoise the project vocnoise first of all 
we had to find out what we had vocnoise with the vesture and vocnoise sil 
uh as everyone should know even as a residential user you have to know what 
you have in your house sil the telephone company doesnt sil provide the service to 
you anymore sil well we had to know what we had through out the state 
of ohio sil and some sil eighty eight counties and uh wherever else number of 
facilities we had sil and so we went on a scavenger hunt iver basically sil 
because the plans which the utilities had sil for our locations they could not provide 
to us because of the uh sil the vesture ruling sil so we had to 
go out and um vocnoise do our own surveys sil become self educated through uh 
courses uh through a t t and through purdue university it was i think o 
u had some courses vocnoise and um sil ultimately the university here now has i 
think a major in telecommunication group vocnoise but uh vocnoise the projects basically we were 
going from a um vocnoise putting together a network itself sil and uh we had 
a sil you think of a party line system what they used call daisy chain 
sil in the industry sil uh you had to wait and wait for your turn 
to get on to sil a data network sil and vocnoise we got down to 
point where sil we went to a vocnoise spoke network where everyone had dedicated pipe 
iver to the hub vocnoise um which course eliminated down time sil but with um 
vocnoise that we were sil not in a position to monitor traffic iver and telecommunications 
is very much like a highway sil you need to know what your loads going 
to be before you construct it or vice yknow vocnoise otherwise your plannings way off 
vocnoise well vocnoise nowadays were in a position where were doing vocnoise more advancement than 
anything our agency is the only one in the state of ohio sil and the 
private network vocnoise uh as a private sector is still looking as cutofflolooking looking at 
us vocnoise as a showcase sil were doing voice sil over i p internet vocnoise 
internet protocol sil which means were doing voice and data over the same pipe sil 
and the long line carriers sil they dont even know how to bill us iver 
and i think theres an article this last wednesday in the dispatch in business section 
as to sil how sil the p u c o cant regulate it and because 
of it they want to deregulate telecommunications sil uh and so for the past sil 
months we havent been getting telephone bills sil for usage sil we have the backbone 
were paying for sil and whats going to happen out of this whole thing is 
sil vocnoise it offers us a a vocnoise a a lot of latitude where vocnoise 
with uh sil we can cutoffnahnow now vocnoise um sil vocnoise if we have a 
contractor lets say over in dayton vocnoise and were calling from zanesville sil office vocnoise 
id rather make them long distance we can go on our pipe vocnoise and if 
we have a line going over dayton vocnoise we can make that call as if 
its a local call sil avoiding all long distance iver okay vocnoise so our backbone 
still there but vocnoise ultimately vocnoise as we get traffic uh measurements vocnoise we will 
be able to downsize the number of pipes we have sil so streamlining our network 
iver and uh vocnoise i said our our engineers theyre not engineers sil per se 
vocnoise but they are techies that are really in to this they they enjoy their 
work and vocnoise its for sil its in the forefront sil of ohio government vocnoise 
along with the technology vocnoise there has to also be the paperwork vocnoise now i 
know realize we have vocnoise a paperless environment vocnoise quote unquote iver but we still 
need to have property manager records thats very essential and a lot times when youre 
talking to engineers they dont vocnoise realize that part of it vocnoise um they dont 
like the detail sil at least sil that aspect of it vocnoise uh but we 
need to have a lot of that because you need know how vocnoise uh your 
uh vocnoise facilities are structured vocnoise uh the time history vocnoise any type of uh 
vocnoise activity on that whether its been uh installed vocnoise removed vocnoise relocated vocnoise whatever 
might be sil but we need know that how it had an impact upon the 
design of a the particular vocnoise uh facility voice and data vocnoise so thats basically 
what vocnoise weve been doing weve been progressing for fifteen years vocnoise and um vocnoise 
im proud to say that our state agency is probably the only agency other than 
maybe this vocnoise highway patrol sil we work a lot with them vocnoise but i 
think our were the only ones that have their own wiring cable people iver and 
sil the administrators for telecommunications for the state of ohio vocnoise are sil working with 
us as observers because they dont have a staff iver and um vocnoise it its 
great sil weve been reengineered last eight years o dot downsizing vocnoise and trying to 
fit the uh vocnoise uh fit the i guess the attributes the person brings to 
work sil as opposed to vocnoise not vocnoise one of the problems i cutoffffeel i 
see as an vocnoise as an employer or cutoffl as a supervisor vocnoise manager sil 
vocnoise a lot of times we have to promote because sil well vocnoise the bureaucracy 
says you have to sil do this in order to get up there vocnoise they 
dont take in consideration the attributes the person exthas and so now were saying okay 
if you bring this attribute to the table vocnoise and you can help the team 
extout vocnoise then why not reward extyou sil instead of putting you over here in 
lets say a extmanagerial position vocnoise which you really dont have any vocnoise vocnoisecall for 
but youre there because the money only vocnoise okay vocnoise so were trying to fit 
the attribute to the person compensate them accordingly vocnoise which vocnoise sil hey if vocnoise 
i think we did that wed probably have more teachers iver um vocnoise but the 
errorthrtrouble trouble is we dont fit the vocnoise horse with the proper carriage load vocnoise 
and we need to do that in our society we need to work as a 
extteam vocnoise theres no sense in having cutoffthrthree vocnoise having five guards on a basketball 
team vocnoise if you dont have a center that can tip it off and rebound 
iver but vocnoise we go out and look uh we look do it differently in 
sports but we do this differently in the unknown the uh secular world unknown iver 
we should look at it as vocnoise as a sport iver oh and that thats 
a problem in our society and if cutoffssomething if something can come out sil of 
the university here vocnoise to extpromote sil the reverse of that vocnoise i think you 
have sil a lot less psychological sil problems with people vocnoise and domestic problems sil 
work problems sil everything vocnoise because the sil problem comes down to the fact vocnoise 
well gee its not sil its not recognized yknow were vocnoise extwhatever extthese hesum vocnoise 
trends in our society that say well you gotta be a vocnoise you gotta be 
a vocnoise computer guru vocnoise you gotta be cutoffthithis vocnoise well before sil before vocnoise 
gates was recognized vocnoise he was nothing iver to our society vocnoise now we he 
we bow to him iver but what tell what does it tell us about our 
people sil were so extnaive sil vocnoise weve got to look inside ourselves and say 
what can we bring to society that that that can be more beneficial vocnoise and 
most the time vocnoise its sil listening iver not for long iver you consider the 
housing trends vocnoise and there vocnoise there again that goes back to the stupid consumer 
vocnoise i say stupid consumer because vocnoise when i was in college i always said 
well cutoffffourth consumer had a fourth grade education level iver and how vocnoise how many 
dollars does a consumer put in to research as opposed to the business vocnoise thats 
the inequity in our life vocnoise hesand youre youre basically putting the shaft to the 
consumer vocnoise iver and vocnoise until that consumer becomes on equal knowledge level as the 
vocnoise cutoffmarkmarket vocnoise hesuh its always gonna be inequitable and youre gonna have a vocnoise 
problem vocnoise in our society because vocnoise we dont need these large houses and so 
forth because as you progress in age vocnoise it becomes a liability vocnoise but then 
the developers are thinking well lets see well we can make vocnoisecondos downsize a little 
bit but still we want make this sil we want make this margin of extprofit 
vocnoise yeah we do but what about for societys sil best interests iver vocnoise well 
you used a word vocnoise earlier in your statement vocnoise what we extshould sil extbuy 
iver heswhat we should buy vocnoise yeah the retailer vocnoise what we should buy vocnoise 
and thats the vocnoise extproblem vocnoise we listen to vocnoise business sil too extmuch vocnoise 
if business vocnoise reemphasized vocnoise vocnoise their goals to help society out and not themselves 
iver vocnoise but you can extalso sil you also grow with extrespect vocnoise you can 
work with the community and still gain the respect from community and youll have allegiance 
but yknow nowadays we dont have any cutofflloyalty cutoffloyloyalty loyalty at all its out the 
window vocnoise uh and thats what i fear vocnoise the most vocnoise youre saying the 
internet sil vocnoise yeah sil big deal youre going after unknown what you want well 
maybe some people want low cost vocnoise they dont want service okay vocnoise boom vocnoise 
disposable vocnoise vocnoisethats the problem we have in our society today because of one thing 
vocnoise were trying cutoffcommunicommunicate vocnoise communicate as you say through the internet and through businesses 
vocnoise but we dont have vocnoise vocnoisecompassion sil and we dont have commitment vocnoise without 
those extthree sil youll never have success iver vocnoise well i think it starts vocnoise 
with the family vocnoise but the problem is in the last thirty years weve emphasized 
vocnoise uh not i shouldnt say thirty years sil post sil world war two vocnoise 
post world war two is where we broke the family up vocnoise and let me 
tell you how i vocnoise i analyze this vocnoise during world war two we took 
the little lady out of the house and said hey vocnoise we need you on 
the production lines vocnoise making war machineries iver so be it vocnoise yknow we had 
the unknown out there helping out the the g is fine vocnoise team effort wasnt 
it vocnoise but then vocnoise after g is came home vocnoise vocnoise the little lady 
went back in to the house vocnoise and business all these vocnoise idle lines say 
hey vocnoise we can do something here vocnoise because in those days the little lady 
said well ill go out and get a little odd job uh we want a 
little vocnoise thing vocnoise mom would do vocnoise pick up a little extra things here 
vocnoise and so forth vocnoise dad was a cutoffprprimary vocnoise primary breadwinner vocnoise but shed 
go out and do some odd jobs just to compliment vocnoise their needs for that 
budget vocnoise they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it vocnoise they 
did not vocnoise go out and spend on credit vocnoise and now i mean im 
jumping ahead of myself here but vocnoise business said hey lets produce these lines vocnoise 
little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can 
make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it iver extah extyeah extfine 
vocnoise now it comes back to your statement vocnoise what do they vocnoisetell us we 
need vocnoise sil well now well gee cutoffuw you need a refrigerator you need frost 
free vocnoise you need all these things vocnoise and you know extwhat vocnoise you go 
down the street and see how many garage sales you have sil and then you 
ask people sil whyd you buy them sil extoh we thought we needed them iver 
see it vocnoisethere again vocnoise the business out foxed the consumer vocnoise basically vocnoise you 
need to do vocnoise less consumption and buying material goods vocnoise and sharing your time 
with one another trying to understand your neighbor extmore vocnoise and spending time giving quality 
time for understanding the intangibles sil of life vocnoise vocnoisethe tangibles depreciate vocnoise and they 
will depreciate and will be nothing vocnoise and your investments vocnoise gone iver vocnoise but 
you vocnoisehad to you vocnoise you had to work sil you had to vocnoise you 
had to migrate vocnoise they they started separating the family up sil by saying vocnoise 
sir if you want a job were expanding to los angeles were cutoffsah vocnoise so 
they split the family up iver vocnoise okay fine vocnoise and the family sil probably 
said okay were we want you to get sil advancement we want vocnoise your good 
will vocnoise the problem is vocnoise you ran up a culture differences vocnoise culture differences 
over here and so forth unknown vocnoise and then we became a little more vocnoise 
uh promiscuous vocnoise and i said well gee yknow vocnoise mom dad and so forth 
they dont know whats going on out here on the west coast with us yknow 
and so forth vocnoise vocnoiseand they think everything is going okay because we didnt have 
communication as extfrequent vocnoise and then all of a sudden you find out vocnoise and 
usually mom found out she is something doesnt sound right through the airways or to 
the writing somethings mysterious going on here vocnoise and you find out they were cutoffdoindoing 
having difficulties vocnoise well divorce became acceptable sil before it was a no extno sil 
now its acceptable vocnoise and then vocnoise you had vocnoise uh the celebrities becoming more 
notable extah exthey we dont we dont cutoffgihget we dont get married anymore no okay 
vocnoise then we had the idea vocnoise of doing away with extcash sil gold metallic 
the metallic backing i think it was vocnoisekennedy was the one that did that vocnoise 
and said well just uh vocnoise print promissory notes vocnoise and so cutoffnnow sil now 
we keep extcredit sil we vocnoise we buy ourselves out every dilemma in the extworld 
vocnoise hesand saying well hey well just pay you extmore sil we pay you more 
country then fine sil but every time they sil print more sil it makes the 
money in your cutoffpurpurse investment extless sil but hey who cares huh thats what they 
vocnoise kept promoting sil and then all of a sudden about nineties they came around 
say hey you know what vocnoise our cutoffcrecredit our deficit is going the other way 
vocnoise were vocnoise were going way out of whack on this thing vocnoise thats because 
youve been spending more vocnoise consumers are doing the same thing vocnoise they havent learned 
that mom and dad remember vocnoise mom went out and got a little piece as 
a time that they needed things vocnoise no i want the whole house completely furnished 
i want the cars vocnoise we dont talk about buying cars nowadays we talk about 
leasing cars vocnoise and pretty soon were not going be buying houses well be leasing 
houses from the finance companies vocnoise we wont be owning a land the finance company 
own unknownthe kept promoting vocnoise and then all of sudden about nineties they came around 
and said vocnoisehey yknow what vocnoise our cutoffkr our deficit is going the other extway 
sil were vocnoise were going way out of whack on this thing vocnoise thats because 
weve been spending more vocnoise vocnoiseconsumers are doing the same thing vocnoise they havent extlearned 
that mom and dad remember vocnoise mom when out and got a little piece as 
the time as they needed things vocnoise no i want the whole house completely furnished 
i want the cars vocnoise we dont talk about buying vocnoisecars nowadays we talk about 
leasing cars vocnoise and pretty soon were not gonna be buying houses well be leasing 
houses from the finance companies vocnoise we wont be owning the land the finance company 
own the vocnoise you dont own it sil youre leasing it vocnoise and thats our 
quality of extlife vocnoise and when we go to third world countries we say vocnoise 
i dont know how they can stand living here vocnoise and extyet vocnoise yknow what 
vocnoise they probably have better quality of understanding one another vocnoise then we do vocnoise 
because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further you 
become apart iver vocnoise you said were their governments cutoffresponsresponsible vocnoise government stays out of 
extthings sil thats our problem vocnoise governments vocnoise into too many things vocnoise they need 
to be vocnoise out of your nose sil cutoffwiwith vocnoise thats your personal business they 
need to be out of your business vocnoise cutoffaand iver the personal thing is you 
need to have vocnoise ethics iver in the business world vocnoise in other words vocnoise 
i used to work vocnoise uh during hesuh highschool days vocnoise for a furniture company 
hesand back in those days it was nine days sil vocnoisecash vocnoise hesand wed sell 
it to people and the vocnoise and i said well gee vocnoise we just vocnoise 
and we talked to the manager vocnoise oh they they dont have the cutoffmonmoney they 
dont have the money thats financed the extbank vocnoise well why are we selling it 
to them then vocnoise well well get our money back and the bank bank get 
the money and well get a cutofff well repossess it vocnoise and we sold the 
same darn thing over three or four exttimes sil this poor sucker is out there 
get stuck with credit ratings vocnoise the banks making money vocnoise were making money vocnoise 
theyre losing vocnoise now is that business ethics vocnoise i ask you vocnoise is it 
no unknown is it proper business cutoffethethics ethics iver thats where we need to correct 
iver thats where you need to correct vocnoise you cant just say vocnoise hey we 
got a schnook out here we can screw him vocnoise thats a vocnoise problem vocnoise 
and youre saying does it cutofftih does it does it take home does it take 
church vocnoise it vocnoise takes morals vocnoise and thats why i was telling before we 
got away from morals in our society vocnoise we could care less about you vocnoise 
i always say a cutoffssalesman a uh good successful salesman will be able to sell 
his own mother vocnoise i mean sell his own mother vocnoise on a cutoffnon on 
the market iver vocnoise youre not gonna make as much vocnoisemoney the people are gonna 
say gee im not going to them unknown im unknown place else vocnoise again it 
gets back to weaknesses in our standards in society vocnoise we we could care less 
about anybody else vocnoise we dont vocnoise hey if i have problems vocnoise the government 
is gonna help me out vocnoise thats a mindset thats been entrenched for forty some 
extyears vocnoise vocnoiseits a mindset vocnoise that if you talk to the older generations are 
dying off now vocnoise that said we would never had in our lifetime vocnoise its 
a ruination of our vocnoise country vocnoise and if you are old enough to remember 
kruschev vocnoise i believe krushchev is right we will bury you vocnoise well bury you 
internally in other words we will break you up you will separate internally you have 
dysfunctional people we are vocnoise were dysfunctional families vocnoise if you ever work on pastoral 
care activity youll find out that people vocnoise are so concerned about their families vocnoise 
that they cutoffffail vocnoise they fail vocnoise they think because their family is broken up 
theyve got vocnoise single parents here theyve got vocnoise divorced here vocnoise uh vocnoise they 
dont know whats going on theyre doing drugs vocnoise well the vocnoise problem is we 
never got involved vocnoise as you said busy vocnoise we make more time yknow theres 
more time vocnoise spent for soccer on sunday vocnoise then going to church vocnoise you 
talk about vocnoise uh they said was it meet the press cutoffquoquote as i think 
slogan is vocnoise a vocnoiseday without meet vocnoise a sunday without meet the press vocnoise 
yknow day unknown was it vocnoise something like hesuh sundays not a sunday without meet 
the extpress sil well hey vocnoise that just tells you right there vocnoise where our 
thoughts extare sil were extonly vocnoisethinking of ourselves vocnoise i guarantee it as you get 
older vocnoise you start thinking a little differently vocnoise and i think as you talk 
you should be talking to some older people vocnoise im saying people um in the 
in their eighties vocnoise to find out how the progression of life is vocnoise and 
how you think vocnoise because when you go to estate sales vocnoise all youre talking 
about this profit motive vocnoise youre sitting on a lawns vocnoise the quality of life 
vocnoise is in the mind the person youre vocnoise you you avoided all the time 
iver and thats what were concerned with vocnoise you need to interact more with people 
we need to interact more people sil every day of our life thats what we 
vocnoise learn vocnoise from vocnoise we dont learn by giving vocnoise things to people vocnoise 
just like if you were um sil hesuh vocnoise a parent giving a giving allowance 
you dont give them to vocnoise your kids uh money to do chores and that 
you dont expect them to do vocnoise but you give them something in addition vocnoise 
to develop more responsibility vocnoise but we dont talk about responsibility in our society today 
vocnoise i i vocnoise i dare you to say were in a cutoffhehk vocnoise they 
say publicly vocnoise this is vocnoise our bill of responsibility vocnoise do you know where 
there is sil noise do we talk about responsibilities now iver if you if vocnoise 
if if you say buy vocnoise buy from those vocnoise unscrupulous business people and say 
vocnoise ah gee these guys got it on credit vocnoise yeah vocnoise what happens to 
that person vocnoise that files bankruptcy vocnoise ah vocnoise file bankruptcy its okay vocnoise ill 
do something else vocnoise next time iver we start them over again vocnoise they have 
never learned vocnoise and reason why vocnoise youre throwing out vocnoisecarrying out too vocnoise much 
in front of them without saying hey vocnoise you gotta do this to prove this 
to me vocnoise extno we we we vocnoise lack hesuh vocnoise one heck a lot 
of vocnoise vocnoiseethical moral standards in this country were losing it every day vocnoise and 
until we start looking at ourselves in in the mirror at night and say vocnoise 
im proud of myself im proud of what i did vocnoise i may not have 
made a dollar exttoday vocnoise but i understood somebody exttoday iver no iver vocnoise oh 
hesi iver exti i vocnoise i dont think its necessarily that i think its comes 
back to the lack of self discipline iver no i vocnoise you had women that 
working before vocnoise you had vocnoise women working before vocnoise but self discipline is unknown 
family vocnoise its part of it sil self discipline vocnoise making things too easy for 
us oh we vocnoisecant do without it vocnoise you ever vocnoise you ever try to 
work for something i mean you really struggle to to achieve something sil did it 
mean more to you than something that was given to you vocnoise tell me iver 
but but was if that if that but if that p h d was given 
to you vocnoise if they lowered the standards vocnoise if they lowered the standards vocnoise 
for you to get into vocnoise graduate extschool vocnoise it wouldnt that be challenging for 
you hey great they lowered it for me vocnoise my sister didnt have oh she 
had a rough time getting in but now i can get in anywhere i got 
a lower cutoffstastandard vocnoise iver cutoffdoedoesnt that iver doesnt that mean make iver so when 
you compare iver vocnoise iver right vocnoise they vocnoise and thats it they hadnt had 
a challenge you need to have challenges put sil to you everyday vocnoise everyday vocnoise 
unknown you have more meaningfulness in life vocnoise so that when you vocnoise put your 
head down at night youre saying oh im thankful for what i did vocnoise laugh 
gosh darn it im still coming to you vocnoise i hesneed more help tomorrow because 
laugh without vocnoise something vocnoiseintangible vocnoise theres gonna be a motivation factor vocnoise someones gotta 
give you a drill and to get up tomorrow morning and say hey im gonna 
do a better job today vocnoise than i did yesterday vocnoise but when we vocnoise 
as a society vocnoise say oh vocnoise gee vocnoise hes struggled yesterday well vocnoise lets 
lower this thing bar lets vocnoise lower the bar a little more vocnoise lets lower 
vocnoise yknow vocnoise gosh darn it vocnoise hey vocnoise scooney you didnt make that last 
shot last night vocnoise hey vocnoise hey time out vocnoise lets give scooney two more 
minutes to make vocnoise lets let him have another shoot vocnoise he gets two more 
minutes to try to get it iver and well just watch vocnoise okay vocnoise come 
on scooney vocnoise he made it okay he made it in vocnoise three minutes vocnoise 
thirty seconds left he made it vocnoise we win now vocnoise does that make the 
game interesting to you iver vocnoise if cutoffwwe if we really score sports vocnoise i 
mean vocnoise the game of sports not the cutoffadministraadministration the administration of sports is just 
as unethical as the business world sil it is sil unethical vocnoise and its one 
of the biggest problems we have in our society vocnoise because weve emphasized vocnoise sports 
vocnoise along with the theater vocnoise as being sil oh the vocnoise way to extgo 
vocnoise and that the poor vocnoise the poorest benchmarks you could have vocnoise in terms 
of financial vocnoise hesuh vocnoise appreciation vocnoise sure you unknown thing is you vocnoise market 
demands the uh dollar that type of thing well yeah vocnoise let them do it 
vocnoise but the thing is vocnoise it gets almost be unknown like a lawsuit case 
vocnoise we are vocnoise crazy and insane people vocnoise again gets back to vocnoise ethics 
vocnoise do you think vocnoise do you think im worth vocnoise thirty million extdollars vocnoise 
let me ask you let vocnoise let me ask you question vocnoise why in the 
hell are you coming and asking for thirty million extdollars sil dont you think youre 
vocnoise extuncouth iver and yet vocnoise we sit down and negotiate for it vocnoise and 
then on top of it vocnoise those people that participate in the vocnoise um vocnoise 
sponsors vocnoise are vocnoise just as bad iver vocnoise well i think it was then 
vocnoise a nice thing about we vocnoisehad vocnoise hesuh we had uh sil grandparents that 
were not necessarily they were out of state sil in some cases vocnoise we didnt 
see them that much vocnoise we made a part that vocnoise uh we communicated with 
the grandparents regularly sil and when we did cutoffiit it was a special exttime vocnoise 
extwe hesum vocnoise emphasized the fact that hesum sil hesuh sil yknow kids wanna do 
certain things okay they saw their mother vocnoise go out and maybe extdo some additional 
things to work for that vocnoise uh the aspect vocnoise we uh asked them if 
they wanted to go on um vocnoise a project with the class so forth fine 
vocnoise but you gotta participate in it too we well match you with what you 
come up with vocnoise we made them part of the extowner sil we gave them 
responsibilities vocnoise they grew up with the aspect vocnoise they learned by being around vocnoise 
some older people vocnoise uh vocnoise which uh i think was good iver because uh 
again i said you vocnoise bring up you get wisdom from that as long as 
youre listening to them vocnoise hesuh extsome people sil i dont care what their age 
was they just blew them extoff vocnoise hesuh sil and so that plus you have 
they vocnoise i think a understanding of um vocnoise the schooling vocnoise they came from 
vocnoise um iver they went they went to private schools they went to private schools 
vocnoise i certainly did not want them to go to public schools vocnoise and even 
when going to ohio state vocnoise um vocnoise compared to miami university i saw a 
difference i see a differences in the standards of the of the students vocnoise uh 
vocnoise but vocnoise i believe and ive seen it with my son going to ohio 
state that his vocnoise morals vocnoise that hes gained through his uh vocnoise precollege years 
vocnoise are staying with him vocnoise uh and im very grateful that theres uh spiritual 
guidance i keep telling these guys vocnoise guys unknown my daughter and son vocnoise excuse 
me vocnoise that um sil yknow theyd come to me for vocnoise answers vocnoise now 
i think vocnoise now i extknow thats something thats probably the other problem is sometimes 
maybe the cutoffs vocnoise the the hesum siblings extor the children do not have a 
parent to go to vocnoise but vocnoise again let me erroraratereiterate cutoffreireiterate reiterate vocnoise we 
dont have a smooth marriage vocnoise they saw us have difficult times vocnoise and they 
saw us sil saw us our spouses crying together vocnoise forgiving one another vocnoise arguing 
with another vocnoise just as much as you can have a being human relationship they 
saw that vocnoise they saw the love for one another vocnoise they saw vocnoise over 
night where id start take caring for my dad vocnoise because my mother died instantly 
yknow like short term an hour vocnoise and now he has a stroke noise i 
didnt know whether vocnoise i stay out of their extlives vocnoise and i had to 
learn all that vocnoise hesand vocnoise i had vocnoisetakecare of vocnoisehim but then they saw 
my extwife sil vocnoisetaking over some my role at exthome vocnoise so we swing them 
thats why i said a team extplayer vocnoise we knew what we had do vocnoise 
uh my son might come home i said well gee yknow he he he might 
smart off my wife will say hey sil thats your dad give him respect iver 
oh vocnoise okay vocnoise okay its part of growing up unknown and i ive been 
there done that too but still vocnoise you have to vocnoise you have to um 
vocnoise know theres respect out there to be warranted vocnoise and you expect it vocnoise 
and not just sil demand it vocnoise you got to vocnoise you have to work 
to show vocnoise respect and then you should get respect for it vocnoise but then 
vocnoise they saw the interaction with the elderly people vocnoise the school he went to 
vocnoise a lot of public involvement public service required vocnoise the teachers vocnoise i often 
ask the teachers ive gone to sporting events vocnoise and their teachers are there sil 
ticket exttakers vocnoise uh monitoring the crowd wherever the kids vocnoise i ask them i 
said do you guys ever go home vocnoise said extno vocnoise oh yeah i said 
vocnoise but theyre always there vocnoise theyre not there just teaching a class vocnoise theyre 
not there vocnoise preparing the class sil theyre there vocnoise after the class theyre there 
for the student vocnoise and they make the student feel part of the family vocnoise 
that is a continuation of my philosophy at home vocnoise we interact vocnoise the school 
vocnoise is great vocnoise you have people that are on the clock oh vocnoise time 
to quit vocnoise theyre gone vocnoise those people dont know meaning of life noise they 
will never know the meaning of life vocnoise but if they stay around vocnoise try 
to extend themselves little more with somebody thats having problems at work vocnoise and are 
willing to work with that person vocnoise i didnt say vocnoise willing to work vocnoise 
not knowing sil theyre going to be compensated vocnoise because theyll be compensated sil not 
necessarily materialistically theyll be cutoffmantaw vocnoise extthen vocnoise more than theyre expected theyll be vocnoise 
recompensated somewhere vocnoise but the thing is to vocnoise lend an open hand vocnoise not 
knowing vocnoise well gee whats for vocnoise whats in it for me vocnoise whats in 
it for you is uh intangible vocnoise are you willing iver then iver then you 
have a choice there vocnoise you would not necessarily sil uh have sil you shouldve 
had more self control vocnoise and not had the child vocnoise dont expect me to 
pay for your vocnoise uh lack of uh will power vocnoise thats vocnoise that is 
sil a selfish attitude sil thats stealing sil as well iver umhum sil noise iver 
umhum vocnoise im sure somewhere vocnoise im sure somewhere along the line that they would 
work things out to try to help her over those vocnoise bumps vocnoise it wouldnt 
be long term vocnoise and they would know that it would not be long term 
vocnoise but thats the intangible im saying you have somebody there because vocnoise shes giving 
up her time and not to make the high bucks vocnoise but cutoffshshe what shes 
bringing about is developing a character in a person vocnoise to bring about the spirituality 
in a person thats gonna carry them all through life vocnoise shes extalso vocnoise hesum 
vocnoise tithing sil more than vocnoisetithing probably vocnoise uh which uh i always uh kid 
with people i said the author unknown said ten percent tithing vocnoise knew inflation he 
knew great about vocnoise economics ten percent is ten percent vocnoise and then vocnoise uh 
on top of that yknow vocnoise we talked about economics uh vocnoise little further here 
vocnoise uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and the cutoffchichinese and 
germans so forth vocnoise and uh vocnoise boy yknow vocnoise taking that page out of 
the old bible arent they vocnoise we dont sil laugh iver oh yeah iver yeah 
iver definitely so my daughter definitely its cause she was working for campus crusade for 
christ vocnoise and she came home one vocnoise weekend from uh oxford and um sil 
gave me these leading questions and i said uh huh vocnoise i know where youre 
coming from i been confronted with that vocnoise when i was at ohio state and 
so forth vocnoise and um vocnoise so i just layed it on the line to 
her iver in my own vocnoise civilian terms i said vocnoise why would you wanna 
give up on the original sil yknow why would you wanna give up on the 
original have a copy vocnoise because all these others vocnoise wannabes vocnoise well in other 
words you follow christianity iver the catholic church is the first sil christian church vocnoise 
and all the others vocnoise are fragments vocnoise they wannabe they still tie back to 
it but uh dont want extthat vocnoise its like the commitment i was telling you 
vocnoise well id like to but vocnoise could you make a little extra vocnoise give 
me two more minutes to make that field goal vocnoise oh yeah well give you 
those but vocnoise okay vocnoise then well start well start only up here vocnoise and 
we vocnoise and well organize all this stuff but then were gonna give two extra 
minutes in our rules noise okay vocnoise we gonna live this way and uh so 
forth vocnoise so we we vocnoise we develop things as they accommodate to our own 
selfish extbeings vocnoise not to the vocnoise sacrifice of what we should be doing vocnoise 
and were all mortal and were all gonna be vocnoise in that vocnoise and were 
im not saying no one makes those errors makes errors its always there vocnoise the 
problem is vocnoise to vocnoise try to stay focused vocnoise on that vocnoise not to 
jump ship vocnoise yknow they say in this country vocnoise oh you dont like leave 
it vocnoise iver why would you wanna leave you said youre a third world country 
vocnoise why would you wanna be to table to id been vocnoise i wouldnt unknown 
this this country has a lot of problems vocnoise its just like sil my family 
has a lot of problems why would i cutoffwaawanna cutoffliyleave unknown cutoffpraabproblems vocnoise leave the 
family why would i leave the country vocnoise why not vocnoise work with it and 
correct it cause when i run away from it vocnoise vocnoise yknow what im doing 
vocnoise im running into another chaos vocnoise at the other end vocnoise someone else coming 
the other direction vocnoise and they havent resolved things vocnoise and thats been happening our 
society vocnoise we havent vocnoise sit down vocnoise to learn vocnoise and understand one another 
f iver umhum iver vocnoise well vocnoise as i told my sil daughter when she 
came i said yknow sil religion is is vocnoise is a business she says oh 
no dad its not religion vocnoise i said it sure is a business vocnoise i 
said vocnoise its just vocnoise the superficial things vocnoise the packages vocnoise are attractive to 
you iver and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite sil article sil 
every now and then sil umhum vocnoise i said but when you get down to 
the meat sil of it vocnoise its the same thing vocnoise and i said vocnoise 
and thats where it comes down to vocnoise the catholic church for example vocnoise they 
can put all you can have folk masses you can do all this superficial stuff 
on the thing to make it more attractive vocnoise and they do every vocnoise every 
religion vocnoise makes it more attractive for her vocnoise oh as used to unknown come 
from oh yeah vocnoise but the bottom line is vocnoise sil youre trying to still 
vocnoise if youre a christian vocnoise focus back to the bible iver okay vocnoise how 
do you do how do you get back to the original without sil being part 
of the original iver well my question is vocnoise whos more important in our basketball 
team vocnoise the five starters or the sixth man coming off the bench vocnoise i 
ask you now who vocnoise ask george reese is he more unknown vocnoise is he 
less important this year than he was last year iver well that im making an 
analogy with you women vocnoise whos more important vocnoise who saying vocnoise that not vocnoise 
being vocnoise not being a priest vocnoise is not important vocnoise being your individual vocnoise 
were vocnoise all called to vocnoise be vocnoise important vocnoise a priest is just as 
vocnoise a occupation vocnoise a part of that society out there vocnoise he do vocnoise 
president of the united states isnt any better off than you are vocnoise he shouldnt 
be iver what vocnoise were animals iver were animals vocnoise everyones looking for leaders vocnoise 
its the rules of church simplest rule iver so if you want get to me 
two more minutes a play vocnoise okay now you got another leg vocnoise but the 
thing is vocnoise let me ask you question vocnoise how does that impact you if 
you cant be a priest noise arent there vocnoise other vocnoise important vocnoise quote unquote 
vocnoise roles for women vocnoise in the church vocnoise arent there other important roles iver 
arent there other important roles vocnoise what would those nuns be vocnoise where would your 
mother vocnoise possibly been if she went to catholic school vocnoise i take it vocnoise 
where would she have been sil if it werent for the nuns vocnoise why we 
put nuns down vocnoise hey vocnoise they worked vocnoise lot less than your mother vocnoise 
is even getting compensated for vocnoise and they had a very important role vocnoise for 
vocnoise your vocnoise development vocnoise even though youre generation is removed iver well that gets 
back to what youre saying almost th the family life vocnoise hey whats ahead vocnoise 
what you dont need a noise husband all you need is a sperm bank vocnoise 
thats what youre saying arent you vocnoise arent you iver yes you are youre saying 
you dont need to have a leader vocnoise in the family vocnoise you vocnoise and 
if im gonna be a leader im gonna be the one vocnoise im gonna be 
the one not the sperm bank oh you came from this little tube here oh 
okay thats the principle family no i hafta be because vocnoise theres no father here 
vocnoise well vocnoise iver iver again they set different roles iver the iver they set 
different roles up fine vocnoise give me two more minutes to play iver the problem 
is vocnoise lack of commitment vocnoise the lack of commitment vocnoise and not saying hey 
vocnoise theres a niche for you vocnoise you cant be a male sil oh yeah 
you wanna do the operation i cant be feeling yeah you wanna do vocnoise well 
vocnoise why not be happy what you are god made you what you are vocnoise 
why not make vocnoise you the complete person you are vocnoise and not strive for 
something you cant vocnoise be iver thats the thing vocnoise but the thing is some 
people vocnoise some people say vocnoise some people say vocnoise well watch this the thing 
is vocnoise why dont you talk to those people and say hey vocnoise why not 
vocnoise do what im doing best vocnoise in other words compliment the team iver yes 
iver umhum iver right iver so we lower the standards to meet that iver product 
certain things sil but they vocnoise they want everything to be the same they cant 
be sil they cant be the same its just a natural thing vocnoise but the 
thing is vocnoise let them sil do what they can vocnoise thats a god given 
talent what you have there vocnoise okay nurse vocnoise and how many refuse the nurse 
voluntarily vocnoise when they have children vocnoise why vocnoise talking among you women folk vocnoise 
why vocnoise do you have well i dont want to unknown vocnoise you have the 
natural ability vocnoise to give all the vocnoise all the natural protein the immunization things 
all that maternal milk why cant you instead of getting off the shelf iver laugh 
iver its just a rule iver its a rule coming down hand down iver tradition 
iver theres a tradition vocnoise you see now youre looking youre looking for reasons vocnoise

how could you cut down a student and say no thats not the way it 
was sil and its nothing sil youre learning from a teachers guide vocnoise unknown vocnoise 
no but how do you know if i ask in the first vocnoise but its 
a matter of tradition of handing it down to the tradition vocnoise itself vocnoise its 
a matter of having in your family vocnoise what did your parents think of this 
way and that way vocnoise and its vocnoise its not unknown necessarily sil written down 
but its passed on those days probably written down or not written down but vocnoise 
verbal vocnoise and extended vocnoise and so its that sil hand down from generation those 
were the good old days vocnoise thats a good old day thats when you used 
to own them too vocnoise you could trade them unknown that vocnoise thats when we

were they were troubled kids in the past they came from troubled backgrounds they did 
iver well im saying but the iver oh i think uh iver i dont know

vocnoise knowing vocnoise your your children how theyre gonna react to certain things vocnoise oh 
what it is uh vocnoise i dont know details with thing other than the fact 
that theyre vocnoise seem like theres lot emptiness going on vocnoise uh with them vocnoise

vocnoise but thats what im saying vocnoise but but thats thats what im saying and 
the same things happening when we had a bussing vocnoise we took kids out of 
the poor environment vocnoise and put them in vocnoise nice environment vocnoise oh they vocnoise 
theyve got the taste of it then went back home vocnoise oh unknown vocnoise and 
we did and vocnoise very unjustice thing to those kids vocnoise and to the families 
vocnoise and then when we broke them up vocnoise we did something else yknow take 
them out vocnoise then we lost that community involvement so now the parents cant follow 
their kids to their activities vocnoise get them splitting it up hey vocnoise we dont 
want them we dont want a families vocnoise thats a vocnoise misnomer they said vocnoise

wife and i this time iver i cutofftrahtravel cutofftrahtravel vocnoise traveling has been unknown even 
for the transportation department i travel across the state vocnoise and country vocnoise and before 
that i was always traveling we took unknown two weeks off when we go back

iver unknown i enjoy traveling i enjoy meeting people when i go on these vocnoise 
these travel things i have to for business i meet sil with the uh vocnoise 
the the ships and so forth go back behind but then vocnoise when i go 
to the ports vocnoise uh vocnoise the companies pretty much know what they vocnoise contract 
with us unknown i like to meet with the people there unknown the gestapo and 
so forth ill talk with them and vocnoise and uh vocnoise learn more about vocnoise 
their little vocnoise uh things just like noise down in saint croix last year uh 
vocnoise spent two hours talking to the security there and he said vocnoise boy theres 
something wrong you guys from the continentals vocnoise i said continental vocnoise thats what we 
call you guys from the states iver oh boy vocnoise i said vocnoise and unknown 
this vocnoise and here vocnoise i here unknown i come from this is a gentlemen 
thats uh vocnoise dark skin vocnoise i dont know if hes black or colored sil 
im still confused as to what difference in black and colored is vocnoise but vocnoise 
uh vocnoise he says vocnoise yknow my brothers probably came vocnoise to these islands to 
the to the continental vocnoise they come down here vocnoise and theyre getting all unknown 
theyre swaying themselves theyre vocnoise acting cocky to me and so forth vocnoise and i 
say vocnoise we dont do that here vocnoise and i said well i know this 
yknow vocnoise uh vocnoise theres a lot of black population here vocnoise creole mix and 
that type of thing vocnoise which i would consider colored not black vocnoise uh to 
me black is black vocnoise if you have anything mixed in you its colored vocnoise 
uh vocnoise but vocnoise he said uh vocnoise we dont sil do that vocnoise uh 
vocnoise he said vocnoise problem in the states gosh you guys cutoffkaar vocnoise daddy wants 
vocnoise kid wants a car get him a car vocnoise down here vocnoise child only 
comes from the school vocnoise i uh i gave him a dinner vocnoise but i 
ask him to sweep off the front porch vocnoise now ill still give him his 
dinner but i ask him please did you do your vocnoise sweep the front porch 
vocnoise may not sound much but at least im trying to teach him something vocnoise 
and you vocnoise you saw all that down there vocnoise in the people where we 
were down vocnoise fredericksburg vocnoise but uh vocnoise it its its just those things you 
you learn and and theres other times i was down in jamaica and you went 
back into the back country and you saw vocnoise very impoverished uh area so i 
iver almost made a mission film where the families living with the animals in the 
same house vocnoise and vocnoise you try to understand and vocnoise and you youll never 
vocnoise theyll never get away from poverty and the classes in our society thats just 
vocnoise life theres always gonna be that but the thing is vocnoise try to have 
understanding compassion for them and try to reach out and vocnoise sometimes the people dont 
sil want it sil either sil and vocnoise sometimes you can see well now i 
know why they dont want it because they dont know they dont know how to 
handle it vocnoise they appreciate the thought vocnoise that goes a lot longer than just 
giving them that vocnoise because if they get it they dont know what do with 
it vocnoise so vocnoise i i really vocnoise i really think uh vocnoise um vocnoise 
as i was saying traveling vocnoise uh people are all the same worldwide vocnoise they 
just give them different colors different facial vocnoise different accents vocnoise cutoffdihdifferent so god can 
give them vocnoise unique characteristics so he can call them his own vocnoise and he 
knows each every one of us vocnoise but uh vocnoise were all the same its 
down to talking about the emotions and vocnoise the drive vocnoise and i keep asking 
her keep a vocnoise one thing to ask yourself vocnoise and ask the business person 
vocnoise what would you be doing vocnoise today if you were born in a third 
world country sil how thankful are you that youre here vocnoise and how do you 
show that thankfulness iver youre youre here for a reason vocnoise and youre here in 
the united states for a reason vocnoise of all the beatitudes you have here sil 
dont you think its time to share some of those things the talent vocnoise and 
to vocnoise not necessarily be recognized for those things but yknow some vocnoise some personalities 
require personalities thats the way it is but vocnoise uh vocnoise to do things without 
expecting something in return vocnoise that would be so nice to see that written on 
magazine fronts oh yeah yeah vocnoise were not vocnoise wow whats getting into these people 
theyre not thinking vocnoise yknow if we can teach people to think vocnoise the way 
youre trying to tell me well laugh vocnoise businesses tell us we should do this 
vocnoise then why doesnt business vocnoise take a more vocnoise social correctiveness vocnoise not political 
correctness vocnoise no vocnoise yeah the they will not increase until the tax law revises 
itself again to up vocnoise the vocnoise deduction allowances vocnoise because even when we reduce 
deductions it went down to vocnoise yeah iver sil no vocnoise yeah cutoffthethey they will 
not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the vocnoise unknown deduction 
allowances vocnoise because even when we reduced deductions it went down too sil yeah sil 
yeah vocnoise and then again vocnoise uh you say well vocnoise yknow like well maybe 
some affluent uh person would donate and its publicized iver donate so much dont know 
unknown vocnoise okay well that you remember vocnoise back sometime in may were ninety percent 
tax brackets and so forth vocnoise so that means ninety cents on that dollar he 
gave iver they didnt cutoffbrbring they didnt bring that up unknown sil he only gave 
ten cents iver vocnoise again it gets back to the ten percent tithing vocnoise and 
um vocnoise i think theres something else in the bible where you know she unknown 
the vocnoise lady gives gives sil only a small portion compared to a larger portion 
but vocnoise in relation to what her income was sil that meant a lot more 
vocnoise and that we need to get more involved in that vocnoise we need promote 
more of that vocnoise if were going package things materialize we need to think more 
of that vocnoise but i think really take hold of the night sil vocnoise vocnoise 
what would you be doing if youre a third world country didnt have choice iver 
hesyou you vocnoise why you be doing eight children vocnoise and iver trying to feed 
eight children vocnoise and it vocnoise if youre here in a cutoffccountry this country vocnoise 
any eight children vocnoise why you have eight children to start with iver shouldnt you 
have little more knowledge little more sil support around you sil educating sil knowing sil 
self discipline vocnoise and vocnoise on whats on really on top whats really in crazy 
is when you have vocnoise multiple fathers sil and the children dont know the dads 
iver vocnoise that comes back to the lack of our morals and the lack of 
cutoffselfunknown vocnoise and our society promotes it sil theyre doing a unknown to tax laws 
in our uh all the government vocnoise you see government do this governments doing it 
to themselves iver vocnoise well i vocnoise iver again gets back to being in the 
home vocnoise did your mother give you everything you wanted vocnoise then she failed you 
didnt she iver not really iver well according to the government she would have iver 
and you dont the problem is as a youngsters you grow up vocnoise you dont 
realize how much your parents did for you until youre vocnoise probably until youre about 
thirty extfive forty you dont realize my goodness mom and dad you made a sacrifice 
vocnoise because now im learning a little more what you did vocnoise and then by 
the time youre vocnoise uh maybe vocnoise sixty vocnoise sil fifty sixty now you got 
errorstaycare vocnoise take care of your parents vocnoise if you have the morals to do 
it otherwise just ship them off to the farm iver and theres people like that 
today still vocnoise you go vocnoise but i think people should go to vocnoise um 
vocnoise retirement centers vocnoise uh huh sil uh and uh sit down make a visit 
to them vocnoise every vocnoise week vocnoise make it part of life sil vocnoise and 
develop a friendship iver vocnoise youd learn a heck a lot from that uh vocnoise 
aging person vocnoise sil a heck a lot more than you would vocnoise through interviewing 
me vocnoise really iver no iver no vocnoise im living vocnoise yeah thats my errormydiunknown 
my um role call iver yeah iver yeah vocnoise and uh sil thats the generation 
im talking about those are generation cutoffththey they they went through the depression and so 
forth they vocnoise they were the unknown vocnoise i sil i i pity i feel 
sorry for your generation vocnoise which is my daughters generation and uh sil part of 
my sons vocnoise i because um vocnoise i errorgunknown sil i sil i dont see 
how in the heck the wages arent going up that much vocnoise prices are up 
consumerisms going up vocnoise sil somewhere along the extline vocnoise uh the consumer is going 
to have to start getting a little wiser vocnoise and say well iver what do 
i want out of life iver vocnoise the trouble is vocnoise if he does get 
wiser too much hes usually about forty years of age and he says gosh darn 
it i wish i listened iver vocnoise error iver noise iver vocnoise sil it vocnoise 
it would be interesting vocnoise to see vocnoise how much of your generation vocnoise sil 
is saving vocnoise cutoffhhow vocnoise first of all how much they earning vocnoise sil vocnoise 
how much they expect to pay for a house sil vocnoise sil and all these 
other things vocnoise know they they say to you why well ill save ten percent 
church vocnoise then you got vocnoise oh gee five dollars here cutoffthrthree or sil cutoffmaymaybe 
twenty cents a unknown twenty cents an hour exthere you this vocnoise you figure all 
those up sil all these campaigns you hear during course a year vocnoise i often 
thought it would be great for marketing vocnoise take all those figures sil and add 
up and see if it adds up to a hundred percent sil vocnoise and if 
it does vocnoise then where are your goals sil vocnoise see when i bought a 
house vocnoise the financier vocnoise sil came in i went to his office and he 
said vocnoise oh mister excludename no problem no problem vocnoise you can get that house 
sil i said sil i can vocnoise yeah vocnoise youre professional and youre wifes professional 
sil i said thats how youre evaluating it sil on both of us yes vocnoise 
i said then i dont want to do business with you sil why im going 
give you a loan i said vocnoise i dont want do business with you sil 
vocnoise because you didnt ask me about my goals sil vocnoise my goals was not 
to have my wife sil work sil vocnoise because nowadays vocnoise takes two of them 
to work vocnoise im cutoffderwondering wondering when theyre going to child labor law sil uh 
revoke that vocnoise because vocnoise with two of them working vocnoise im wondering how many 
more hours a day vocnoise you can squeeze out of a couples personal life vocnoise 
so theyll have sanity vocnoise at some time in their life to enjoy life vocnoise 
when these people start realizing vocnoise hey cutoffwwere vocnoise its cutoffiit sil were chasing our 
tails vocnoise then those two cutoffcoupcouple that that couple sil got wise and said hey 
vocnoise were going to do with less sil and were going go for quality sil 
vocnoise when that vocnoise when that couple reaches that mentality sil mister loan officer vocnoise 
youre gonna have a greater society to work with vocnoise and you wont have as 
many repossessions sil vocnoise im sorry it goes against your goal sil vocnoise sil but 
goes against sil vocnoise it sil its more positive for our society sil vocnoise and 
thats been it vocnoise my wifes been working part time sil all her vocnoise tenure 
thats fine keep her license up sil shes a nurse vocnoise the thing is vocnoise 
i dont sil want i didnt want her i wanted her to be home with 
the kids i didnt want somebody else to rear our kids sil vocnoise and i 
dont know vocnoise if our kids realize this or not sil but i do know 
my error my error my brother in law vocnoise mentioned to his uh parents he 
said sil gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us sil and he just 
turned fifty sil vocnoise and they dont have any kids vocnoise and he says vocnoise 
wow i dont know how you did it sil well for one thing they probably 
did sil a lot of sacrificing vocnoise and when you sacrifice vocnoise it becomes sil 
cutoffiit makes you more humble vocnoise iver sil and it makes you a error a 
better person sil because vocnoise you got the spirituality inside you driving you sil and 
thats whats gonna take you home sil vocnoise i often ask of people vocnoise uh 
vocnoise you ask me about marketing iver vocnoise cutoffhohow vocnoise uh do you think theres 
a heaven sil iver and how do you picture it sil iver yeah sil okay 
vocnoise see vocnoise the way i look at heaven sil myself is that vocnoise i 
have a chance to meet all my acquaintances i had over the past iver my 
family vocnoise noise sil vocnoise sil and ill see them face to face sil and 
ill recognize them sil and theyll recognize me vocnoise but sil something transcends them vocnoise 
because as i look to them vocnoise sil unlike when theyre on earth vocnoise my 
goodness were taught to learn vocnoise sil noise sil the most negative thing about person 
vocnoise sil psychology says if you see a blank sheet of paper you see the 
dot on the thing vocnoise you dont see the other ninety nine percent of the 
paper you see that dot sil its gonna be just the opposite in heaven vocnoise 
i cant think of a negative thing about you sil and the reason why you 
cant think of a negative thing about them vocnoise because vocnoise you see christs unknown 
appearance coming through them iver and they see the same thing its mirrored back to 
them vocnoise because were made in christs images sil and we cant say no to 
him sil vocnoise thats what heavens like thats what we should go to bed at 
night thinking vocnoise what did we do positive today vocnoise and build on the positive 
it may be the smallest part of that sheet of paper iver sil vocnoise i 
made a difference i helped someone sil i listened to someone sil vocnoise sil i 
just touched someone vocnoise sil vocnoise sil who will be successful vocnoise you will be 
successful errorindividual individual vocnoise and thats whats most critical vocnoise sil you yourself has vocnoise 
sil to do it sil vocnoise sil not the business vocnoise sil vocnoise because from 
you vocnoise sil vocnoise sil businesses observe vocnoise sil vocnoise sil iver sil noise sil

me to go full time and i just didnt feel like i wanted to go 
full time so sil i was working as a receptionist vocnoise sil and uh answering 
the phone doing some light filing just a variety of tasks office type tasks and

something the three of us can do together sil so im just iver sitting back 
waiting iver it was a nice birthday party iver laugh iver yeah i dont do 
a whole lot of it but i like to travel iver she cutoffththeres theres are 
wanderlust right there she travels all the time iver all by herself iver really iver 
umhum iver laughthe laugh particularly huh iver how many times youve been in ireland iver 
umhum iver you were sil you had to go home because sil mother was ill 
iver year later uhhuh iver hum iver umhum iver raised eleven iver laugh iver laugh 
iver laugh iver hum iver hum iver umhum iver those are unsettling times though sil 
yknow iver yeah iver laugh iver laugh iver did he really iver janet we just 
had a man who took time to cutoffsh iver walk us all the way through 
the hospital laughwalkusallthewaythroughthehospital iver laugh iver he sure was iver laugh iver laugh iver laugh 
iver laugh iver oh yeah iver umhum sil beer bottles sure do iver laugh iver 
laugh iver umhum iver theyre all sil um sil in business sil uh they work 
sil uh theyre vocnoise sil scattered sil i have a son in sacramento and a 
son uh in sil atlanta georgia sil vocnoise iver and then i have a daughter 
in tulsa oklahoma and i have a daughter in ruston virginia sil so they did 
theyre all cutoffmarriemarried well sil three are married yeah iver theyre sil they have a 
cutoffd sil very nice standard of living all of them do iver i have six 
sil umhum iver umhum iver i know iver i know it i know it but 
yknow there sil theres um three three of the family three of the children vocnoise 
have sil children sil and they each have two vocnoise sil theres a cutoffboboy sil 
a cutoffgigirl in each one the girl is the uh cutoffyyoungest uh oldest and then 
the boy sil second cutoffy sil and uh vocnoise sil thats good though and i 
hope and i know my son who isnt married right now sil hes um sil 
thirty one i know that he wants children very badly so sil so i should 
have probably end up with about eight or ten sil i would cutoffimaimagine sil i 
would imagine so iver grandchildren sil umhum sil yeah iver i thought was sil forty 
three iver oh iver laugh iver but iver they were iver sil they were all 
around the same age yknow and sil going to college sil my daughter julie does 
uh is very active though sil in um sil not necessarily that she sil has 
adopted two her two children vocnoise so shes become very active in the sil adoption 
procedure in tulsa vocnoise sil and uh iver oh okay okay sil uh yeah as 
far as the siblings go bernie is uh does charitable work iver dorothy sil uh 
sil has a lot of vocnoise grandchildren and a lot of children she has six 
children so vocnoise i think her family is her iver within her sil her life 
they she she does more with the children vocnoise because most of them live here 
sil yknow cutoffwwe our children are all away so iver we have the time iver 
oh i would be surprised iver interactive they are iver i think my daughter jennifer 
is very active uh sil um sil not so much sil um the sil the 
type of work that i do but i think shes very charitable sil very giving 
very um vocnoise iver umhum iver hum um sil hum um iver and her family 
iver hum um iver umhum iver i think i would say the same thing vocnoise 
because uh um sil course sil we had the benefit of having a mother sil 
who was very giving i mean cutoffl i think i learned a lot from sil 
her selflessness vocnoise sil and um sil vocnoise sil not only sil toward with us 
the children but sil vocnoise sil just to sil other also vocnoise yknow how mother 
used to feed the bums that would sil vocnoise cutoffffront up to front door and 
shed fix them food and so she she was a very iver hum iver i 
i know i wasnt iver umhum iver umhum iver i think example is probably the 
best sil vocnoise sil um sil they see that sil you care and sil they 
sil learn to care sil i think my son john hes the youngest i think 
hes a very compassionate soul vocnoise sil uh very spiritual young man sil um more 
so than his brother is vocnoise and excludethen i always have cutoffththat ah have to 
weigh that sil yknow they say that vocnoise sometimes sil you give because it sil 
makes you cutoffffeel you feel better to give vocnoise sil and i sometimes try to 
weigh that if sil thats part of why sil i sil i sil i sil 
i cant believe it its vocnoise an attention getter because sil theres nothing to be 
gained by sil getting attention for the works you do sil but sil um sil 
but maybe just within maybe one feels vocnoise sil um sil sil and i think 
cutoffwwe i think vocnoise it sil its a matter of being conscientious too sil yknow 
conscientious that there are vocnoise iver less fortunate out there and that sil cutoffl theres 
little things we can do iver i think thats kind of where im coming from 
janet i know you sil i janet cutoffjjanet sil i mean what sil my sister 
does cutoffahi i just say to her i just really admire it vocnoise i cant 
give as much as she gives i cant just dont have that same spirit she 
has but uh vocnoise sil errorisits great to see sil i mean shes real sil 
she really sil vocnoise sil when shes with sil the people vocnoise i dont know 
i have this sil thing probably about me that yknow you can stand on your 
own two feet and you can vocnoise sil lead a better life but janet just 
sil envelops them with her kindness and um sil probably has less expectations from sil 
the people she works with iver hum iver oh iver help them sil yeah iver 
umhum iver umhum iver laugh iver umhum iver umhum sil very much so umhum iver 
laugh laughi iver i do sil uhhuh sil yeah iver no i dont go to 
mass everyday but i go on sunday iver three three out of my four children 
do sil belong to the catholic church vocnoise sil and then my one daughter chose 
in living in oklahoma vocnoise sil she is sil in vocnoise a baptist church sil 
but shes very active within the church very active through the sunday school and sil 
through the womans group and iver vocnoise not really but i think living in the 
bible belt as she did she was sil living there ten years before she married 
vocnoise sil and uh got involved in a youth group vocnoise sil and i think 
that that was very influential on her decision and so she was married in the 
church all my other children were vocnoise sil but yknow sil shes vocnoise sil she 
is sil going her own path and thats fine with me shes very good girl 
and shes very sil conscientious and iver no not really i mean i would have 
preferred it of course vocnoise sil and i would prefer that she carried on the 
faith the same as sil the rest of the children did sil but no sil 
im sil im very happy and content with cutoffheher sil her decision sil yeah sil 
very much so vocnoise sil in cutoffffact as a matter of fact ironically julie the 
tulsan sil she and her husband both baptists sil they have both their children in 
a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool and its a vocnoise sil yes 
its its a catholic school environment so itll be interesting to see what evolves vocnoise 
from sil the childrens sil unknown uh sil attention to vocnoise the sil cutoffg the 
roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so iver oh i take 
the little ladies i take to church iver laugh iver theyre two elderly women that 
at the church cutoffababout it this has been about of seven or eight years ago 
vocnoise sil father just mentioned that they had sil a need vocnoise uh they had 
had a church bus and it had broken down so vocnoise they had a need 
for sil to get sil people to church and i met these two elderly women 
vocnoise sil now sil the one now is ninety she turned ninety last october and 
the other one is about excludeseventy sil eight sil now vocnoise sil and they live 
together and uh sil i take them to church on sunday iver laugh iver laughtakethemtothe 
grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday but 
vocnoise sil and i dont do it as regularly now because vocnoise of the advance 
in age yknow vocnoise iver and that theyre at the nazareth vocnoise nazareth towers which 
is good because they theyre sil they get better care there iver vocnoise iver laugh 
iver yeah iver theyre dear iver well its not every sunday anymore uh but it 
was for a long time it was for a long time iver very slow very 
methodical we take them to errordogdoctor my husbands taken them many times for vocnoise sil 
when they had to have cataract operations yknow so sil hes involved with the girls 
too iver oh yeah that was a that was a job helping them to move 
iver janet lou helped iver she helped a lot iver umhum iver doesnt bother me 
at all iver i see no sil i mean it it iver oh well iver 
i dont believe that iver absolutely iver absolutely iver that was a lot of old 
thinking sil iver there is very definitely iver i think theyve tried to to uh 
bring the laymen in sil to vocnoise sil more of the priest sil the duties 
of the priest vocnoise but theres like the consecration uh of the bread and wine 
that sil that none of that has been sanctioned vocnoise sil they dont perform they 
dont sil uh sil uh cutofft sil um theyre not able to give the sacramental 
graces for baptism confirmation vocnoise sil holy cutoffcomcommunion uh well they do holy communion vocnoise 
sil but uh extreme unction matrimony none of those vocnoise uh have been delegated outside 
of the duties of the priest vocnoise sil but sil um vocnoise sil i still 
think that its a good uh sil i do think the involvement of the laymen 
is very important vocnoise sil but i dont have any cutoffquaqualms sil i i mean 
that doesnt bother me a bit about women vocnoise iver huh sil uh iver well 
iver and i dont agree with that either iver umhum iver bar mitzvah iver laugh 
iver ive never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women 
arent priests is because they cutoffccant dont vocnoise show any kind of uh spiritual leadership 
vocnoise sil i sil ive never heard that said sil and cutoffsso there must be 
people who sil think that iver well when they had to cover their cutoffheheads i 
know all of that but i dont think thats really been iver umhum um iver 
i dont sil think so iver well thats true iver thats right iver and they 
say not as many european men attend mass but in in vocnoise sil at church 
yesterday i sil thought about that and i noticed how many men vocnoise sil there 
are who do go to church in the united states iver umhum iver umhum iver 
umhum iver umhum iver ive always thought that it it ends up being cutoffr sil 
a personal decision sil vocnoise sil yknow i i said to myself because i had 
post partem depression with my third and fourth child vocnoise sil and i thought it 
vocnoise sil vocnoise what good am my going to be to these children if im 
not able to take care of them sil vocnoise sil so sil decision was said 
sil after the fourth child we would practice birth control sil vocnoise so i and 
i felt comfortable that iver no because i think theres the ideal vocnoise sil in 
vocnoise everything vocnoise sil and vocnoise if you cant live up to that ideal standard 
but you do the best you can do sil and uh i think thats where 
i was coming from vocnoise sil i mean vocnoise even now vocnoise sil um sil 
vocnoise sil i mean i i could never sil agree with abortion lets say vocnoise 
sil i i would stand by the church and and most sil most of the 
church laws i do stand by vocnoise but i guess the birth control issue became 
so personal vocnoise sil and um sil it was just a decision that had to 
be made and i had to make it with a sil what i felt was 
a clear conscience and what i did sil i dont have any regrets for it 
vocnoise sil what about you iver i think it has a lot to do with 
the fact that the vocnoise that they sil the church iver yeah cutoffd cutofff cutoffproprocreation 
cutofft procreation part of sil what marriage is all about but i see marriage as 
sil more than just propagating iver so thats sil yknow sil cutoffbabased sil a lot 
of my decisions were based upon that iver they havent noise hum um iver right 
iver right iver well and dont you think too the cutoffpsychpsychologically that sil vocnoise sil 
the more they have found out psychologically speaking about vocnoise children and the placement of 
children in the family and the sil um sil throes of not having enough or 
vocnoise sil or being sil cutoffssorely sil sorely neglected because you were one of so 
many i mean janet and i both sil know the cutoffekexperience sil that experience from 
being vocnoise sil one of eleven children raised so yknow you didnt have the advantages 
that iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver right iver right sil vocnoise iver and 
of course i think too as in america the um sil the cutoffffarm sil farm 
families yknow they wanted sil that was more laborers for the vineyards so to speak 
so i think that might have influenced a lot of that vocnoise but over the 
years it it um sil it just made sense to me vocnoise sil in fact 
it vocnoise looks like in my family that theyre cutofft going sil the children are 
going to be mostly in twos vocnoise sil yknow not even going to three or 
four sil i mean errorisits sil not over yet but my girls are forty two 
and sil forty one vocnoise sil soon to be forty one so um vocnoise sil 
i think that their child bearing years are over iver umhum iver umhum iver oh 
iver i know iver oh my gosh iver yeah iver see there i think there 
has to be a quality to life too vocnoise sil and iver hum iver its 
very hard iver that was your youth sil and thats good i mean iver thats 
good to be there iver laugh iver laugh iver laugh iver laugh iver excludeonetwothreefourfivesixseveneightnineteneleventwelvethirteenfourteenfifteensixteenseventeeneighteennineteentwenty iver

vocnoise um vocnoise like vocnoise one of my friends sil he had um sil a 
car alarm sil because he had some nice stuff in his car vocnoise his car

on your time sit down vocnoise he got all his stuff stolen out of his 
car vocnoise its like vocnoise well sil there that went yknow vocnoise unknown why vocnoise 
i mean you cant even have nice stuff in your car anymore vocnoise i dont

military and then they started vocnoise popping up all this vocnoise abuse stuff and i 
was like sil man vocnoise darn laugh vocnoise its like my aunt iver his vocnoise 
sil my boyfriends vocnoise aunt and uncle they vocnoise their vocnoise their kid is sil 
has that sil really hyperness um vocnoise iver a d h d vocnoise and um 
vocnoise they do this vocnoise they were trying to make it to where they vocnoise 
he would calm down and they wouldnt hafta give him so much medicine vocnoise and 
she reads a lot of magazines and vocnoise articles about sil yknow the problem vocnoise 
and um sil i guess uh vocnoise he cutoffhahad sil uh sil if you change 
their diet if you take out milk or something i think it was vocnoise did 
you know twizzlers had milk in them iver you cutoffdidid i cutoffnnever iver oh really 
vocnoise i was like vocnoise whoa milk in twizzlers iver whoa vocnoise um iver that 
that vocnoise its like whoa vocnoise milk is in vocnoise and um vocnoise so they 
change his um vocnoise diet around and watch i mean theyre only vocnoise right now 
theyre eating vocnoise theyre on a vocnoise organic vocnoise diet vocnoise now i dont know 
if i could afford that but um vocnoise laugh iver i would think it would

but its kind of wintery now so laugh cant grow nothing right now laugh um 
iver it kind of laughyeah laugh vocnoise laugh well ive seen worser laughso laugh vocnoise 
um sil so i vocnoise theyre doing this sil vocnoise i think its called sit

i was born on a homestead vocnoise out hesin vocnoise northern montana vocnoise and then 
my parents moved back to iowa which was their vocnoise home vocnoise area vocnoise southern 
iowa vocnoise and i grew up there vocnoise attended high school there vocnoise and then 
i uh vocnoise went to iowa state for five quarters and vocnoise sil i just 
vocnoise didnt get it vocnoise and hesthen uh vocnoise i worked around home for a 
vocnoise a year and then i cutoffwewent vocnoise went into the army in vocnoise nineteen 
forty vocnoise spring of nineteen forty one before pearl harbor vocnoise and i was in 
hesthe vocnoise service for uh vocnoise sil vocnoise four and a half years vocnoise in 
vocnoise italy most of that time cutoffnornorth vocnoise north africa and then italy vocnoise and 
uh vocnoise sil vocnoise i vocnoise noise vocnoise noise had met a vocnoise uh a 
cutoffggirl vocnoise uh girl before i went in the service and vocnoise so when i 
got sil home why we were married and vocnoise she had family out here in 
columbus vocnoise iver she was originally from southern ohio vocnoise sil but uh vocnoise when 
i was gone she came vocnoise to columbus and so vocnoise i came here when 
i was discharged sil vocnoise and i uh vocnoise served an apprenticeship in a sheet 
metal worker shop vocnoise or well vocnoise it was vocnoise more than just i mean 
theres more than shop work we did vocnoise erection work too and commercial work vocnoise 
and uh vocnoise sil i stayed with that until uh vocnoise sil vocnoise well for 
twenty five years however laugh whenever that was vocnoise then i got a chance to 
uh vocnoise go to work for the city of columbus as a cutoffheaheating heating and 
ventilating inspector vocnoise and i decided that it was vocnoise sil that was more my 
speed when i was that age so vocnoise i worked for them vocnoise for the 
city as a vocnoise inspector for vocnoise twelve and a half years vocnoise till i 
retired vocnoise and uh vocnoise my wife and i had vocnoise sil vocnoise four children 
vocnoise four vocnoise or three boys and a daughter vocnoise unknown vocnoise my sons all

my life iver vocnoise and uh vocnoise sil tried to get my vocnoise family vocnoise

but uh vocnoise i think theyre all vocnoise responsible vocnoise well adjusted people and vocnoise 
have families of their own i have vocnoise nine grandchildren vocnoise one great grandson vocnoise 
and uh vocnoise sil and the boys are all in the sheet metal trade also 
vocnoise one of thems working over here on the vocnoise sil the uh stadium vocnoise 
iver and uh iver vocnoise i dont know just exactly where the others are but 
theyre cutoffworworking vocnoise cutoffhehere here in the vocnoise columbus area iver vocnoise my daughters a 
school teacher whos been vocnoise teaching vocnoise for vocnoise sil noise vocnoise i dont know 
ever since she got her degree iver sil vocnoise and vocnoise her husband works for 
a vocnoise sil vocnoise a uh vocnoise testing vocnoise company vocnoise that vocnoise does vocnoise 
testing with uh vocnoise i dont know very much about it laugh probably shouldnt even 
say vocnoise but cutoffe vocnoise cutoffuultra cutoffultraviultraviolet uh with uh vocnoise ultra or sil vocnoise 
something or other ultrasound vocnoise equipment iver vocnoise and vocnoise its really sort of interesting 
iver vocnoise and lets see vocnoise sil vocnoise my vocnoise my youngest sons wife is 
a vocnoise teacher in the sil catholic schools elementary schools vocnoise and vocnoise my cutoffssecond 
vocnoise my second sons wife vocnoise sil vocnoise works vocnoise sil vocnoise for the vocnoise 
columbus school vocnoise system vocnoise as a secretary and vocnoise uh vocnoise actually transcribing notes 
for vocnoise noise people vocnoise who uh for men whove vocnoise noise are vocnoise writing 
books or papers or whatever iver and then uh vocnoise my vocnoise oldest sons vocnoise 
wife is vocnoise a secretary cutoffffor vocnoise in the sil vocnoise in the school iver 
in a vocnoise shes vocnoise works cutoffiin vocnoise in a school building and vocnoise laughshe 
vocnoise she hears all the sil vocnoise troubles and noise laugh iver vocnoise sad stories 
vocnoise sil extoh lets see vocnoise sil vocnoise i dont know vocnoise thats basically laugh 
who i am iver vocnoise iver hum iver yeah iver well vocnoise i we were 
in north africa first vocnoise for the north african vocnoise campaign when rommel was still 
vocnoise roaming and then vocnoise when uh vocnoise that ended up vocnoise in the summer 
of vocnoise sil vocnoise fall of nineteen forty two i believe vocnoise and uh vocnoise 
then we cutoffwwe sil vocnoise were sent to italy i was in the field artillery 
outfits vocnoise uh six inch guns iver vocnoise and uh vocnoise well actually vocnoise a 
neighbor boy vocnoise whose vocnoise draft number was vocnoise smaller than mine iver vocnoise uh 
vocnoise i dont know where he got the contact but anyway vocnoise he vocnoise went 
up to boone iowa and joined a national guard outfit vocnoise uh vocnoise which was 
field artillery vocnoise and uh vocnoise with the expectation of their being mobilized vocnoise soon 
vocnoise which they were vocnoise and uh vocnoise so he vocnoise he was home one 
weekend and talked to me about it and i thought well vocnoise field artillery i 
was exposed to that when i was uh vocnoise in r o t c at 
ames vocnoise so i thought thats sil be better than vocnoise carrying a rifle and 
laugh so i went up with him and i joined up vocnoise and uh vocnoise 
so anyway vocnoise we errorhandhad vocnoise six inch vocnoise howitzers vocnoise which had a range 
of vocnoise about sixteen miles vocnoise and uh vocnoise the shells were vocnoise about ninety 
five pounds iver vocnoise and they vocnoise the high explosive shells had thirty seven pounds 
of t n t in them vocnoise so theyd make vocnoise quite a bang when 
they went off iver and vocnoise field artillery is really cutoffinterinteresting or i found it 
really interesting because vocnoise those uh vocnoise when you get into figuring vocnoise firing data 
vocnoise iver vocnoise laughyoucan vocnoise get lost in mathematics almost back then you could of 
course vocnoise now they probably have iver computers that vocnoise figure it out and just 
zip zip vocnoise and uh vocnoise sil vocnoise oh vocnoise sil vocnoise and then they 
uh vocnoise we had to vocnoise locate our positions on a map iver and vocnoise 
i didnt do that myself vocnoise but we had a couple boys in the outfit 
who vocnoise sil could vocnoise uh vocnoise find where we were on a map and 
vocnoise sil where our vocnoise o p our observation post was and vocnoise where the 
enemy out here was and all that vocnoise and uh vocnoise its uh vocnoise it 
cutoffrereally it is cutoffinterinteresting was interesting vocnoise uh vocnoise calculating vocnoise trying to calculate vocnoise 
where your shells were gonna land out there iver i was up cutoffoon vocnoise i 
was vocnoise only on the o p a few times but vocnoise one time when 
we vocnoise had a uh vocnoise second lieutenant up there who was very vocnoise sil 
well congenial i guess is as good a word as any iver and uh vocnoise 
what wed do is sometimes vocnoise when wed get into an area and wed know 
that wed had a field out here wed be shooting to vocnoise we would adjust 
on a target out there wed pick a vocnoise iver a building or some target 
there we could see iver vocnoise and wed vocnoise cutoffadadjust adjust the guns call down 
vocnoise shifts vocnoise until they could come within vocnoise reasonable vocnoise close to that vocnoise 
iver and then vocnoise we wed know where vocnoise to shift from there to another 
target iver vocnoise and uh vocnoise he let me fire it vocnoise one laugh once 
vocnoise range but vocnoise i got about vocnoise sil vocnoise fifty or seventy five yards 
from the vocnoise what we were shooting laughat iver which would vocnoise um vocnoise see 
with those vocnoise guns our of ours we figured vocnoise within ten cutoffffeet vocnoise ten 
yards was a hit vocnoise was a cutofftartarget vocnoise and because vocnoise if you had 
one of those things vocnoise thirty seven vocnoise pounds of t n t go off 
within ten yards of it laugh iver yeah vocnoise iver we iver we had uh 
vocnoise counter battery fire we called it which vocnoise when they were shooting back at 
us vocnoise once vocnoise in north africa was vocnoise sil vocnoise kind of vocnoise scary 
vocnoise uh vocnoise we were in position where we vocnoise sil could fire on a 
vocnoise a uh tank battle that was going on we had a errorforalforward vocnoise forward 
observer up there vocnoise where he could look down and see the whole thing vocnoise 
and so he was adjusting fire and vocnoise i dont know how many vocnoise tanks 
they claimed that we hit but iver vocnoise course with ours vocnoise if you hit 
vocnoise you didnt have to hit them direct you could hit them right beside them 
and flip them over iver and they were out of it iver vocnoise so uh 
anyway vocnoise extwe vocnoise we had a fine field day that one day vocnoise uh 
firing at them vocnoise sil vocnoise the next morning about ten o clock vocnoise we 
heard one cutofft cutoffcocome uh heard a shell coming in and it was an air 
burst back of us about five hundred yards iver vocnoise and then in a little 
bit theres another one vocnoise other side of us iver he was adjusting on us 
vocnoise and we vocnoise sil couldnt do we didnt catch onto where it was right 
away but vocnoise by the time we vocnoise started vocnoise looking for our laugh holes 
which vocnoise werent deep enough vocnoise we vocnoise cutofff realized that he was in a 
clump of vocnoise cutoffs of cactus iver over on an adjoining hill vocnoise oh about 
vocnoise half a mile away i guess vocnoise and he was getting even for the 
day before iver but uh vocnoise laughthe vocnoise the first lieutenant who was vocnoise our 
um vocnoise in command of the battery at that time vocnoise said lets get the 
hell out of here iver so vocnoise there was a vocnoise a wadi they call 
them its like a vocnoise little deep wash iver that vocnoise ran down vocnoise oh 
a hundred two hundred yards from the gun position so vocnoise we took off down 
there iver vocnoise and they vocnoise proceeded to set vocnoise sil i think they set 
two of our guns on vocnoise the battery i mean the vocnoise tires on fire 
iver vocnoise and they set the ammunition on fire vocnoise they just vocnoise shot our 
gun position up pretty good vocnoise and uh vocnoise and that night vocnoise finally they 
vocnoise well i dont know exactly how we vocnoise we got a hold of back 
to our headquarters but anyway we did and vocnoise so they sent the vocnoise prime 
movers vocnoise which vocnoise the vocnoise the trucks which we moved the guns with vocnoise 
out vocnoise and uh vocnoise we hitched what was cutoffremremaining remaining vocnoise of the guns 
on them and vocnoise went back wondering now laugh they gonna put us in the 
infantry or something we dont have any vocnoise artillery guns vocnoise but uh vocnoise i 
dont know it wasnt but vocnoise a couple or three days vocnoise they had vocnoise 
more guns i mean more artillery pieces up there for us to vocnoise use vocnoise 
and then vocnoise one other time after in italy vocnoise or when we were in 
italy vocnoise we cutoffmomoved they moved us into a position that we should have never 
been in vocnoise we were vocnoise well lets see we come cutoffaloalong uh around a 
mountain like theres a mountain here iver vocnoise and there not a vocnoise real cutoffbbig 
high mountain but a mountain vocnoise and in the front of it there was a 
little kind of a vocnoise dip iver vocnoise and then on out and the vocnoise 
enemy was over there vocnoise well they put us in the front of that mountain 
right down vocnoise iver extwhere sil vocnoise i dont think that theres any question they 
could look right down our throats because vocnoise and anyway we fired a vocnoise a 
couple times from there vocnoise and they cutoffsstarted started firing back at us and man 
vocnoise scared me iver i had my vocnoise my head was that far below the 
surface laugh iver in a hole and i was still vocnoise uh shaken vocnoise but 
uh vocnoise and i dont remember vocnoise i think they put one of our guns 
out of commission that time but they didnt do vocnoise as much damage as vocnoise 
they might have iver vocnoise those were the two worst vocnoise iver vocnoise things vocnoise 
when we were in north africa vocnoise there was vocnoise sil one vocnoise german gun 
that was vocnoise firing on us and vocnoise and they couldnt figure where he was 
iver vocnoise and finally uh i dont know whether there were vocnoise we had uh 
a vocnoise piper cub observation plane i dont know whether he saw him vocnoise or 
vocnoise who but anyway vocnoise they finally vocnoise figured that he was in a vocnoise 
a cutoffrairail a tunnel for the railroad iver and hed iver pull out iver fire 
a couple rounds pull right back in vocnoise so uh vocnoise that night our captain 
who vocnoise whos one of these vocnoise go go guys vocnoise took one of our 
guns from a gun crew vocnoise sil vocnoise they went up to where they could 
vocnoise line cutoffs vocnoise cutofff vocnoise line cutofff vocnoise aim on that vocnoise iver opening 
of that tunnel vocnoise and laughthey vocnoise fired a couple vocnoise sil of our shells 
into the tunnel and then took off iver so i dont know vocnoise whether cutoffththey 
laugh they did any damage or not but iver if there were any germans in 
there ill bet they scared laughthem laugh iver no iver no we we vocnoise the 
uh the only germans i ever saw were vocnoise cutoffpriprisoners cutoffpriprisoners p o ws iver 
uhhuh iver vocnoise iver vocnoise well we vocnoise we went in vocnoise at naples iver 
which is pretty well to the south cutoffeend vocnoise end of italy vocnoise and we 
went up vocnoise through the vocnoise mountains we didnt see cutoffaany vocnoise well vocnoise went 
up to uh vocnoise lets see now vocnoise well we went uh vocnoise about half 
way up to vocnoise between naples and rome vocnoise iver and we were stopped at 
vocnoise one of their defensive lines iver and uh vocnoise then vocnoise they vocnoise powers 
that be yknow vocnoise american army decided well vocnoise well go up to sil vocnoise 
sil this little area of uh vocnoise oh i was there six months or four 
months vocnoise anzio vocnoise iver youve heard of the anzio beachhead vocnoise well go up 
there vocnoise and get around behind them iver vocnoise and uh so they went up 
there vocnoise but the germans vocnoise caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty 
hot vocnoise and that vocnoise area vocnoise of anzio was vocnoise just flat as this 
table almost vocnoise for an area vocnoise back from the cutoffmmediterranean vocnoise mediterranean back probably 
vocnoise ten miles vocnoise theres ten or twelve miles vocnoise unknown long the coast long 
vocnoise and uh vocnoise so we the vocnoise we had enough area to vocnoise errormadipmanipulate 
vocnoise manipulate in vocnoise and it was crisscrossed with deep vocnoise uh vocnoise uh vocnoise 
ditches of some kind i dont know whether they were vocnoise irrigation ditches or what 
vocnoise which we used as sil fortification iver vocnoise but uh vocnoise but even so 
vocnoise the uh vocnoise we were on this and the vocnoise germans were up on 
the mountains all around us where they could vocnoise again look right down at us 
vocnoise so we didnt go out in the daylight hardly at all iver vocnoise and 
then uh vocnoise after so long a time after vocnoise i dont know how long 
vocnoise they vocnoise again the powers that be said well vocnoise well fool them well 
vocnoise fog up that whole area with smoke iver vocnoise and as long as the 
wind wasnt too vocnoise high vocnoise well they could do it vocnoise mean you vocnoise 
they cutoffffogged vocnoise fogged it up to where you could hardly see your hand out 
here iver vocnoise that way well at least we could move around a little bit 
vocnoise but uh vocnoise iver we sat there then vocnoise for vocnoise oh and vocnoise 
it was kind of funny vocnoise noise vocnoise we were cutoffgogoing uh theres vocnoise another 
guy and i and vocnoise noise the vocnoise the lieutenant who was cutoffaan vocnoise forward 
observer vocnoise were going out to a vocnoise forward errorobserveobservation vocnoise observation post and vocnoise 
they uh vocnoise observation vocnoise lieutenant whatever his cutoffpposition title was vocnoise was guiding he 
was in one jeep ahead of us and we were following him vocnoise and of 
course we just had these little vocnoise red vocnoise blackout lights they called them vocnoise 
iver we were following his jeep vocnoise we kept going and we kept going and 
vocnoise this other g i and i were sitting in the back and i said 
hey vocnoise suppose they know the german laughpassword laugh laughbut vocnoise but uh vocnoise anyway 
vocnoise they finally got out vocnoise we finally out out to where there was a 
bunch of vocnoise ruined farm cutoffhouhouses vocnoise or cutofffafarm ruined farm house and farm buildings 
and so on vocnoise and uh vocnoise they said well this is it vocnoise so 
uh vocnoise extwe there and there were some vocnoise g is vocnoise error vocnoise infantry 
men around there and vocnoise sil vocnoise so uh vocnoise sil vocnoise we started looking 
around for a place to land i mean vocnoise got our bed rolls out vocnoise 
so on and vocnoise the next morning vocnoise i dont know i guess i was 
looking for a vocnoise somebody who had a fire there warm up some vocnoise some 
uh rice and something vocnoise anyway vocnoise one of the first guys i saw vocnoise 
was a guy that had worked with my wife in the office there vocnoise iver 
and uh vocnoise so vocnoise i got some of the inside dope vocnoise on uh 
the area from him vocnoise but uh vocnoise they had vocnoise theres a vocnoise i 
dont know whether it been a large grainery or something that had a concrete floor 
vocnoise and some vocnoise industrious g i had vocnoise chipped a hole about vocnoise so 
big around in that vocnoise iver and dug out the dirt under it iver so 
that he got down in a vocnoise an area under that concrete floor vocnoise the 
concrete was about so deep which iver better than that much dirt vocnoise laughanduh vocnoise 
so uh vocnoise whenever they vocnoise we heard any vocnoise firing like it was coming 
toward us why vocnoise wed laugh head for that hole iver vocnoise oh lets see 
vocnoise ive already told you more than i ever told anybody else i think iver 
vocnoise oh iver at cutoffananzio at anzio you said oh iver uhhuh iver yeah iver 
yeah iver yeah iver one of my kids got it for me vocnoise iver vocnoise 
it vocnoise i dont know vocnoise laughmakesourgenerations laugh laughsoundlikeheroes laugh vocnoise and iver laugh iver 
well i dont think he vocnoise exaggerated but he uh vocnoise he was selective about 
the people that he iver vocnoise he described in there iver which vocnoise vocnoisewasthe vocnoise 
purpose of his book i suppose iver vocnoise uh vocnoise and of course bill mauldin 
was vocnoise the greatest vocnoise laughimean laugh vocnoise you cutoffgogot have you seen his vocnoise 
cartoons and vocnoise uh havent you iver well he vocnoise his two main cutoffcarcartoons uh 
vocnoise main characters in his cartoons were willie and joe iver two vocnoise g is 
iver and uh vocnoise oh laughthey vocnoise laughthey vocnoise they saw the vocnoise the ragged 
end of the war iver according to that vocnoise and vocnoise so uh vocnoise i 
cant think what some of their observations were but vocnoise theres usually just one or 
two vocnoise lines of iver of dialogue under one of their vocnoise their cartoons and 
the cartoon told vocnoise most of it iver vocnoise laughand laugh there was one vocnoise 
where they were going along and vocnoise theres a little vocnoise uh vocnoise scroungey looking 
dog about so long and about that high kind of following along after them vocnoise 
sil joe vocnoise im glad that i finally vocnoise see somebody i can be sorry 
for thats worse erroraraoff worse off than i laugham iver what iver vocnoise under the 
conditions that had to prevail i was treated well enough iver vocnoise it was uh 
vocnoise part of the time iver sil vocnoise i dont feel like ive vocnoise sil 
gained anything from it that i didnt deserve i mean iver in the way of 
sil vocnoise benefits iver huh iver well that and vocnoise see uh vocnoise they had 
the g i bill of rights iver which was vocnoise a boon to vocnoise thousands 
and thousands of guys my age iver and vocnoise when i started as an apprentice 
vocnoise in the shop they said well vocnoise well start you at a dollar an 
hour vocnoise well i thought that sounds pretty good yknow in nineteen forty five vocnoise 
in the fall of nineteen forty five vocnoise so then vocnoise as things worked out 
in washington d c vocnoise they came out with the g i bill of rights 
vocnoise we found out that uh that would apply to apprentices too iver and so 
uh vocnoise soon as my vocnoise shop found out that i could vocnoise draw that 
vocnoise whole vocnoise ninety dollars a month iver i mean whoo vocnoise they said well 
vocnoise since youre getting that vocnoise why well vocnoise cut vocnoise cut your pay back 
to what vocnoise you would vocnoise normally draw under the apprenticeship program iver which was 
fifty seven cents an hour iver and vocnoise sil vocnoise for a vocnoise to support 
a wife and a errorwallsmall small baby on that was laugh vocnoise kind of tough 
going iver well iver uh vocnoise i was vocnoise exposed to a lot of vocnoise 
men who were not vocnoise brought up with as i was vocnoise but there were 
a lot of them that were iver i mean uh vocnoise like uh vocnoise whats 
his name that who wrote the book you just iver yeah vocnoise uh vocnoise i 
was vocnoise i think that hes vocnoise hes right that our vocnoise my generation vocnoise 
was vocnoise extmore uh vocnoise sil vocnoise oh vocnoise noise vocnoise i want to dont 
want to say spiritual but more morally vocnoise uh vocnoise well directed than vocnoise at 
least a lot of the cutoffpepeople kids today iver i dont say that of all 
of the noisekids because i know that vocnoise some of them vocnoise were sil brought 
up right iver but uh vocnoise iver sil well i was vocnoise uh vocnoise noise 
sil vocnoise i vocnoise i was pretty well vocnoise established about responsibility and vocnoise that 
sort of thing before i went into service vocnoise i was the oldest son in 
a family of ten vocnoise iver so uh vocnoise sil noise i had some vocnoise 
family responsibilities vocnoise we were vocnoise my brother and i and my sisters vocnoise were 
active in the four h clubs iver which was a vocnoise a going thing iver 
at that noisetime vocnoise in the uh vocnoise thirties iver vocnoise and uh vocnoise and 
did i say we vocnoise went to church sil fairly regularly but vocnoise to tell 
you the truth i cant vocnoise remember too much that i laughwas taught then laughbut 
laugh vocnoise but i was exposed to it anyway and im vocnoise im sure that 
some of it vocnoise rubbed off on me iver vocnoise iver well vocnoise uh my 
youngest son vocnoise married a catholic girl who was vocnoise from a large catholic family 
vocnoise and vocnoise their kids are going to a catholic school iver now i think 
that vocnoise those four kids at least among my grandchildren vocnoise are vocnoise getting pretty 
much at the same vocnoise training that i did or maybe better than i got 
vocnoise uh vocnoise my oldest sons two daughters vocnoise sil extare vocnoise well theyre good 
kids and theyre smart kids vocnoise but i dont think that they have the vocnoise 
sil vocnoise moral grounding vocnoise that uh vocnoise greg and beths kids do vocnoise you 
said this is all confidential laugh iver vocnoise and my vocnoise but now my daughters 
vocnoise my daughter has twin sons vocnoise who just vocnoise are a year out of 
vocnoise college vocnoise and uh vocnoise i think that they are vocnoise cutoffwone noise cutoffwone 
they vocnoise one of them particularly is vocnoise i think in noise vocnoise good moral 
vocnoise good sort of guy and vocnoise the other one vocnoise i dont feel like 
i know as well but vocnoise i vocnoise i really think that theyre noise both 
vocnoise good noise sil and uh vocnoise see vocnoise uh vocnoise sil vocnoise noise vocnoise 
iver noise iver sil iver i cant iver vocnoise i dont know vocnoise i vocnoise 
i think vocnoise those kids are uh vocnoise theyre lack something in their upbringing vocnoise 
and i dont know what it is vocnoise um vocnoise thank goodness none of my 
kids ever noise took that sort of attitude vocnoise and uh vocnoise id like to 
vocnoise id like to think that my wife and i sil set them a good 
example vocnoise my wife was a vocnoise uh vocnoise very conscientious vocnoise hard working woman 
vocnoise she vocnoise established a vocnoise secretarial vocnoise business there at our cutoffhahome vocnoise uh 
vocnoise for several years vocnoise and uh vocnoise anything that went out of there was 
vocnoise right vocnoise i mean laugh vocnoise and uh vocnoise she did vocnoise well quite 
a lot of typing for students over here graduate students iver sil and vocnoise so 
she i gave her most uh vocnoise credit for iver our kids upbringing vocnoise her 
mother vocnoise was a vocnoise cousin of uh vocnoise james thurber iver and vocnoise was 
a vocnoise a cutoffwwant a want to be writer i cutoffr mean her mother was 
vocnoise she vocnoise she wrote a vocnoise well she wrote quite a number of poems 
and vocnoise and sil paid to have them published in a small booklet vocnoise and 
some of sil some of them were sil vocnoise real good and some of them 
vocnoise and vocnoise my wife vocnoise wrote some poetry too vocnoise shed be down there 
typing vocnoise and shed vocnoise she always had these uh noise spiral notebooks vocnoise and 
shed vocnoise stop and vocnoise get an idea for a poem maybe from something she 
is working on or i dont know what but vocnoise but anyway uh vocnoise she 
cutoffdidid she wrote vocnoise quite a few poems some of them vocnoise real good poetry 
i thought vocnoise most of them of cutoffs sil more or less a vocnoise religious 
nature sil and sil moral nature vocnoise in fact uh vocnoise i cutoffs sil uh 
the sil desk that vocnoise she had we vocnoise we finished off part of our 
basement she had her office down there vocnoise and uh vocnoise her desk is still 
down there and vocnoise one of the typewriters that she used but its vocnoise i 
dont know its been disused too for too long i guess because ive tried type 
on it vocnoise it uh sil doesnt shift like it should and so uh vocnoise 
but anyway vocnoise she hadnt vocnoise i dont know vocnoise how many these spiral notebooks 
around vocnoise and shed just write in them vocnoise and uh vocnoise since she passed 
away in nineteen seventy nine vocnoise i have run across vocnoise i sil well i 
just cutofffifinally finally decided well those notebooks are down there and vocnoise if i need 
one for something ill just vocnoise go ahead and use it vocnoise and ive sil 
run across a couple of her poems that i didnt vocnoise know anything about iver 
and then was vocnoise or uh vocnoise sort of sil good iver uh huh iver 
yeah iver huh iver i think so vocnoise although vocnoise she was sil working at 
her vocnoise desk most of the time so that vocnoise she didnt give them as 
much attention as iver as uh vocnoise a lot of mothers do vocnoise but vocnoise 
she was there vocnoise and if they needed her vocnoise for anything or vocnoise needed 
her to say no to something laugh vocnoise she was there vocnoise and uh vocnoise 
yeah i think that uh vocnoise that probably had something to do with it vocnoise 
and the fact that our kids knew vocnoise what sil our moral beliefs were iver 
and uh vocnoise my oldest son vocnoise uh completed sil what they call the god 
and country award in the church vocnoise which is vocnoise erroracroiarequires uh vocnoise requires about 
as much vocnoise work as uh sil eagle award sil in the scouts sil its 
a vocnoise a scout sponsored but church centered vocnoise uh award vocnoise and then my 
cutoffssecond second son vocnoise got a his eagle award in the scouts vocnoise im vocnoise 
kind of proud of that vocnoise because it vocnoise uh vocnoise well its not something 
that a lot of kids do yknow iver laugh iver my oldest son vocnoise was 
in vietnam iver yeah vocnoise in fact vocnoise he uh vocnoise lets see i sil 
i cutoffsposuppose i dont remember but i suppose that they vocnoise had a draft vocnoise 
when he was about twenty one iver anyway he vocnoise he went in for sil 
less than a year i think and then he was discharged vocnoise and then he 
was called back sil in sil and vocnoise sent to vietnam vocnoise and it was 
uh vocnoise sort of a traumatic experience for him vocnoise that i think he has 
pretty well come out of but vocnoise he was in a sil rural area he 
never was vocnoise up where he was doing any shooting himself vocnoise but uh vocnoise 
he was on k p one day vocnoise and uh vocnoise he said they had 
a big vocnoise an area vocnoise out away from any of the other buildings where 
they burned trash and that sort of stuff vocnoise so cutoffhhe he said the vocnoise 
mess sergeant says um vocnoise shoemaker take that vocnoise can of trash out and uh 
vocnoise and burn it and you sil probably better use vocnoise take some gasoline to 
throw on the stuff vocnoise to get it to burn vocnoise so he did he 
went out there vocnoise and vocnoise threw some gasoline on it vocnoise not vocnoise knowing 
that one of the other cutoffkk vocnoise k ps had been there ahead of him 
vocnoise and thrown gasoline on it so there was vocnoise i dont know how much 
gasoline on it vocnoise when he threw a match on it iver it vocnoise burned 
his vocnoise his front anyway vocnoise he got his hands up in front of his 
face so it didnt vocnoise burn his face but it vocnoise burned his legs and 
his sil stomach iver and uh vocnoise so he was in a hospital in vocnoise 
japan for some time vocnoise and then noise came home vocnoise but uh vocnoise he 
never sil would never say a lot about it iver but he just vocnoise didnt 
have a very high opinion of the army iver and then vocnoise a couple of 
years later vocnoise he was working on a job in vocnoise the columbus coated fabrics 
plant which is vocnoise plant that makes vocnoise unknownown vocnoise coated fabrics vocnoise they make 
sil uh vocnoise the main thing is uh auto upholstery car upholstery vocnoise anyway vocnoise 
they had big vocnoise rolling machines that sil rolled this stuff out vocnoise and theres 
fumes came off of it vocnoise so they had vocnoise a big hood and exhaust 
system iver above it vocnoise and periodically they would have to clean those out because 
uh vocnoise the fan would draw in addition to fumes theyd draw some lint off 
of this uh vocnoise so he was up on top on these rollers vocnoise cleaning 
out the hood vocnoise and vocnoise with supposedly vocnoise nonflammable sil solvent iver but it 
wasnt because it caught sil fire vocnoise and that time he was burned on the 
back iver laugh hed been burned laugh front and back vocnoise he was in the 
hospital burn ward for vocnoise i dont know vocnoise two or three weeks vocnoise and 
it vocnoise it was um vocnoise the year that vocnoise one of the years that 
vocnoise ohio state played in the rose bowl now laugh vocnoise thats the nearest i 
can uh vocnoise identify the time vocnoise but uh vocnoise and vocnoise the cutofftitime during 
the time that he was there vocnoise a girl who he cutoffbbeen hed been going 
with just vocnoise occasionally not real steady vocnoise was there to see him every day 
iver laughandso vocnoise when vocnoise shortly after he vocnoise was healed enough to go back 
to work sil why vocnoise they were married iver iver vocnoise and had the two 
daughters iver hum iver oh yeah iver thats too true vocnoise its uh iver hum 
iver well vocnoise the vocnoise objectives in vietnam vocnoise were never vocnoise clearly delineated iver 
and they were in italy vocnoise and europe vocnoise and uh vocnoise there wasnt vocnoise 
the definite vocnoise enemy vocnoise in vietnam that there was in europe vocnoise i think 
thats part of it vocnoise noise and of course the attitude of most of the 
vocnoise guys that went to vietnam was vocnoise a little bit different from vocnoise from 
where i was probably is a consequence of vocnoise our understanding of the vocnoise the 
uh iver objectives vocnoise because uh vocnoise when we went noise into the service and 
then went overseas our vocnoise objective was to vocnoise do away with hitler and mussolini 
vocnoise and uh vocnoise i dont know they vocnoise im just thankful that he vocnoise 
he wasnt in a vocnoise carrying a rifle in a rifle company or something because 
vocnoise that was rough iver noise he uh vocnoise told he never said much about 
it except he vocnoise told about vocnoise one time when he was in the vocnoise 
hospital vocnoise up in japan vocnoise after he was burned vocnoise he said that he 
was in a vocnoise ward with a bunch of other vocnoise burn patients and vocnoise 
and he said the vocnoise some of them and him included vocnoise were able to 
get up and walk around vocnoise so the vocnoise and i can see their philosophy 
the vocnoise medics vocnoise had the guys that could walk vocnoise help wait on the 
vocnoise guys that were bed bound vocnoise and uh vocnoise he was vocnoise had been 
helping vocnoise one guy that was vocnoise pretty bad off noise vocnoise and this guy 
passed away vocnoise didnt make it vocnoise and so they vocnoise started to put orrin 
get warren to vocnoise do something else cutoffwwith vocnoise with some of the other guys 
vocnoise im through im not working anymore with them he told them vocnoise and they 
swore yes you are vocnoise he said what are you gonna do send me back 
over to vietnam laugh vocnoise but they sent him home vocnoise but he was vocnoise 
he was uh vocnoise noise vocnoise not a very enthusiastic soldier i dont think at 
any time and vocnoise especially after he came home iver now what iver yeah iver 
well vocnoise i dont think that women should be on the front lines vocnoise uh 
vocnoise some women vocnoise are cutoffphysphsically vocnoise are physically able to do vocnoise whats needed 
vocnoise some definitely arent vocnoise of course theres a vocnoise same by the same token 
some men arent vocnoise but uh vocnoise as cutoffaas as support vocnoise groups i think 
thats all right iver huh iver yeah iver i never heard a thing about it 
all the time i was in the service iver vocnoise and i dont know vocnoise 
whether orrin did or not hes never said anything if he has vocnoise but uh 
vocnoise i think my attitude would be vocnoise uh vocnoise dont tell and vocnoise you 
know vocnoise uh vocnoise the vocnoise the guys that cutoffcocome vocnoise come out in a 
very errorvocishouvociferous vocnoise vociferously in favor of vocnoise uh vocnoise publicizing it and all that 
vocnoise i dont see vocnoise what they expect to gain vocnoise i mean if vocnoise 
they noise vocnoise they uh vocnoise in fact i dont cutoffssee vocnoise i dont think 
that they do gain anything by it iver it wasnt publicized to the vocnoise degree 
that it is now vocnoise it seems like anymore nothing is sacred i mean as 
far as papers are concerned vocnoise and uh vocnoise theres something else that i vocnoise 
i guess im old fashioned but i dont think vocnoise we need all this publicity 
about vocnoise all the sexual escapades of all the vocnoise people that are vocnoise errornotarinotarized 
or cutoffnonotorious vocnoise have errornotariousnotorious vocnoise lives vocnoise uh vocnoise i just vocnoise uh vocnoise 
i think maybe im old fashioned but i vocnoise and they vocnoise i can hardly 
vocnoise conceive vocnoise anyone being vocnoise a genuine homosexual vocnoise i mean evidently they are 
vocnoise um but uh vocnoise its so against human nature vocnoise i think vocnoise or 
against conventional human nature anyway iver well theres been quite a change in attitude of 
vocnoise the general public i errorthinikthink as far as errorwriwomenworking vocnoise work vocnoise women working 
away from home is concerned vocnoise and uh vocnoise i dont know vocnoise im glad 
that my wife vocnoise was able to work there at home vocnoise well vocnoise actually 
she worked in an office when our first boy vocnoise was just vocnoise small iver 
but uh vocnoise her mother vocnoise stayed with us for vocnoise several uh two or 
three years vocnoise and she was a baby sitter for our oldest boy iver and 
uh vocnoise she said well vocnoise mary would just well go out and get a 
job vocnoise she doesnt need to be vocnoise sit around here iver i mean that 
was vocnoise uh vocnoise and iver she was a vocnoise marys mother was a vocnoise 
kind of a vocnoise free thinking uh vocnoise uh vocnoise not a liberal but sil 
vocnoise uh vocnoise well vocnoise she went out vocnoise when she was in her early 
twenties vocnoise went out to cutoffnnorth vocnoise north d or uh vocnoise north or south 
dakota one or the other and homesteaded iver on a homestead iver and uh vocnoise 
then while she was out there vocnoise she met a vocnoise a cowboy who vocnoise 
was from also from ohio vocnoise and uh vocnoise they uh vocnoise they were married 
while they were out there i guess vocnoise but uh vocnoise she was vocnoise laugh 
vocnoise uh my son vocnoise used to say she was a piece of work she 
laugh she hadnt vocnoise definite ideas about cutoffeeverything vocnoise pretty near everything iver iver was 
it what iver oh iver sometimes vocnoise she and mary had more vocnoise disagreements than 
i ever had with her iver she would vocnoise pamper the kids vocnoise and vocnoise 
well vocnoise from where we lived there cutoffwwas vocnoise we lived just cutoffooff i dont 
know whether youre acquainted with the north end of columbus but anyway indianola avenue is 
one of the main thoroughfares vocnoise and uh vocnoise we lived about a vocnoise a 
block and a half off of indianola vocnoise and then just vocnoise another block vocnoise 
was a small shopping center vocnoise where there was a vocnoise drug store and a 
vocnoise cutoffsh barber shop and a vocnoise a ten cent store vocnoise theater vocnoise i 
forget a couple other shops vocnoise and um vocnoise when orrin was vocnoise about vocnoise 
i dont know cutoffssix vocnoise five five or cutoffssix vocnoise maybe six or seven years 
old vocnoise he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there 
vocnoise at all vocnoise so vocnoise one day vocnoise grandma gave him vocnoise i dont 
know a quarter or something vocnoise and that burned his pocket till vocnoise i dont 
know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or vocnoise whether he went up 
vocnoise on his own but he went up vocnoise to the store vocnoise and uh 
vocnoise i think vocnoise i dont know whether mary went up and got him or 
what anyway she found out he was up there vocnoise so cutoffanyhanyhow vocnoise when i 
came home she told me what had happened and i said well vocnoise that just 
cant be vocnoise so i took him downstairs and paddled him vocnoise and ive never 
been anything more said about it since then iver the only time i ever did 
iver paddle him but uh iver laugh iver well i vocnoise i told him vocnoise 
yknow i said vocnoise something we sil told you you are not to do iver 
and you went ahead and did it vocnoise so iver my parents homesteaded out there 
vocnoise in nineteen vocnoise eleven or twelve shortly after they were married iver they vocnoise 
theyd vocnoise go out there and there was um vocnoise i suppose it was a 
county seat town vocnoise and theyd file a claim on a certain area vocnoise of 
vocnoise land vocnoise uh vocnoise it was surveyed off and marked off vocnoise in sections 
a section of land vocnoise is uh vocnoise six hundred and forty acres vocnoise and 
that sounds like a lot of vocnoise it is a good sized area iver but 
laugh when you cant grow much of anything on it its iver not that valuable 
vocnoise but they cutoffththought sil thats what they thought though you vocnoise get it for 
free well you vocnoise and then you um vocnoise you prove up on it as 
they say you vocnoise you just vocnoise build buildings a house and barn and vocnoise 
and uh vocnoise so that you could vocnoise live on it vocnoise and uh vocnoise 
i think i dont know i suppose sil farm a certain amount of what i 
mean vocnoise put in wheat or whatever vocnoise and uh vocnoise and after five years 
you get a title to it its yours vocnoise so they thought well gee yknow 
free country free land vocnoise to a farmer vocnoise so uh vocnoise they went out 
there but vocnoise i sil dad said in vocnoise the eleven years that they were 
out there vocnoise they only raised vocnoise three or four crops iver i mean vocnoise 
its just too dry it cutoffwwasnt iver it wasnt really farming country vocnoise and he 
went vocnoise he went out there from iowa vocnoise where you vocnoise throw a kernel 
of corn out in the field and iver a stalk of corn would grow vocnoise 
but uh vocnoise thats how i vocnoise see uh vocnoise laugh the vocnoise only vocnoise 
regular crop they had when they were out there my parents vocnoise was kids laugh 
iver there were six of us born out there iver and uh vocnoise my oldest 
sister vocnoise started to school out there iver and vocnoise i dont know whether my 
cutoffssecond uh i dont think vocnoise my second sister ever went to school out there 
vocnoise but uh vocnoise things were so tough that vocnoise and mom had vocnoise taught 
school in iowa vocnoise where she grew up vocnoise and uh vocnoise got her teachers 
certificate vocnoise so vocnoise i guess she and dad agreed that if they could vocnoise 
find someone to stay with vocnoise us kids through the day she could teach iver 
so she did vocnoise i dont know whether it was vocnoise more than a year 
or vocnoise not vocnoise for vocnoise i think it was forty dollars a month vocnoise 
and uh vocnoise course that was forty dollars vocnoise more than they had otherwise vocnoise 
and uh vocnoise then i think vocnoise the vocnoise lets see she vocnoise noise vocnoise 
well she went out there when bernice was going to school vocnoise and bernice went 
to vocnoise my oldest sister went to vocnoise know whether its first or maybe second 
grade out there vocnoise says she vocnoise she really thought that mom was the best 
teacher she ever laughhadingradeschool vocnoise errorbuztbut uh vocnoise then vocnoise they hired a girl to 
come in as a hired girl vocnoise and uh vocnoise about the second or third 
day vocnoise she was there vocnoise she wasnt cutofffeelfeeling wasnt feeling very good iver vocnoise 
she had smallpox iver so uh vocnoise they got us kids vocnoise vaccinated in time 
but dad didnt i mean they iver didnt get vaccinated in time vocnoise and he 
was vocnoise just covered with vocnoise those sores for i dont know how long vocnoise 
uh vocnoise mom said that vocnoise after they started cutoffcu vocnoise after the scabs started 
falling off of him vocnoise why hed get out the bed and vocnoise shed take 
the sheet out in the yard and vocnoise shake it to get those scabs laughoff 
vocnoise but uh iver yeah iver the vocnoise the only uh vocnoise the vocnoise only 
people out there other than homesteaders were vocnoise sheepherders iver there was this vocnoise one 
guy vocnoise had a vocnoise so i dont know how many several herds of sheep 
vocnoise and hed hire vocnoise uh vocnoise i think they were mexicans iver as sheepherders 
vocnoise and uh vocnoise they were vocnoise not laughvery vocnoise desirable specimens other than for 
errorheatingherding vocnoise cutoffs herding sheep vocnoise and vocnoise wed come in vocnoise dirty when vocnoise 
mom was the uh vocnoise dirty as an old sheepherder laugh iver and then vocnoise 
back of our house vocnoise about vocnoise i dont know five hundred yards vocnoise theres 
a manmade vocnoise lake iver or a small one vocnoise and i dont know vocnoise 
whether it was there when we moved there or not vocnoise but anyway it was 
vocnoise fairly good size i mean vocnoise probably half mile a mile long and vocnoise 
and out in the middle of it vocnoise there was an island iver thered been 
a small vocnoise raised place out there vocnoise and uh vocnoise what i remember about 
it is vocnoise one morning vocnoise dad went out to milk and vocnoise the vocnoise 
milk cows were out on the on that island iver vocnoise so and vocnoise i 
dont know whether he had a boat or anyway theres a boat erroravailiableavailable to him 
and vocnoise and vocnoise he cutoffw vocnoise rowed across the island iver to milk the 
cows iver uh vocnoise and then uh vocnoise one day vocnoise my two sisters older 
than i bernice and francis vocnoise and i were outside playing and vocnoise bernice i 
dont know whether bernice or me but one of us said well cutofflelets vocnoise lets 
go down and wade in the lake iver and that was strictly no no iver 
well we started down there and vocnoise francis the goody two shoes said vocnoise im 
gonna tell mom iver vocnoise and she did but we were out iver bernice had 
hiked up her sil skirts and id rolled up my pants leg and vocnoise where 
i was probably not over knee deep vocnoise but uh vocnoise i think i was 
vocnoise good talking too was all we ever got out of it iver iver sil 
i was born in los angeles california vocnoise in the mid fifties vocnoise and when 
i was sil less then one year old sil my family moved to columbus sil

sil and sil moved back sil to sil columbus sil and sil did a variety 
of jobs sil in columbus sil um vocnoise sil then i went to ohio state 
university sil from nineteen eighty three sil to vocnoise sil ninety one vocnoise and got 
a masters degree in geology vocnoise sil vocnoise sil so im an alumnus laugh vocnoise 
sil and um sil vocnoise sil after that i sil had another sil variety of 
jobs sil um sil vocnoise sil but ive sil lived sil and hesand vocnoise sil 
well during that time i guess i lived in the university area sil for a 
number of years vocnoise i lived on sixteenth avenue vocnoise near the fairgrounds noise sil 
vocnoise noiseand um vocnoise lets see sil i sil exthad sil number of different jobs 
vocnoise sil currently i work sil at uh sil excludename in hilliard vocnoise and i 
live in worthington vocnoise sil uh vocnoise in the vocnoise sil south part of worthington 
im renting a room vocnoise sil from my mom vocnoise sil and im yes laugh 
vocnoise sil and i hesi sort of sil took a step backwards hesbut sil right 
now im saving up money and trying to buy a house somewhere vocnoise sil its 
sil something im sort of kicking myself sil wishing i would have done vocnoise noise 
sil about sil twenty or thirty years ago cause it would have been a lot 
cheaper laugh vocnoise right right it wasnt a top noisepriority for me then laugh vocnoise 
sil yeah iver one vocnoise iver yeah laugh vocnoise i dont really have any sil 
childhood recollections of california sil yeah vocnoise laugh iver noise umhum umhum noise right vocnoise 
well and im right now im vocnoise forty sil five years old so ive lived 
vocnoise sil in or around sil columbus sil for most of forty four years sil 
excluding times when i was away at school vocnoise sil iver northern ohio vocnoise sil 
its sil near elyria sil which is west of cleveland sil noise sil iver yes 
sil umhum iver right sil right sil umhum sil vocnoise i studied there i studied

there vocnoise not doing really at the same time iver studying music for a while 
and then studying chemistry laugh vocnoise yeah sil no i noise i cutoffclippingcouldnt i didnt 
think of any projects where i could use both laugh iver umhum iver well vocnoise 
thats sil interesting sil thing hesim sil im not sil in geology laughright laughnow laugh 
vocnoise i sil um sil vocnoise sil im actually making more money right now in 
sil music than i am in geology vocnoise sil but im making most my money 
in something thats irrelevant to sil most my vocnoise that has nothing to do with 
any of noisestudies vocnoise sil um sil yes i sil play sil um principle horn 
in the excludename hessymphony uh symphony orchestra sil and um vocnoise sil vocnoise sil last 
year i was in a professional singing group vocnoise but im also in a number 
of volunteer sil choirs sil um sil the sil choir at the first unitarian universalist 
church sil in sil excludename vocnoise sil and um sil a small sil choir where 
i work sil which i got the opportunity to conduct today sil laughyes the conductor 
sil was sil the conductor was sil um sil not at work sil so sil 
um vocnoise sil i sil hesi do a lot of music my sil spare time 
vocnoise sil mostly vocnoise sil uh vocnoise sil but uh vocnoise sil unfortunately i didnt 
sil get a sil job in geology sil and i sil i dont have a 
sil sil full time job music sil either vocnoise sil either one of those would 
be nice but i sil laugh vocnoise iver noiseactually sil um vocnoise i went back 
sil i came back to ohio state sil um sil in vocnoise see vocnoise sil 
hesninety sil cutoffffour sil hesthree sil through ninety extfive sil and got a sil teaching 
certificate in sil for secondary science vocnoise sil and i taught sil vocnoise for a 
year sil a vocnoise at a small school in lancaster sil catholic sil excludename high 
school sil down there vocnoise sil and um vocnoise sil vocnoise sil left there sil 
uh vocnoise sil part of was my fault i sil wasnt very good at discipline 
sil in the classroom sil vocnoise sil so that was probably one of the biggest 
problems i had sil vocnoise but uh sil iver noiseno no in fact the noise 
principal when she interviewed me sil asked me that vocnoise sil and i noisesaid noise 
when were raised sil in the unitarian sunday school vocnoise sil its a sil its 
sil almost an indoctrination in tolerance sil laughforotherreligions laugh so youre better off with me 
then somebody that believes noisetheirs is the only one true religion iver noise yes laugh 
vocnoise but it was interesting um um sil they did have vocnoise sil uh sil 
assemblies sil where sil they had religious assemblies um religion wasnt a sil all sil 
uh sil it sil wasnt sil all invasive in this school but vocnoise they did 
have assemblies and sil uh sil for religious holidays and that kind of thing vocnoise 
sil and sil i remember sil thinking vocnoise sil sil uh vocnoise sil its sil 
its interesting vocnoise sil that sil the sil concept of sil eating vocnoise sil somebodys 
flesh blood sil laugh its almost sil cult like laugh and im noisethinking and im 
starting to think sil well what really separates a sil a religion from a cult 
vocnoise laugh and hesnow i think its just hesthe sil this social acceptance of it 
really almost vocnoise sil um sil hespeople sil you know how many people are in 
it sil noiseprobably sil hesi what number sil noise divides them im not really laughsure 
laugh vocnoise sil yeah sil yeah vocnoise sil yeah sil well i heslike i like 
sil um sil i sil sil was sil ive been very sil politically active at 
various times my past sil and um sil vocnoise sil especially i guess in the 
sil vocnoise late seventies and early eighties sil i was sil very active in um 
vocnoise alternative extenergy sil fighting against nuclear power sil and um vocnoise been active in 
various times in animal rights sil movements sil and uh sil political sil campaigns vocnoise 
sil uh sil foreign policy kinds of debates sil vocnoise sil that kind of sil 
kind of sil thing vocnoise noise sil and vocnoise noise one thing that ive noticed 
hesa a lot sil is sil vocnoise noise sil there are a lot of noise 
vocnoise noise sil there are well there sil wide spectrum but sil vocnoise sil in 
the sil um vocnoise sil there a lot of liberals noise in the catholic church 
too vocnoise laugh sil you know hesthat iver for example one of the sil vocnoise 
sil noiseissues that they were in the fore front on was sil uh hesjustice sil 
justice for sil um sil vocnoise sil people in central and latin america sil yeah 
noise laugh noise vocnoise umhum noise iver noise noiseyeah noise noiseyeah sil arch bishop romaro 
sil yeah in el salvador sil thats noiseright sil vocnoise sil umhum noise sil noise 
sil umhum vocnoise thats right sil thats right sil vocnoise sil yes noise sil so 
sil vocnoise there sil are sil there are sil conservative and vocnoise sil progressive wings 
for sil in every religion im sure vocnoise laugh vocnoise sil vocnoise even probably unitarian 
universalist laugh although vocnoise um sil ive heard that they conservative sil unitarian churches are 
in new england around boston vocnoise sil where it was started and there are some 
that are relatively sil conservative there vocnoise sil but um vocnoise sil for the most 
part its sil its what you would call liberal religion vocnoise sil yeah vocnoise sil 
laugh vocnoise sil are ya iver great laugh sil where you from vocnoise noise iver 
oh okay sil noise sil okay noise sil noiseumhum noise noise sil umhum sil umhum 
sil sil vocnoise laugh vocnoise noise sil my brother my older brother lived in bloomington 
for a while vocnoise sil and sil vocnoise he ran a sil music store sil 
on the hessquare sil square in the center of town sil vocnoise sil might have 
just been called noisebloomington music im not sure sil sold guitars and vocnoise laughthings laugh 
vocnoise sil square right across from the court house extyeah sil yeah noise iver i 
think it was the east side sil noise sil i think sil laugh vocnoise its 
sil um noise it was while ago heshes hasnt been there for a while noise 
sil yeah laugh sil noise vocnoise sil uhhuh iver vocnoise noise right sil right it 
probably went out of business when he left vocnoise iver umhum iver noise umhum iver 
noise uhhuh noise iver noise sil umhum noise sil umhum noise sil noise sil noise 
sil right noise iver noise iver noise iver laugh sil uhhuh noise uhhuh noise vocnoise 
sil what instrument do you play iver noiseumhum noise iver noise laugh noise iver noise 
iver noise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver noise iver uhhum iver uhhum iver noise sil 
laugh sil hesive sil hesi sil play the french horn noise vocnoise sil i dont 
think i said that before vocnoise sil and sil i sing sil tenor sil and 
sil mostly sil choir stuff but sil ive done a sil few sil small solo 
sil things sil noise sil uh hum vocnoise iver noise iver noise iver well vocnoise 
noisethats what everybody when i tell noisepeople i play noise thats what everybody says but 
sil it seems to me that any instrument vocnoise laughcanbehard laugh depending i mean i 
cant see how anybody can sil play a clarinet for example laugh but sil there 
noise sil some things that are hard about sil playing the sil french horn sil 
vocnoise sil vocnoise one is that you can play sil many different notes with a 
single sil fingering sil iver noise and vocnoise sil you just sil its sil ear 
related sil being able to sil play is sil related to how well sil how 
well you can hear noise vocnoise sil and sil how well you can project sil 
what sil what you want to hear into sil how you form your mouth and 
noise what comes out sil laugh iver right right its not an analytical process sil 
its analytical in the vocnoise sense of vocnoise controlling your mouth noise and vocnoise sil 
and sil your hand in the bell and that kind of thing vocnoise to sil 
vocnoise get what you want to come out sil but vocnoise sil its not erroranalyticanalytical 
analytical in terms of finger combinations no laugh not so much vocnoise iver vocnoise right 
sil its bad sil laughitsbad laugh on the other hand its not good to sil 
let your mind wander off laughsomewhere laugh hesi sil hesi find myself having to focus 
sometimes laugh vocnoise and to really sil noise uhhum sil noise vocnoise vocnoise iver yeah 
when i first went to oberlin i was a sil performance major sil in french 
horn vocnoise sil and looking back on it i wish id sil maybe sil thought 
to sil major in music education or at least have a little bit of vocnoise 
sil background in that sil because vocnoise sil im sil vocnoise hesthinking vocnoise it would 
have given me a little more sil dimension in terms of my noise vocnoise sil 
my sil teaching sil possibilities sil vocnoise sil and vocnoise sil although im sil certified 
to teach now in sil chemistry and sil uh earth science vocnoise sil um vocnoise 
sil it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also sil vocnoise 
iver i could i could sil it might take me hesa sil uh sil cutoffs 
a year or two iver just for the sil courses that i need laugh iver 
sil yeah it is it is vocnoise and theres nothing to guarantee that i wouldnt 
have the same result laugh which isnt to say that someday i wont get sil 
back into teaching sil but um sil vocnoise sil i might sil uh sil iver 
sil noise well its harder than sil i think in vocnoise some ways than people 
think sil um vocnoise sil i went to the teach ohio fair last year sil 
to look around sil vocnoise sil and hesdidnt sil didnt see that much interest hesin 
sil in uh sil chemistry or general science teachers sil vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise 
sil i think the market has sil is fluctuated back to a point where they 
dont need as many noiserightnow noise laugh sil vocnoise theyre not clamoring for us laugh 
vocnoise umhum iver uh noisehum noise umhum vocnoise noise iver yeah vocnoise i just renewed 
my hescertification certificate last year so i laughmaygetbackintoit vocnoise part of the reason i renewed 
my certificate was vocnoise sil i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools 
last year sil and sil thats kind of like a tutoring job where you can 
go vocnoise sil you can arrange exthours sil with a student sil that sil is 
at home for some reason noise vocnoise sil um sil i had one that sil 
just had a baby laugh noise sil and um sil vocnoise they sil its an 
interesting job because they look for somebody that sil can cover sil the most technical 
i guess subject that the student is taking vocnoise sil in my case it sil 
turned out to be sil chemistry in one sil i think sil chemistry once and 
i sil it was the sil algebra sil two vocnoise another vocnoisetime vocnoise sil vocnoise 
noise but sil vocnoise sil they expected us to sil at least expected me vocnoise 
uh to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit 
of time on them vocnoise so there was english and there was history laugh so 
really requires you to be well rounded laugh and i sil i like kind of 
like extthat um vocnoise ive taught sil in a couple of other places um sil 
community sil colleges vocnoise sil the excludename college in newark sil i taught a chemistry 
class there vocnoise sil and sil the excludename sil excludename sil community college sil which 
is sil in hillsboro but i taught at their excludename branch vocnoise sil and i 
taught a sil hesintroduction an introduction to ecology class noisethere vocnoise sil an introduction sil 
to sil uh sil introduction to the arts it was called laugh vocnoise and that 
was interesting it was noise sil unknown those are noise vocnoise its kind of an 
underclass of teachers they dont pay noise sil noise sil noise you enough to do 
that sil noise they sil pay you sil vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil per sil 
noise student contact hour vocnoise and noise sil vocnoise in my chemistry class i was 
vocnoise sil teaching i think vocnoise a total of five or six contact hours a 
week vocnoise sil and they were sil paying something like sil twenty one or sil 
twenty sil two dollars an hour laugh noiseso vocnoise iver yeah they dont pay you 
for any of that laughstuff laugh iver sil no sil no they didnt vocnoise sil 
um didnt pay for grading or sil preparing your classes or vocnoise sil or researching 
noiseanything laugh so sil right unknown but but still even though sil it was real 
vocnoise sil very much underpaid job i sil i liked it sil when i did 
it vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise sil i liked the introduction to the arts class 
because i had to sil develop my own curriculum for it laugh laughright they had 
a sil when they told me i sil i sil they would hire me to 
teach this class they gave me a book vocnoise sil that was about this thick 
and it was only about sil noisepainting vocnoise iver and i looked at it i 
thought sil noise sil vocnoise sil introduction to the arts to me means something a 
lot broader laughthanthat so noise sil vocnoise i ended up coming up with a class 
that was vocnoise sil it was an sil only nine weeks too it was only 
nine classes um so was noise about a sil two and a half or three 
hour class each week for nine weeks vocnoise sil and uh vocnoise i ended up 
coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting 
sil mostly sil uh sil visual art vocnoise sil and for the second three weeks 
we talked about music sil and the sil uh sil development of music sil various 
aspects vocnoise and for the last three weeks we talked about sil theater vocnoise actually 
for the sil two of the last three weeks we talked about theater sil and 
for the last week we talked about musical theater and opera laugh so vocnoise for 
a lot of these kids you know from excludename it was an introduction sil to 
sil uh sil it was an introduction to sil a lot of noisethings they may 
sil might not have been exposed to sil laugh vocnoise yeah iver noise yeah i 
think sil mostly they did sil uh vocnoise sil i was kind of surprised sil 
uh sil which sil class was this in i think this was in that introduction 
to the arts class vocnoise sil i was kind of surprised noise that one of 
the students in sil class sil thought it was sil very hard sil laugh sil 
i didnt think it was that hard at all but vocnoise sil she sil wrote 
me some kind of nasty note noise sil noise sil noise sil at the last 
class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at this 
school vocnoise sil before that my class and i was giving her a b and 
she was her average was going to be ruined and she hoped i felt guilty 
about it laugh not really laugh not really vocnoise i mean i was grading on 
a pretty much of a noisecurve too i mean vocnoise sil i was trying really 
not to flunk anybody that was sil that was sil attempting to do the work 
vocnoise sil uh i think i flunked one person that was really goofing off vocnoise 
noise sil and uh noise vocnoise but in terms of a curve i had as 
i had bs i had a few noisecs laugh noise yeah vocnoise so sil yep 
vocnoise oh well laugh vocnoise iver yeah yeah vocnoise sil it might be noise sil 
umhum umhum sil iver umhum sil noise right sil right vocnoise sil and sil and 
it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to cutoffs tell a teacher vocnoise 
im noisesupposed to get an a sil whats wrong with you laugh whats wrong with 
you vocnoise vocnoise i mean to me youre supposed to earn your grade laugh iver 
noise its always been my feeling and vocnoise and uh vocnoise i try to be 
fair in the way i grade vocnoise uh vocnoise you know its i try to 
be as objective as i can vocnoise sometimes i vocnoise because i think its important 
that people learn how to write vocnoise i would ask all my classes to write 
sil an essay or sil short iver short uh sil essay for for a test 
vocnoise and um vocnoise but the way that i would grade those would be sil 
pretty noisescientific i noisethink vocnoise you know id come up with a rubric and i 
noisewould say vocnoise you you need to have sil you need to mention certain things 
noiseand ill give certain noisepoints noisefor your noisementioning noisecertain vocnoise things laugh vocnoise yeah vocnoise 
ive ive never been a sil noiseive noisenever vocnoise been a teacher where whose had 
to assign or grade noisecreative writing noise vocnoise laugh laughimnotsureiwouldknowhowtodothat yeah laugh iver right vocnoise 
right laugh iver umhum iver laughright laugh iver right iver right iver right vocnoise well 
noise when i was teaching vocnoise taking teacher vocnoise noiseeducation classes here vocnoise um vocnoise 
and noiseobserving noise classroom teachers vocnoise um vocnoise they vocnoise would always tell me vocnoise 
you noise need to give a grade for class noiseparticipation iver that was always too 
subjective for noiseme vocnoise i iver i could not sil see myself vocnoise doing that 
and sil and you know iver sil vocnoise how am i going to tell whos 
vocnoise yknow trying to butter me up noise by vocnoise raising their hand and vocnoise 
and asking questions sil um vocnoise iver i uh yknow i could i just couldnt 
see doing noisethat and i was vocnoise i had enough to worry about and think 
about sil when i was trying to teach in laughclass vocnoise keep everything else straight 
sil and also mark down if people are participating uh that was tough vocnoise i 
ended up not doing it laugh iver umhum iver subjective right iver right iver bump 
iver i know iver i know i know well its good to have that i 
think it would be good to have that leeway laugh vocnoise but im not sure 
i would trust myself because vocnoise there there were definitely times when i was teaching 
when i would have noisemore of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others 
vocnoise and i wanted to be fair vocnoise in terms of vocnoise um sil not 
cutting down the ones vocnoise i sil didnt like that much laugh yeah vocnoise yeah 
vocnoise iver umhum sil umhum iver vocnoise iver right iver right iver right iver right 
vocnoise i think teaching band might be fun because vocnoise i think you vocnoise only 
ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with 
whether you were there laugh vocnoise whether you sil were sil well behaved yeah and 
whether youre trying to play your instrument laugh i i dont think we ever got 
as bs and cs laugh vocnoise yeah iver umhum iver right sil the competition noiseaspect 
laugh iver laugh you played saxophone in the band vocnoise iver noise sil umhum sil 
yeah iver do you have one now iver uhhuh iver oh thats good sil thats 
good iver well i can tell you some community bands that could use you laugh 
yeah yeah iver well vocnoise um vocnoise the one sil thats vocnoise um sil god 
iver shawns in yeah vocnoise uh huh vocnoise um vocnoise uh we dont have enough 
saxophones vocnoise sure we could use you laugh iver huh vocnoise oh well iver were 
having like three concerts the next month laugh iver right right laugh vocnoise right iver 
right iver vocnoise umhum vocnoise umhum vocnoise i i like playing that band vocnoise mostly 
because vocnoise the director is excludename vocnoise hes a his dad is teaches trumpet here 
at ohio state vocnoise and he is uh vocnoise he likes to challenge us vocnoise 
uh vocnoise and its not so much in the summer in the summer vocnoise we 
end up playing marches and vocnoise stuff that sil popular favorites iver right vocnoise right 
but during the rest of the year a lot of times noisewell vocnoise noiseplay sil 
really noise really um vocnoise challenging and interesting band music vocnoise and you dont always 
get the opportunity to do that vocnoise in uh vocnoise musical groups vocnoise yeah vocnoise 
sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator of vocnoise what they 
vocnoise expect the audience to want to hear laugh iver sil well vocnoise i play 
actually in two orchestras vocnoise and uh vocnoise excludename symphony vocnoise and in the excludename 
orchestra vocnoise which is an all sil amateur group vocnoise but uh vocnoise its sil 
its actually vocnoise there were noisetimes uh when i was vocnoise ive been in that 
group for sil maybe seven or eight years now vocnoise there have been times when 
ive been in noisethat group that have vocnoise i have vocnoise thought sil it had 
a really wretched sound laugh because they dont have auditions they just take anybody that 
wants to play vocnoise and if you take a vocnoise string player that cant play 
in tune it can really wreck everything vocnoise laugh vocnoise yeah vocnoise but uh i 
think weve improved a lot uh we we gave a concert vocnoise uh vocnoise a 
couple weeks ago vocnoise at a church in upper arlington vocnoise and uh vocnoise i 
thought it went pretty well vocnoise one piece a little bit of mozart vocnoise uh 
vocnoise some concertos sil so vocnoise that was fun laugh yeah iver well vocnoise it 
depends vocnoise i think vocnoise id like to do new stuff vocnoise but sometimes i 
also like to do the old favorites vocnoise um vocnoise in the vocnoise excludename symphony 
vocnoise um vocnoise unfortunately they tend to have budget problems sil um sil because a 
lot of the people in that group are paid vocnoise um vocnoise noise umhum noise 
i get noise i get sil cutoffs paid its kind of semi professional sil cutoffaesaspect 
sil aspect thing where you vocnoise get paid per service vocnoise but um vocnoise lets 
see vocnoise so they have to uh balance the number of rehearsals they can pay 
people for vocnoise with the amount of music that sil they want to do laugh 
and uh vocnoise this last year we played a sil movement of the shuman concert 
piece for four horns and orchestra vocnoise and i was a little bit sil flabbergasted 
when i saw that on the schedule vocnoise at the beginning of the year because 
noise its sil really noisehard to play vocnoise and i thought vocnoise is he expecting 
sil us to play this the solos vocnoise or is he expecting to bring in 
somebody laugh iver well as it turned out he expected sil us to play the 
solos laugh or sil didnt play the whole piece we only played one movement of 
it vocnoise and um vocnoise i thought it came out pretty well i have a 
sil recording of it vocnoise for a while there i was worried that we didnt 
get a recording of it and i was sil really upset sil laugh iver yeah 
vocnoise just one concert iver i know iver i know thats why you have to 
get it recorded laugh sil noiseit vocnoise it would be nice to have more than 
one concert sil but uh noise vocnoise they sil they just sil theyre on a 
shoestring vocnoise they really are vocnoise they get most of their money i think by 
noise well vocnoise noiseprobably if you count sil in kind contribution vocnoise the sil cutoffwehsterwesterville 
uh otterbein college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space vocnoise and sil uh 
sil sil salary the conductor vocnoise uh vocnoise so thats a sil huge an amount 
of noise money vocnoise they put into it vocnoise vocnoise what we have to vocnoise 
give noisethem in return is sil noise an opportunity for vocnoise noisepeople to play noisein 
noiseorchestra vocnoise so uh sometimes we have cutoffstuwstudents noise college students play in the orchestra 
vocnoise especially string players because they noisedont have a vocnoise college orchestra vocnoise uh but 
once in a while well get wind players play in it sil also vocnoise and 
um vocnoise sometimes noiseit leads to a little bit of friction vocnoise when vocnoise they 
get to play something you wanted to play laugh iver but vocnoise most the time 
its not its not bad vocnoise um vocnoise so theres theres that its an noise 
opportunity for vocnoise the vocnoise musicians in the college to play in an orchestra vocnoise 
and vocnoise and what else do they get out of it vocnoise i dont know 
prestige a suppose laugh yeah iver they iver dont get cutoffffederal i dont think they 
get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council 
vocnoise and they vocnoise they raise money from the businesses noisein the community vocnoise noiseplus 
vocnoise we charge for tickets laugh for people to come and see us vocnoise and 
sometimes its noise sometimes we get a lot vocnoise sometimes we dont get so many 
vocnoise turns out the concerts we get the most vocnoise the biggest audience for vocnoise 
are the vocnoise christmas concerts where we have childrens noisechoir laugh because iver yes yeah 
laugh laughthats right vocnoise you cant get a noiseseat there laugh so its a good 
money maker iver uh noisethats right well we they dont they dont they dont give 
them noise uh noise i dont know maybe they give each extone one free ticket 
or something laugh laughtherestofthemhavetopay laugh iver yeah sil yeah iver umhum vocnoise umhum sil yeah 
vocnoise but that those are those tend to be my least favorite concerts although vocnoise 
our conductor tries hard to vocnoise make it interesting for orchestra members sil by bringing 
in some noise sil music but its sil thats sil interesting noise challenging or whatever 
for orchestra vocnoise hes um vocnoise cutoffeh were lucky to have him hes excludename vocnoise 
excludename whos a vocnoise associate conductor for the uh vocnoise columbus symphony noise umhum vocnoise 
umhum vocnoise hes vocnoise hes very good vocnoise i sil im glad that we have 
him as a conductor noise i was in the orchestra when we vocnoise selected vocnoise 
him vocnoise we auditioned noise think five vocnoise four or five conductors over the course 
of the year we had sil each one for a different concert noise and we 
noiseended up picking him vocnoise laugh yeah iver they werent all they noisewerent all columbus 
noisepeople some of them sort of sil flew in vocnoise visited laugh for noise for 
the job vocnoise noiseyeah vocnoise noisethere is a noiselittle bit of prestige vocnoise um vocnoise 
excludename was vocnoise won some competition a couple years ago about vocnoise uh vocnoise upcoming 
noiseconducters iver in the sil noiseand the u noises iver right vocnoise thats true iver 
noisethats true iver umhum iver right iver thats true vocnoise sometimes we vocnoise have trouble 
finding enough vocnoise violists vocnoise or something yknow an instrument like that vocnoise um vocnoise 
but they vocnoise they sil usually get enough to play a concert sil sometimes we 
sil have to bring in vocnoise a couple of vocnoise instrumentalists sil for the last 
few rehearsals vocnoise umhum noise so we sort of have vocnoise stringers noise i guess 
youd laughcallthem laugh yeah vocnoise weve actually been on w o s u also vocnoise 
uh radio on music noise um vocnoise our extrecording last year yeah vocnoise of beethovens 
ninth vocnoise got on music in midohio laugh yeah noise we used the noiseotterbein college 
choir noise noiseumhum iver it is it noiseis laugh umhum vocnoise umhum vocnoise umhum noise 
there noise there there noisewere some noisefun things noisein noisethat vocnoise noiseyeah noise ah noise 
noisesydney opera noisehouse i have a picture noiseof that in my head noise with the 
big noiseshells the noisebig noise its a neat noiseplace iver noisebad acoustics really iver shocking 
iver umhum iver oh my iver umhum iver umhum laugh well vocnoise speaking of acoustics 
vocnoise i i dont know noiseif im unknown youll have to tell me if im 
going off the subject laugh or yknow if you need to ask me something else 
sil noiseokay vocnoise um vocnoise this is another interesting story vocnoise my vocnoise church vocnoise 
choir vocnoise is very important noisepart of the noisechurch up there on excludename have you 
ever been to the church up there noise should vocnoise visit sometime although vocnoise youre 
only noisegoing to be here for another month vocnoise summer is not necessarily the best 
time to visit iver noiseyeah noise but um vocnoise just to see the church vocnoise 
might be fun vocnoise um vocnoise we vocnoise about vocnoise how many years ago seven 
or eight years ago decided to build vocnoise a new vocnoise worship center building vocnoise 
and because we were really sil too sil too big vocnoise for the noise sanctuary 
that we had iver and um vocnoise so basically they decided to build a new 
building vocnoise adjacent to vocnoise the church vocnoise tacked on sil and vocnoise we vocnoise 
they asked the choir vocnoise for input iver as to what the sanctuary should be 
noiselike laugh so noisewe had a tour vocnoise uh the choir took a tour our 
choir director vocnoise um vocnoise arranged it vocnoise to about six five or six churches 
in the columbus area vocnoise to noisesing in them vocnoise noiseand vocnoise not noise for 
an audience but just to sing noise and to see which ones noisewe liked the 
noiseacoustics of vocnoise and uh vocnoise that was noise interesting we sang vocnoise in uh 
vocnoise we sang in noisecentral noisepresbyterian noisechurch downtown vocnoise which was noisewhere this vocnoise my 
one of my orchestras plays a lot vocnoise and uh vocnoise we sang in other 
different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we didnt laugh 
maybe it had some feedback i think the noisenew noisebuilding noiseis acoustically very good vocnoise 
its noisecertainly vocnoise much noisebetter than vocnoise old vocnoise worship center because vocnoise i dont 
noise know if youve seen a picture or anything of the church vocnoise the old 
worship center vocnoise was designed by a modern architect to be a modern vocnoise quote 
unquote type building in nineteen noisesixtytwo vocnoise and vocnoise its laughyeah laugh noiseits noise its 
vocnoise flat noise noisetheres a noiseflat noise noiseroof vocnoise with a sil clear story vocnoise 
in the middle noise it has noisenothing in noisejust noise its just empty noisespace vocnoise 
over the vocnoise over the worship center vocnoise noiseso noise when you would sing in 
that as a choir you spread out along the front vocnoise if you were under 
the vocnoise high cutoffs sil place sil your noisevoice noisewould go unknown noise all noiseof 
noisethe way to noisethe noiseback vocnoise but if you were noiseunder this flat ceiling thats 
only about vocnoise seven or vocnoise thats only about nine or ten feet high vocnoise 
noise noiseit was noisedeado noise it was noisejust noisemuffled laugh and um vocnoise it was 
noiseterrible noiseacoustically laugh noisebut noise yknow we made do noisewith noiseit vocnoise for many years 
vocnoise and then um noise and then noise we had the vocnoise the noisechance to 
get this input into this new noisebuilding and its vocnoise its uh vocnoise its really 
beautiful its a circular vocnoise almost circular big vocnoise uh noise space with a noise 
noisehigh point in the noisemiddle of the roof vocnoise and uh vocnoise its its noisenice 
laugh noisewell you could still go its they wont have they wont noisehave a lot 
of um iver music noise during the summer but theyll have vocnoise regular worship service 
noise i think theyre at ten noisethirty noisenow vocnoise on noisesunday noisemornings vocnoise i noisehad 
lot of times skip noisemost vocnoise during the summer laugh iver noise iver umhum noise 
umhum noise umhum iver umhum iver right iver right vocnoise but how old is your 
noisekid iver you could vocnoise but you could take her to iver oh okay vocnoise 
well the reason i asked was a lot it noiseseems to me a lot of 
noisethe impetus for going to noisechurch or going back to church for people vocnoise is 
when their kid gets old enough to vocnoise go to sunday school laugh starting noiseasking 
questions about religion and youre saying vocnoise well i suppose i could answer all of 
these but laugh yeah iver right iver you go to laughright laughright vocnoise right noise 
noisewell i started going to cutoffchahchurch sunday school when i was vocnoise five or six 
years old iver vocnoise noiseumhum noise i i was raised in the sunday school of 
this church up here vocnoise yeah noise yes um a long time member vocnoise in 
fact vocnoise i think i may be vocnoise about the longest term member of the 
noisechoir vocnoise right now yeah vocnoise noisebecause i sang in the noisechoir there when i 
was in high school vocnoise back in nineteen seventy laugh laughso vocnoise thats thirty years 
ago laugh yeah vocnoise yep vocnoise noiseumhum noise right vocnoise right vocnoise right vocnoise noiseits 
it noisemay noiseme getting a little noisebit more common nowadays but vocnoise its still i 
noisethink noise the church gets most of its members from noise as converts laugh noiseand 
vocnoise recovering right vocnoise recovering you name it laugh yeah iver umhum vocnoise noiseumhum vocnoise 
wow vocnoise uh huh vocnoise umhum vocnoise well i have vocnoise i have two noiseuncles

sil you couldnt win here because he had too many slow white guys so iver 
and that was pretty dumb but iver sil umhum iver vocnoise well cutoffiim sil im

umhum iver umhum sil yeah sil they you you love to hate him or love 
him one the other i cutoffahad i think hes a great coach uh sil i 
think he does some stupid things but we all do yknow iver umhum iver umhum

iver umhum sil yeah and they just beat indiana in basketball unknown iver saturday i 
think it was iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum sil yeah sil vocnoise iver well 
they had a heck of a time beating cincinnati sil which they probably shouldve killed 
sil and then o u had a heck of a time beating them yknow iver 
umhum iver umhum sil umhum vocnoise yeah and thats the where you vocnoise thats way 
you really you should be i mean uh noise you got to be ready for 
tournament time yknow sil i dont know if this thing moved or what vocnoise sil 
vocnoise sil vocnoise iver noise iver yeah cutoffbbaseball uh sil i like baseball sil i 
useta like that a lot better when i was younger but sil now i dont 
i wouldnt take the time to cutoffwwatch sil sit and watch a whole baseball game 
on the tv yknow the reds and indians iver umhum vocnoise the reds uh sil 
more so than the indians back sil my younger days because they werent worth a 
damn but iver umhum iver umhum iver vocnoise sil i sil not really a big 
fan uh sil i think one of the big problems is gonna be uh sil 
uh initially just the uh sil uh the monetary thing of it yknow the people 
that supported the uh vocnoise basically supported the uh sil uh minor league teams that 
they had here yknow uh were like blue collar people and that sil you go 
for twenty thirty bucks and sil have a good time get drunk throw beer and 
sil and up there yknow youre not gonna be able to do that its gonna 
cost you uh sil a minimum of fifty to a hundred dollars probably take a 
family there sil couple of kids or something like that yknow iver vocnoise well the 
minor league hockey team the columbus chill are never there sil umhum sil they dont 
have it now but uh because the blue jackets came in but vocnoise but sil 
i think itd be good if it goes but sil im just not sure that 
sil columbus is gonna support something like that sil and its basically ohio state yknow 
sil and they dont even support the uh sil hockey team we got errorfrafor ohio 
state yknow sil and yet theyre good iver umhum iver umhum iver vocnoise well the 
uh wolff family and uh sil the mcconnells have been around forever yknow sil uh 
worthington industries and sil and the wolff familys columbus dispatch uh sil uh then you 
got uh i think its rozutti sil uh hes like a sil was a construction 
guy so uh vocnoise uh sil theyve been around forever and everything and uh sil 
they sil can get their ways through uh sil political arenas and everything cutoffeelse but 
i think most the money was uh sil was private money sil but they were 
given like tax incentives and unknownstuff things of that nature iver the old cutoffpenpenitentiary iver 
umhum sil yeah its an cutoffoold it was an old eyesore that they should have 
got rid of years ago but iver umhum iver well i think they tried to 
get some kind of a deal with uh sil when they were planning this thing 
and with uh sil with ohio state to sil uh sil yknow like have the 
schottenstein center down at uh sil down closer to downtown or sil or something like 
that sil and play half your ball games there or something like that but sil 
but ohio state dont need that yknow they got their own stuff sil so iver 
umhum iver umhum iver yeah iver well that basically is cutoffevevery yknow as your sil 
influx of sil people move outer sil city limits and everything yknow then uh sil 
yknow you got to have places for them to shop and everything and sil basically 
the northland malls been there forever jacob who owned indians sil owned it sil uh 
sil and he never did anything to it yknow so vocnoise you got cutoffyyour over 
at your lazarus or penneys and sil uh sil mainstay sil places that sil generally 
move there because of the uh sil years ago because it was sil something well 
it was right there with cutoffwi with a lot of people population and everything sil 
and then cutofflilike sil like i say if you yknow you got sil basically the 
people moving sil out sil to get away from the sil the traffic and all 
that stuff yknow sil not that theyre moving away from it theyre still getting into 
it but sil uh the district perspective on it sil uh sil then you vocnoise 
cutoffhaftahave cutoffbbuild if you build it they will come they say yknow so sil umhum 
sil umhum sil and i guess hes still gonna build it so iver uhuh iver 
as it was jacobs sold the northland mall anyway so its probably gonna be sil 
like a sil cutoffshshopping sil a strip mall more or less iver umhum iver yeah 
sil which is good for me because i dont ever go there anyway so iver 
and im one of those go in get what you want and get the heck 
out yknow and iver umhum sil i remember when i was married my my ex 
said do you want go uh sil shopping sil what iver just get me a 
couple shirts or something yknow she always bought my clothes anyway so sil so just 
get me a couple cutoffshshirts get me whatever you think i need yknow sil ill 
be here sil drinking beer watching sil sports sil yknow iver its uh iver i 
live at um one sixty one and cleveland area sil in an apartment up there 
iver it aint that far its uh iver if you got a car its easy 
to get there sil yeah but sil if you if youre sil ride the bus 
its sometimes uh sil takes a couple hours so iver umhum iver umhum iver yeah 
iver vocnoise iver sil id like to seen it pass just for the fact to 
see what the hell they would have done with the money but sil uh sil 
i dont blame people for voting for the one and not vote for the other 
sil because youre talking about something twenty years vocnoise i had a engineering sil a 
civil engineering friend years ago and uh sil i was a unknown cutoffwoworked worked at 
ashland chemical which is over in dublin and i lived over where im living now 
sil and every sil year they were doing work on two seventy yknow sil so 
i get pissed off and uh bitch sil be bitching at him about it and 
everything yknow and hed go sil you dont realize yknow by time we get something 
approved sil through all the sil parameters youve got to go through and everything sil 
and then they start working on it and then they get it done sil its 
already ten fifteen years old iver guess i never thought about it sil like that 
unknown iver umhum iver umhum iver yeah iver umhum sil yeah cutoffggoodale thats sil im 
surprised theyre not getting a lot of heat from that but sil because that parks 
been there forever yknow iver umhum iver umhum sil yeah sil plus they have that 
uh sil which theyve had for like twenty some years a comfest or something sil 
uh which is sil big thing down there yknow sil uh sil local musicians and 
iver umhum iver umhum iver yeah but the ones that they really needed to do 
sil like two cutoffsevseventy well like seventy one and seventy i mean that sil i 
dont sil its a bottle neck area yknow sil and they really should have done 
something with that sil twenty years ago yknow iver um thats probably when they started 
yeah sil umhum iver vocnoise vocnoise i used to when i was driving now uh 
sil vocnoise sil cutoffpluplus sil especially when i was going through the uh vocnoise going 
to two seventy things yknow i had people flip me off and stuff like that 
and vocnoise i had a funny thing one time a guy flipped me off because 
he was going slow vocnoise and uh sil i got all sil pissed off about 
him and went around him and everything yknow and sil i go to cutoffaashland sil 
work sil pull in at ashland chemical and who pulls in beside me but him 
sil i look over at him he looks at me like sil oh sil yknow 
im sorry i mean yknow i was iver umhum iver no we just sil both 
happen to work there iver umhum iver its over off of uh sil thirty three 
sil two seventy and thirty three errortuttermawtuttlemall tuttle mall around tuttle mall thirteen years uhhuh 
uhhuh uhhuh iver uh sil i was going through a divorce parents sil both parents 
passed away uh sil my ex moved to saint louis didnt sil tell me anything 
about it or foreclosing on the house and thats how i found out she moved 
and sil just a bunch of sil shit and sil i just started uh sil 
screwing up sil so they wanted to sil put me on probation and my uh 
sil rebellious attitude or whatever said sil i quit sil was pretty stupid really but 
iver umhum iver yknow what happened like in the same sil year eighty eight sil 
yknow so sil but it was sil it was sil pretty tough but i just 
didnt deal with it properly yknow sil i shouldve went and got counseling and by 
the way i probably shouldve got sil marriage counseling but i refused to do that 
too so sil but i didnt think i had a problem i thought she was 
the one with one iver umhum iver vocnoise umhum iver umhum iver but shes doing 
fine sil um sil she was dating somebody i dont know whether they really got 
married or not yknow because i dont really have that much communication with her but 
sil some guy younger than her and sil i talked to him he seemed like 
pretty decent guy sil yeah iver well it was rough iver not the actually going 
through it yknow sil to me sil it was to her sil but the aftermath 
basically yknow you errorgisjust iver at each others throat for this that and the other 
and sil and sil yknow devon is uh my daughters the one that really got 
sil put in the middle of it yknow and vocnoise probably it was a blessing 
that they moved to saint louis because there probably couldve been more uh sil problems 
sil legal problems yknow as far as uh sil going back and forth to court 
and sil putting her on the witness stand for stupid stuff yknow and sil so 
sil uh sil in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 
iver no ive never ive i used to uh sil have an office out there 
that i visited all the time but uh sil ive never been out there to 
sil she actually lives in kirkwood sil which is a suburb iver umhum iver so 
uh sil thats where she went to high school and everything uh sil but i 
had no ive never went out there sil uh my my ex still has family 
here so sil she comes back a couple three times a year and sil i 
generally try to hook up with her sil and sil its been a while but 
as she got older yknow she wants to be with sil with her uh sil 
playmates and everything as they get older yknow so sil and sil having went through 
that myself i understand that so sil no it got kind of rough to have 
her here for a couple sil three weeks out of a sil or a month 
or something like that yknow during the summer iver umhum iver or they dont really 
give a damn thats the thing that uh sil ive got ive got some friends 
that sil with kids and sil i see it like on the bus or with 
uh yknow when youre working somewhere and uh where you sil people treat there kids 
yknow as a iver i mean i didnt have the greatest childhood i dont think 
any of us ever really had the best yknow but sil but i dont sil 
like i wouldnt sil talk to my kid the way sil some of these people 
talk to them sil but um sil one today yknow and she got on the 
bus and sil vocnoise the little girl went and set over here shes probably about 
sil eight unknown sil maybe six or something like that and she wanted to set 
here her mommy so she made her set with her which is cool sil and 
mommy just goes to sleep and the little kids trying to study her homework yknow 
for sil not that well sil i dont know was she up all night partying 
or was she up all night working yknow or sil what the hells is your 
problem iver umhum sil but the little girls setting there going sil mommy you need 
to go vocnoise help with seven like seven nine times nines sixty three yknow and 
sil her time tables and stuff yknow and sil so uh sil yeah i see 
sil like younger kids to sil with kids yknow and sil and think yknow man 
your just sil not only have you wasted cutoffyyou sil cutoffyyou cutoffsscrewed sil you screwed 
up your life youre gonna sil you also screwed up your kids yknow sil i 
was twenty sil well i was thirty one when devon was born so sil my 
ex was twenty eight sil so we were unknown sil both older sil vocnoise sil 
not that that really helped as far as iver but i think it gave her 
cutoffsosome sil and i wouldnt say i never got mad uh but sil ive gotten 
mad at devon quite a few times yknow because i didnt like to sil some 
of the things that uh sil vocnoise she would either say or sil or that 
she would do or sil uh sil but sil yknow sil i try to let 
her sil live her life yknow sil i think theres love sil nobody can sil 
teach anything unless you learn it iver umhum iver umhum sil yeah she went to 
school here till uh sil ninety one actually sil uh sil so she was sil 
lets see sil about the fourth grade sil fifth grade something like that iver umhum 
vocnoise sil yeah sil vocnoise mm vocnoise sil i think it couldve cutoffbbeen i thought 
shed get a better education out there sil uh sil now at saint louis school 
public school district she probably sil district she probably wouldve cutoffggot had the same as 
here vocnoise but by being kirkwood yknow and sil relatively small and everything sil um 
sil i think we maybe had uh sil a hundred and sil some kids in 
our graduating class yknow so sil uh i felt i got better sil attention when 
i wanted it sil yknow sil uh sil then i wouldve at a sil at 
a bigger school iver umhum iver umhum sil umhum iver yeah much too fast for 
me yknow sil my iver i know the way we yknow the way we dressed 
and everything yknow it was kind of appalling to sil to the parents and everything 
i guess maybe thats where sil im coming from i mean uh sil the way 
some of the uh sil kids dress sil yknow retro back to when with the 
bell bottoms and everything to us sil and the uh sil the piercings i just 
cant get into that yknow and sil then some of the girls i mean they 
yknow sil i mean my god they vocnoise sil at sil fourteen six fifteen years 
old they look like theyre twenty some years old yknow and thats what they want 
to look like sil plus you watch some of these stupid shows on tv yknow 
sil you sil sit there and go sil man i couldnt cutoffbbelieve cutoffmamy my daughter 
dont do that yknow its sil when shes around me sil noise sil never sil 
when shes away from me i dont know what the hell she does iver noise 
iver well i think uh sil in my opinion i think cutoffmainmainly mainly the uh 
sil cutoffiits its the absence sil of uh sil basically sil parenting yknow sil uh 
sil my mom was there sil um sil she was a housewife yknow sil and 
uh sil so she was she went to work after cutoffwwe sil i think when 
i was a sil junior in high school yknow sil and my brother they all 
my brothers and sisters are graduated yknow so iver umhum sil and that hurt her 
to go she unknowndxihdidnt thought she was letting sil yknow neglecting me i was in 
iver umhum iver thought about it ive vocnoise come home get in the car and 
go out go somewhere yknow or come home get something to eat and sil yeah 
that was about it i sil ah but vocnoise sil i think that has a 
lot to do with it um sil i dont really cutoffnknow sil know that tv 
has that much because i remember coming home as a kid and watching sil howdy 
doody and all that stuff and sil course it wasnt the uh sil violent stuff 
maybe that you can see on tv now or uh but sil i dont really 
think the media just hasnt had that much to do with it sil its just 
a different time now uh sil i mean i remember vocnoise uh sil one of 
the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast yknow with uh 
sil uh cutoffyyknow sil the vietnamese guy uh sil vietcong guy getting sil his brains 
blowed out on national tv yknow and uh sil uh sil that didnt make me 
go out and vocnoise um want to do that yknow sil so sil if anything 
it made me want not want to do it yknow because sil my brother was 
in was in vietnam sil he was in the army sil and uh when i 
got my notice hes like three years older than me yknow and hes sil so 
i mean it dont sil theyll draft you theyll put you on the front line 
sil i said well im going to sil enlist in the airforce anyway sil so 
sil as long as you uh sil see and id already i already cutoffssuspected sil 
knew i was gonna be getting a notice so sil because i flunked out like 
in december vocnoise yknow sil and uh sil so in january i had already contacted 
the navy and the airforce vocnoise uh sil about getting into their taking their tests 
and everything taking their uh sil physicals sil uh sil so iver umhum iver right 
iver umhum iver well then they had uh after that they had the lottery number 
and that wasnt sil if you were hot yknow if you got sil your number 
was picked i mean sil i dont know which would be worse knowing that youre 
gonna get sil a notice and sil being able to prepare for it or vocnoise 
uh because ive had friends that got cutoffnunumbers uh numbers and everything yknow and and 
getting a high number and sitting there going oh my god sil so iver umhum 
iver uhhuh iver vocnoise i was reading a thing though in uh vocnoise the u 
s a i think it was yesterday where uh sil your uh sil minority and 
your your uh vocnoise uh majority yknow uh sil its always been that well yknow 
they were sil trying to make it seem like its sil different its always but 
like yknow sil like the army has always been forty percent vocnoise sil uh minority 
and sil sixty percent or something like that yknow that uh sil airforce has always 
been sil uh sil like sil seventy thirty or something like that yknow because the 
standards are a little bit higher to get in and a lot of people dont 
want to get into that yknow they dont want to take them tests and everything 
yknow sil uh my vocnoise uh sil a cousin that vocnoise was a uh sil 
spent sil twenty five years i think in the army because thats sil he couldve 
done better but thats all he wanted to noisedo unknown yknow sil be a drill 
sergeant and stuff like that yknow sil but uh sil cutoffii sil cutoffii i just 
think a lot cutoffoof lot of times the media iver uh sil and research and 
stuff like that to do a lot of things that were sil done sil years 
ago iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver they always been there i 
mean yknow and uh i dont really care what the uh sil guys sil specific 
thing is if hes in a fox hole with me yknow and sil as long 
as he can shoot a laughguni vocnoise yknow i mean vocnoise i could care cutoffleless 
ive got gay friends yknow so iver sil i think its better probably at the 
vocnoise dont let them say anything about it yknow sil and most of the people 
will sil yknow like when you get to a sil i lived in the barracks 
a lot of time but i mean vocnoise yknow vocnoise lot of people yknow they 
get their own places off base yknow and sil who cares what they are i 
mean i dont care sil yknow sil like say i have cutoffffriends gay friends that 
sil yknow and sil i dont care what they do i mean if vocnoise sil 
laughtheyre old enough to do whatever the heck sil they want to do yknow iver 
umhum iver umhum vocnoise iver umhum sil yeah i vocnoise well i think basically that 
goes back to uh sil yknow the parenting and everything yknow there was something sil 
missing in the uh sil uh the childs life yknow uh sil uh i bet 
he wasnt getting perhaps sil attention sil uh those sil kids in particular i dont 
sil understand how they could be building bombs in sil in their basement and mom 
and dad not know what was going on yknow i mean sil uh its just 
tragedy sil i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh sil 
uh sil we were like sil i dont know uh sil eleven years old or 
something like that well an accidental shooting him in sil him and the sil uh 
another friend of mine from the same vocnoise same class yknow sil um sil he 
pulled a gun and shot him yknow and didnt know that the damn thing was 
loaded but sil and they were talking about another thing about that yknow where some 
sil kid i guess that happened just here in town uh sil couple about a 
week ago or something like that yknow where a guy sil shot another guy but 
sil i mean sil those things are just sil senseless crimes really yknow sil and 
whos really to fault and whos really at cutoffgguilty sil whos guilty i dont know 
vocnoise uh sil id like to have uh sil not that theyd ever would have 
but if if sil one of the two that you that cutoffccolumbine errorculombinecolumbine yknow if 
they would have survived id like to seen what was going through their heads yknow 
sil but thats something well never know iver umhum iver umhum sil but thats kind 
of it sil it unknown sil yknow kind of came through where they were like 
uh sil when i was growing up we had the uh sil the sil yknow 
you had your jocks and everything of course and you had your uh sil cutoffwwe 
cutoffccalled we were called deads yknow sil uh sil and i was kind of like 
in the middle yknow of it sil i played a little bit of sport yknow 
but i also associated with them and they were basically potheads yknow and everything so 
sil uh sil so like i say i cutoffbbut sil yknow unknown i was kind 
of uh associated with both of them but then the football players yknow unknown sil 
some of them were uh sil pretty uh sil pretty much asses yknow sil no 
other way to put it especially if they were sil got scholarships and stuff yknow 
they were sil mean they could be real sil uh sil nasty vocnoise but uh 
noise sil i just cant cutoffssee i dont know i just think maybe unknownif i 
dont know looking at it back is like uh well ive got into arguments with 
a few of them and then seen them later on yknow and sil its like 
sil hey man yknow sil let me buy you beer yknow or whatever yknow unknown 
sorry about what happened we were sil yknow sil shoot it happened five years ago 
yknow i dont vocnoise i try to forget things that sil yknow i mean sil 
my mind vocnoise got enough to absorb yknow without sil worrying about uh which i 
do worry quite a bit about things but vocnoise uh sil about stupid stuff uh 
sil like that kind of yknow somebody gets mad at you because you were a 
sil your a not a jock or yknow youre youre a youre a sil youre 
a this or youre a that yknow everybody trying to label people and stuff iver 
yeah and cutoffaand and everybodys gonna associate with people that they feel comfortable with sil 
so sil yknow sil and unfortunately as that guy this guy in particular he was 
a center for the football team as he grew up sil older yknow uh sil 
he realized that he wasnt as big as important as he uh sil and he 
blew out his knee for a sil o u yknow sil i went to unknown 
cutoffsschool i went to school with larry hunter whos the a sil basketball coach for 
uh sil o u sil now sil and uh sil and he had the same 
thing happen to him uh he had uh scholarship for o u and vocnoise both 
of his knees are shot and everything but uh sil and he was a good 
ballplayer probably one best ones i ever seen and sil uh sil rivalled like a 
larry byrd yknow back in that day and everything and uh vocnoise but sil one 
heck of a nice guy yknow sil never let it get to him iver never 
thought he was any better than anybody else yknow he was always there to sil 
to help out every kid yknow sil but then some people like you say yknow 
some people arent that way iver umhum iver umhum sil they had one i was 
uh just sil heard on news this morning they were talking about some guy whos 
like seventy seven years old for vocnoise kenyon college or something the sil was throwing 
erasers at cutoffevereverybody iver iver iver iver sil sil vocnoise yeah sil but i could 
sil i could imagine iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum sil yeah but yknow the 
cutoffththe if you hit somebody in the eye obviously its gonna hurt him but yknow 
most iver could see it they sil they could be ducking i mean yknow you 
sil seventy seven years old i cant imagine being hurt by him yknow iver umhum 
iver umhum iver uhuh vocnoise uhuh sil ive sil i sil at cutofftitime at one 
time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but sil course that 
would have been im forty nine so that would have been probably what about sil 
twenty sil four sil so sil would have about twenty five years in so vocnoise 
id be right at and ready to get the heck out anyway yknow iver umhum 
iver umhum sil plus you get so many different sil students and vocnoise what i 
like sil just walking over here today yknow its vocnoise kind of thought yknow unknownthatuh 
vocnoise i wonder how many of these people i walk by yknow are gonna be 
here in sil january sil because yknow a lot of because i did yknow i 
thought well this is cool man yknow iver umhum iver uhhuh iver yeah sil should 
been in class iver umhum iver umhum iver well and and and especially in my 
situation yknow at the vocnoise i think about it quite a bit yknow if i 
wouldve had a unknownbachelors sil more of an opportunity to have a one on one 
sil uh sil relationship with her id probably uh sil uh being a girl sil 
yknow could of probably helped her out in the sil in a lot of cutoffsociosocial 
sil social things social things yknow about sil man because i vocnoise i kind of 
get the impression that she dont really that she still aint very interested in sil 
men yknow so sil much as sil its her thing yknow sil so iver umhum 
iver vocnoise so um sil but yknow i unknown uh sil yeah i think yknow 
a lot of times you think well yknow um sil when you dont even know 
you sit there say im only a phone call away yknow sil and all you 
do is call me but sil its not the same thing as sil being there 
and sil and shes sil well i remember one time when she was having a 
stomach ache she was like sil uh like twelve or thirteen years old yknow and 
sil and i said well whats the matter she goes uh vocnoise my stomach hurts 
i said uh sil well are you on you on your period or what yknow 
and she goes vocnoise dad vocnoise iver i said what yknow she goes uh sil 
well i dont talk i wont talk to you about stuff like that i said 
sil why laughim laugh im youre dad yknow for godsake she goes sil well thats 
something that sil might talk to mom about but i wouldnt talk to you about 
it and i said well thats cool but sil yknow sil just wanted to let 
you know that i do know women go through that stuff yknow sil so iver 
umhum iver umhum iver unknownnwelldarn iver umhum umhum sil that uh sil it sil it 
was sil like i say i said sil she probably sil probably thinks the same 
way yknow shed been here yknow and having trouble with boys and everything yknow when 
she was growing up but not probably would have sil could have probably sil would 
have been an ass about that kind of stuff youd think im not vocnoise sil 
how bad they were yknow if they laid a hand on her vocnoise of course 
yknow but sil but uh sil um sil but by her being away yknow then 
sil and her moms got a cool head on her shoulders she wouldnt let that 
happen sil unless she told me about it then shed be probably be afraid tell 
me that vocnoise id catch an airplane flight cutoffdodown over there or something yknow sil 
fuck the guy up or something iver noise iver so that uh yknow and sil 
vocnoise sil she would have been going to northland high school which is up here 
just awhile up where im living at one sixty one cleveland area sil then uh 
sil so sil it would have been interesting sil yknow sil to vocnoise but then 
yknow that then the other side of it yknow the unknown the sil they think 
sil women tend to have the cutoffmmore sil more emotional sil type of feelings than 
uh then men yknow we carry it on our shoulders yknow sil so uh sil 
yeah i just sil hope she sil adjusts iver umhum iver cutoffm sil uhuh enjoy 
them now sil you got the terrible twos to go through which is sil which 
is cool sil and uh sil i remember one time when we got in a 
big argument one time when she uh sil when she turned teen sil teenager sil 
and uh sil i called her up and she was on the phone with somebody 
else and i sat there and said well yknow im calling long distance she goes 
sil so im talking to my girlfriend i said sil so what hang up on 
her and call her back iver vocnoise sil you dont tell me what to do 
sil i said sil said sil well okay sil you want to call me back 
sil well bye sil feel like it or something like that sil i think she 
called me ended up calling me back couple three hours later sil and i was 
pissed so i wouldnt talk to her yknow sil little childish things that yknow sil 
well ill pay you back yknow iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver 
vocnoise i dont know another thing about the kids nowadays is that its uh and 
and devon vocnoise i experienced it with her yknow so vocnoise i sent her a 
hundred dollars one time yknow just for her and she sat there and said uh 
i called her up couple days later well about a week cutoffcoupcouple a cutoffcoucouple sil 
a week later something like that and uh sil said what did you do with 
that uh whatd you get with that money and everything she goes well yknow i

yknow and sil partied a little bit with her mcdonalds and everything sil thats one 
thing i see about kids doing nowadays a lot too is uh sil socializing like 
that sil shopping malls and sil and sil things of that nature sil umhum iver

pool hall or something yknow bar that actually yknow and theyd be a but wed

over to somebodys house yknow and sil then wed meet up later on yknow and 
go our separate ways or sil we had drive ins back then yknow wed go 
to the vocnoise a movie sil umhum sil so uh sil as far as going

see it here i mean you can sil uh sil see some nineteen year old 
or eighteen year old uh sil guy or girl or whatever yknow and sil see 
the difference in the maturity yknow of uh another couple three different sil people and 
everything uh sil i dont know whether sil vocnoise me coming from like a rural 
unknownfarm sil area yknow athens and everything uh vocnoise sil and i think it maybe 
has something to do with that even true today yknow youre more uh sil family 
oriented um sil vocnoise um sil your cutofffrfriends sil youre friends are basically yknow you 
count them on your hands which you still can but uh vocnoise sil but you 
socialize a lot more if youre in the city vocnoise sil with more people unknown 
and everything sil where if you come from like a smaller town vocnoise you tend 
to socialize with sil a certain sil people sil yknow sil group or or whatever 
sil yknow iver iver vocnoise i havent been back there for about ten sil ten 
years sil umhum sil id like to move back down there but there just isnt 
any work yknow so unless you own your own company so vocnoise mm that basically 
is remodeling dry wall and vocnoise stuff like that and iver thats the appalachia area 
yeah sil umhum sil itd be great if somebody yknow they gonna want to pump 
all this money into it but unfortunately whenever the government pumps money into an area 
yknow sil that sil tends to be like a uh sil foreign country gets it 
yknow and sil iver iver well uh here sil yeah sil they gave us ten 
thousand sil heres a dollar sil have fun iver vocnoise yeah it sil uh yeah 
they cutoffgegot theyve got two different uh articles in there uh about it well they 
had a big article uh sil back when uh sil who was it sil jesse 
jackson was down there or something sil what a couple years ago or something vocnoise 
and uh sil he made a concerted effort to sil try to let people know 
how errorpoverpoverished how sil error poverty is down there and everything vocnoise but then you 
go to a lot of other extremes yknow where you set there and these people 
wouldnt sil want to live in columbus sil so sil yknow sil you can give 
them a cutoffmmillion a million dollar house up here and sil and an income for 
the rest of their life they dont want that they want to live down where 
they sil where theyre sil feel comfortable at iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver 
umhum iver umhum vocnoise i errormovedjustjustmoved uh error moved into cutoffuupper uh up there one 
sixty one cleveland area vocnoise uh but i lived up area for years but i 
just moved back up there sil and uh sil why i left it was because 
of the sil the city sil the traffic and everything where you get around campus 
yknow its a lot vocnoise and they sell hustle hustle hustle sil but down here 
sil even with sil with the kids and everything going sil to school but basically 
its sil kind of laid back sil uh sil where up there its all sil 
go go go sil uh iver umhum sil youre going to cross the street yknow 
four lane highway and youre sitting there going sil hey iver or do you want 
to run over me sil is that what you want to do iver umhum sil 
umhum vocnoise so uh sil but sil its a noise sil an adjustment to get 
back into it but sil but i i do like it up there better as 
far as uh sil possibilities of uh sil working closer to home and stuff and 
errornatnothaving not having to worry to sil about a bus and iver umhum iver umhum 
iver umhum sil ive errorhaghad i got a couple three applications in about the krogers 
and sil uh sil uh but sil a dishwashing job for unknown sil saint angelas 
nursing home which i kind of like doing sil stuff for sil people that sil 
like that yknow sil uh i worked at a custodian sil at saint rafaels uh 
sil uh sil home for the aged sil but i had a problem dealing with 
a one on one basis with the older patients because they were sil they were 
just visiting yknow they werent there to uh stay yknow sil they were sil yknow 
you get kind of on a personal basis with them and vocnoise take couple days 
off and you come in and say what happened to sil oh she passed away 
on cutoffsusunday oh jesus unknownruinedallthe sil i told her i was bringing her a pack 
of cigarettes yknow you ever get that vocnoise so i mean uh sil yeah you 
get kind of attached to them and to them and everything and vocnoise oh or 
then they get sil sick sick yknow and sil vocnoise sil they move them up 
to i cutoffawalways useta always sit there and say yknow this is sil the only 
place i ever worked where the sil a move up sil stairs isnt a sil 
promotion yknow its iver umhum iver id like to uh sil eventually uh sil on 
immediate future yknow get something more permanent as far as work goes uh sil uh 
sil better sil standard of living uh sil uh sil im a veteran so ive 
got health care and sil but im sil need to get sil some other things 
done though sil um sil continue to um grow in wisdom yknow as far as 
uh sil maybe spirituality or something yknow uh sil and eventually get sil kind of 
my own business where yknow uh sil i have a sil want that i want 
to get a uh sil a spiritual bookstore yknow sil and then have uh sil 
things for everybody yknow just come in and sil reading room browse yknow sil read 
the stuff yknow take time off to relax because i think one of the sil 
problems with stress is uh sil and i sil think people are sil are right 
in saying that we dont get enough exercise sil but uh sil but i think 
you hafta exercise mentality something sil once in while too and unknownthat sil and that 
is trying to make it grow and do a sil to other levels of of 
uh sil atmosphere iver umhum sil inspiration motivation i useta have a business when i 
had first sil quit ashland i had a motivational tape business and everything but uh 
sil uh sil i tended to sil let that go downhill sil do the sil 
cocaine and laugh sil other things yeah iver umhum sil in the wrong cutoffatmosatmosphere it 
was just wasnt the right time and uh sil vocnoise sil it just sil i 
had money yknow fact i had sil i got like a settlement like thirty some 
thousand dollars not a settlement but when i sold my stocks and everything i got 
like thirty some thousand dollars and sil put about sil five thousand here five thousand 
there still had twenty yknow sil started a business and sil money was coming in 
sil and uh sil vocnoise using the money for other vocnoise we were using the 
money for other things and not realizing that sil hey youre cutoffsupposupposed be putting that 
money back in the business yknow sil but i was running around with sil bunch 
of other people that basically were doing the same thing yknow so sil vocnoise iver 
umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver because yeah hesi i hope to uh sil at 
forty nine yknow ive ive learned a heck of a lot uh sil lot of 
things i have sil wouldnt want to know yknow but i think laugh sil i 
think i theyve been for the good as long as you you turn them around 
and sil and make them a positive statement for you vocnoise but thats why id 
really like to have is the uh sil uh a bookstore just sil unknownmy sil 
down around campus yknow and sil people can come in and sil go over there 
and relax yknow and sil umhum iver umhum iver yeah sil yeah something the sil 
coffee uh sil doughnuts yknow or iver umhum iver but having having done it before 
yknow and uh sil knowing where i went wrong yknow sil uh sil that wouldnt 
happen again sil uh sil talk about all that shit for a while but sil 
that was again that was back in the uh sil actually it was sil in 
the nineties early nineties but yknow i was sil been doing it when we were 
sil we were sil as a recreation type of thing yknow not as a uh 
sil daily yknow sil umhum sil somebody come knocking on our door excludeyeah sil oh 
yeah okay oh yeah oh yeah sil yeah stupid sil vocnoise but id like to 
do something like that then uh sil uh i wouldnt mind having uh sil uh 
sil some kind of place for uh sil yknow you see a lot of uh 
sil different down and out type people and everything and sil and sil really nobody 
really trying to help them or nothing yknow and uh sil uh sil i like 
to think that sil maybe even this thing yknow could be like a sanctuary for 
them to come in and get some peace of mind or something yknow sil so 
sil umhum iver umhum sil umhum sil yeah i can sil im sil two thirty 
five iver yeah sil i was a little late though when i got here but

hearing myself on laughtape laughtoo laugh iver laughgood laugh iver laughokay vocnoise iver okay vocnoise 
i might want to try to adjust this a little bit again if you say

sil thats okay noise noisewelljusttrythat noise iver noisesaying noise iver okay noise vocnoise so i 
can just talk normal and it wont be too loud because i talk loud iver 
okay iver laugh sil laugh sil so when i start laughing real loud you can 
vocnoise turn it down so no one breaks their ear drums vocnoise sil laugh iver 
laugh iver yes iver thirty nine iver uh north end sil over by riverside hospital 
iver henderson olentangy iver yeah iver vocnoise um currently unemployed sil umhum iver so iver 
yeah im looking for work um taking my time looking for work vocnoise its the 
first chance that ive had in probably twenty years to sit back and get what 
i want noise so im doing that sil noiseim vocnoise getting unemployment and taking my 
time ive got sil several interviews so vocnoise some exciting ones so iver um secretarial 
sil administrative assistant sil type work iver uh im kind of happy im not doing 
that anymore it really takes a certain errorkypetype type of person to work for in 
thats hard to find vocnoise in that area so iver vocnoise cutoffiin uh in insurance 
off and on working for independent insurance agents vocnoise so i did that until i 
sil uh came to a company that i stayed with for seven years vocnoise and 
then they relocated to dallas sil so yeah iver um iver i didnt wanna go 
to dallas iver so there was a couple people that went but probably two out 
of five hundred vocnoise and nobody wanted to laughmomove sil so i stayed here iver 
oh probably my family sil my kids are here sil i have a grandchild now 
so vocnoise yeah i like to stay sil close to all them iver she is 
four months vocnoise almost five iver yeah sil so im a new grandma noise laugh 
iver laugh thanks laugh i dont feel like a grandma either so vocnoise have to 
be careful what i do they still watch me i guess vocnoise laugh vocnoise iver 
uhoh noise iver oh sil thats fun and thats a challenging age too thirteen months 
thats fun iver yeah noise iver um sil no sil i got to babysit for 
like a week and then she has a best friend thats watching her baby and 
vocnoise a friend of hers that has other kids too so its real good for 
the baby noise iver umhum iver yeah its my daughter sil yeah sil excludename sil 
umhum iver uh shes actually at uh columbus state vocnoise shes gonna study to be 
a teacher iver so shes doing that and uh iver umhum sil yeah sil yeah 
sil shes nineteen noise yeah vocnoise laugh iver oh gosh a whole lot more people 
iver laugh vocnoise whole lot more places to live seems like everywhere i turn theres 
construction and and vocnoise yknow you go down one one road and then you wait 
a couple years if you dont go in that area and sil its all changed 
sil looks all different vocnoise so and thats mainly like looking at bethel sil and 
sil three fifteen north things like that iver yeah sil think the population vocnoise um 
vocnoise in a way sil but i think it also sil leaves it open for 
all the things of sil having too many people in one area sil um vocnoise 
i dont i dont know i think the main thing that affects me now and 
since ive been home sil ive been reading the paper a lot more and vocnoise 
yknow im more aware of whats going on and vocnoise i really um gonna be 
some kind of activist sil for laugh um vocnoise i dont know a lot of 
the places that are coming up the gentlemans clubs and things like that i just 
i think thats gonna be really bad sil for the kids and and everybody around 
vocnoise um theres one off of uh bethel sil or no its off of henderson 
cahoots sil and then theres the red hot peppers or something i saw the other 
day and vocnoise i couldnt even believe theyre like right across the street from each 
other vocnoise yknow and sil its funny because you read the paper and and it 
seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but 
then they sil let all that stuff so sil thinking it really affects it noise 
sil yeah sil try to go around vocnoise laugh laughyeah vocnoise and until they make 
a womens uh club laughso vocnoise wont be real laughequal laugh laughyeah laugh iver laugh 
iver uh um vocnoise im sure that it has because it enables a lot more 
people to get housing and sil and things like that sil um vocnoise and i 
and yknow growth is always good my husbands in construction so i shouldnt be against 
it or anything but vocnoise um you kind of like to have things spread out 
and kind of yknow sil have some space sil so iver um vocnoise i work 
downtown vocnoise the last year i worked downtown and then i think about sil oh 
probably fifteen twenty years ago i worked downtown vocnoise and um vocnoise yknow as far 
as the focus you mean like nighttime things or just anything in general or iver 
yeah vocnoise well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little 
bit more i mean its smaller compared to most downtowns vocnoise i mean you sil 
yknow it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and youre out vocnoise 
laughso vocnoise i dont think it that would hurt anything and then to live there 
if they made it more affordable vocnoise that would be nice vocnoise so iver vocnoise 
uh i live up north vocnoise um sil around carl and sil uh morse road 
iver noise so i have a house iver oh noise iver noise cutoffnno laughoh then 
you wouldnt be too familiar with everything huh vocnoise noise iver umhum iver laugh iver 
northland mall iver yeah sil with all the controversy about that and polaris and vocnoise 
umhum vocnoise um vocnoise i dont know cutoffiits its sil northland is such a vocnoise 
a good location for all the people around there and its certainly not sil yknow 
um sil um sil a hurting cutoffneineighborhood or yknow a neighborhood that vocnoise people dont 
need sil the shopping so i didnt see the difference of having both sil theres 
lazarus everywhere theres sears everywhere why not have it both places vocnoise i mean i 
wouldnt particularly go up to polaris if they take northland vocnoise but were not planning 
on staying there anyway so i didnt sil yeah sil well probably move within the 
year sil umhum iver um the well sil ive had the house vocnoise excuse me 
sil um vocnoise for probably six seven years and vocnoise we just need to move 
its kind of small its a smaller house vocnoise and um sil my husband works 
in gahanna so we were gonna sil look for some houses up that way and 
vocnoise maybe some land vocnoise weve been looking at some land sil up north too 
iver umhum noise yeah vocnoise its either gonna be find a house we want or 
well go build it laughsomewhere iver oh sil a place on some land sil with 
hessome woods and uh vocnoise yeah vocnoise water things like that iver laughyeah right noise 
yeah we could put a little trailer there wed be outside most the time anyway 
so vocnoise laugh iver noise umhum vocnoise yeah sil yeah i would say anything outside 
noise like doing that iver noise umhum sil yeah sil wed like to garden sil 
and that was one of the things too we want some space to sil to 
make a bigger garden and vocnoise uh no sil uh no we kind of help 
my neighbor out hes got a big garden next laughdoor vocnoise so we help him 
and sil hes retired vocnoise oh laugh iver laugh laughokay good because i dont think 
id know that one laugh whatever looks pretty when it laughcomesout vocnoise laugh iver laugh 
iver uh its all over they contract with dominion homes sil and dominion is seems 
like its going up everywhere and m i sil so theyre all over vocnoise uh 
they have projects all over iver uh its not really an office hes like a 
um supervisor that just goes to the different job sites sil he cutoffggoes he tells 
the the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and 
vocnoise and then he gets to um sil talk with hesthe the other contractors vocnoise 
and he works together with them but hes really just vocnoise theres a main place 
where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites 
iver right iver yeah sil and theyre all so different but hes he deals real 
well with people sil so hes really vocnoise and hes even thinking of going into 
uh business sil for himself noise yeah he almost errordoeddid that this year and then 
he thought nah i dont want all the headaches vocnoise so hes like the top 
guy of cutoffwiwith of the people that he works for so iver yeah sil yeah 
sil itd be good though because i could take care to the books and everything 
and vocnoise do all that kind of thing so iver umhum iver yeah sil yeah 
we probably eventually will do that vocnoise but im like so up in the air 
about what i wanna do and theres laughso many things to do out there that 
vocnoise i need to take time to think about it iver so iver no vocnoise 
laugh vocnoise no vocnoise i really dont ive done uh ive done a variety of 
uh vocnoise different sil things and then also um vocnoise just reading sil and and 
things uh since ive been off and vocnoise i cutoffwantewanted i wanted to go back 
to school i thought about that and sil i wanna do something with kids vocnoise 
i almost thought of opening my own daycare center sil but then i didnt know 
if i wanted to get into that and iver so vocnoise just trying to vocnoise 
take my time sil do what i wanna do sil yeah iver oh sil noise 
sil um iver yeah vocnoise well and thats good for the baby sil too iver 
yeah iver oh sil vocnoise gosh i hate thats really going around a lot iver 
laugh iver well vocnoise um sil lets see i got divorced when my oldest was 
three and my youngest was about six months almost a year vocnoise so ive sil 
ive raised them basically myself sil yeah so i did go back to work iver 
uh hesssix five years ago almost five years ago couple months sil short of that 
sil oh laughyeah laugh iver yeah sil i um well and that was really um 
sil struggle sil yknow a struggle for money and everything so vocnoise i would take 
whatever would come along sil and when you work in secure sil jobs like that 
i mean you i had a different job sil every year vocnoise i mean a 
year would come up and id say okay here we go vocnoise yknow theyre either 
gonna downsize or theyre gonna vocnoise do something and they always did so i was 
never really shocked sil and i didnt panic or anything hesand i was never without 
a job and never had to vocnoise i never missed um sil yknow vocnoise i 
would say it would take sil probably two weeks sil at the most sil before 
i would be working again vocnoise yeah iver umhum iver yeah sil eighty four noise 
iver yeah iver um sil yeah pretty good for secretarial administrative type work i mean 
everybodys always looking for that iver so but i had some really tough challenging jobs 
and vocnoise yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be 
a millionaire with all the lawsuits of vocnoise different yeah i experience with vocnoise um 
sexual harassment iver yeah real bad and and it was vocnoise yknow mainly um vocnoise 
no one talked about it iver yknow i mean it was just like vocnoise and 
then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else vocnoise so you 
would never wanna vocnoise cutoffssay yknow ever say anything vocnoise but um yeah that cutoffiit 
iver well iver i walked out and uh it wasnt quietly sil and i laughwalked 
laughout vocnoise but it felt good sil and uh sil and i didnt even know 
if i was gonna be living in the streets vocnoise but ill never forget the 
day yknow and his wife worked in the office too vocnoise so i went to 
her and i said it was nice working with you im going home yknow vocnoise 
can reach me at home vocnoise and then he was shocked and he just couldnt 
believe it and he said you cant do this vocnoise he says i wont pay 
you vocnoise and i said cutoffwwatch sil uh yknow watch me walk out the door 
and i dont want any money yknow vocnoise so i left out vocnoise um sil 
oh it was just a sil a long drawn out thing i mean it cutoffthithis 
started out with little things vocnoise and then it just got bigger like vocnoise um 
sil he had an office sil off of the main office and it was a 
pretty prominent uh insurance company vocnoise and he had his own um agency and he 
was a successful i mean hes probably still is out there very successful vocnoise but 
i was doing some computer training and he was walking me to the other side 
of the vocnoise building vocnoise and he locked the door sil and turned around vocnoise 
he said why dont you get the errorfirstfront or the front door sil and it 
was only he and i in the office yknow and every once in a while 
his wife would be in there vocnoise and i just i lost it i was 
i uh vocnoise i was mad but i i didnt want him to think that 
i was afraid vocnoise i wanted to vocnoise be of him to be afraid of 
me vocnoise so i just sil i stomped back to my desk vocnoise and i 
said oh extgreat i said not only are you a pain to work with i 
have to be afraid of you vocnoise and then i think i did scare him 
because he start yknow he backed off a lot vocnoise and sil just his personality 
and his his vocnoise and then that that was a real um sil slap in 
the face for him vocnoise so he was really mean after that so i left 
i just i walked out vocnoise i picked the kids up at the bus stop 
and theyre like mommy what are you doing vocnoise i said were going somewhere cutoffkikids 
cutofflelets get in the laughcar laugh so vocnoise but um sil yeah just couple experiences 
like that though make you do other things so vocnoise yknow i stayed sil tough 
and i sil yknow got other jobs and iver was pretty good never had to 
borrow any money vocnoise never went on welfare vocnoise didnt vocnoise i think i was 
on food stamps or something for a month iver when i first sil yknow sil 
got a divorce vocnoise so its been hard iver um uh sil he was in 
so much trouble sil and he was vocnoise that was the main reason why i 
didnt stay with him is he was just draining on me and vocnoise pulling me 
down so vocnoise he was never really there he was in and out of jail 
all the time vocnoise and i would go through the whole vocnoise um sil cutoffchuhchild 
sil bureau child support sil that whole thing and that was a sil total mess 
vocnoise hed have wasted all the time to go down there to court appearances and 
all this other stuff well vocnoise it turned out he could just move iver he 
found out he could just move vocnoise yeah so yknow he always got away from 
that iver oh yeah iver umhum iver yeah sil i think theyre really helpful and 
i think that its the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids 
can make it theres really vocnoise but theres so much fraud sil and theres so 
many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really 
need it vocnoise yknow like with me i didnt wanna stay on it i wanted 
to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it vocnoise but if 
sil i cutoffw didnt have the ambition vocnoise that that i had i might have 
stayed home theres like nine yknow vocnoise there was even a mother that lived across 
from me in my apartment complex that vocnoise i would get up and go to 
work every day vocnoise and she would have food delivered to the her front step 
vocnoise and she drove that years hescar sil i mean she had a brand new 
vocnoise yknow like whatever year it was thats the car she had and i vocnoise 
i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it 
and vocnoise yknow i thought iver yeah sil yeah vocnoise yeah she probably got um 
vocnoise i dont know maybe even she sold drugs or yknow whatever kind of way 
she made her money vocnoise but it wouldnt have been enough sil welfare wise to 
get a sil car and to iver support the her sil living conditions or whatever 
vocnoise iver umhum iver yeah iver yeah you can hide a lot of that and 
get away with it for long time which yknow im sure she did vocnoise i 
dont know i always thought sil um vocnoise i always thought it would be neat 
to have sil a system like the police have vocnoise if you dont pay a 
speeding ticket theres a warrant for your arrest and they come after you sil vocnoise 
if you dont make a child support payment vocnoise they should do the same thing 
i dont know why they dont have a system like that iver yeah i think 
thats cutoffprobabaprobably yknow im im not that familiar with it now but vocnoise i think 
that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that the 
people fall through iver vocnoise yeah thats iver right iver right sil noise sil yep 
vocnoise but uh fifty dollars a week iver yknow you can do anything for fifty 
dollars a week yknow you could work two two hours a day vocnoise yknow for 
a week and and fifty dollars for two kids vocnoise is really not that much 
a week so iver thatd be two hundred dollars a month iver vocnoise yeah that 
was the most somebody could be vocnoise um ordered to pay vocnoise being unemployed iver 
and i think cutoff yeah eighty four iver yeah so they adjusted that but then 
they didnt have any way to vocnoise um sil enforce that so iver vocnoise iver 
yeah iver well iver vocnoise i was gonna say i ive seen situations too where 
i can see their side of it vocnoise as well because vocnoise the mothers are 
used to or the wives are used to being home sil and the husbands support 
them and in those situations they still want them to vocnoise they still dont want 
to go out there and do that and vocnoise um sil and sil yknow they 
need to look at each one of those cases too vocnoise because i know theres 
alimony and all that kind of thing and vocnoise and that can be vocnoise detrimental 
to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have 
another wife and yknow iver and he does have a responsibility but i think there 
can be a line drawn sil to how responsible he is and vocnoise how capable 
the other half would have been yknow vocnoise iver right iver right iver oh yeah 
noise yeah iver laugh vocnoise iver yeah well theres too many situations out there sil 
to have everybody fit in to certain noise ones that just everyone of thems different 
vocnoise iver not really sil no i was too proud vocnoise i would have never 
vocnoise i would have never vocnoise i think my dad paid my first months rent 
noise for me though vocnoise i paid him back vocnoise and then i never i 
never wanted to borrow any money vocnoise i guess just growing up sil the youngest 
of five vocnoise i appreciated sil money iver and i didnt even want yknow and 
i knew vocnoise my mom is like if she can save a nickel somewhere yknow 
she will vocnoise so i knew that thats how they were and i didnt want 
to yknow it was my choice to get married it was my choice to have 
kids and vocnoise yknow i didnt i didnt feel noise the need to ask them 
vocnoise um well i think iver yeah noise yeah sil yeah vocnoise yeah so iver 
vocnoise yeah theyre ok theyre parents theyre in their seventies now laugh i sil i 
take what i need and leave the rest because theyve got their own opinions that 
are vocnoise a lot different than mine sil so iver vocnoise uh my brother lives 
in connecticut vocnoise um and hes uh with a cement company vocnoise concrete noise im 
not even really sure ive never even seen him sil hesand where he lives vocnoise 
seen pictures and he comes and visits a lot but ive never vocnoise gone up 
there vocnoise um and his wifes an opera singer so shes real busy and vocnoise 
they they just are madly in love he got divorced after seventeen years of sil 
marriage vocnoise and found the wife that he has now theyve been married for probably 
almost sil oh i dont know vocnoise seven eight years vocnoise and theyre real happy 
sil and his kids are grown and they have kids and vocnoise yeah the family 
is really pretty big the immediate family just us is thirty two vocnoise with our 
husbands wives and kids sil yeah vocnoise so then i have another sister hesthe that 
was married to a doctor and just recently divorced vocnoise shes one of the ones 
that wants to laughstayhome vocnoise laughandhave laugh its unfair yknow life is unfair nothing ever 
works and vocnoise so um shes living in akron sil in a house completely paid 
for by herself noise and vocnoise lives out in the middle of nowhere and complains 
how lonely she is vocnoise laugh then i told her if it was me vocnoise 
completely alone id be in the middle of a city somewhere sil yknow where you 
see people and vocnoise i dont know yknow its just sil you can always see 
what someone else sil should do or could do whatever vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise 
sil i shes always trying to recruit people to come and laughvisither vocnoise but its 
like a two hour drive sil and then sil everybodys busy yknow thats four hours 
of driving vocnoise and um sil i dont know its just too hard to sil 
keep everybody sil in touch that way vocnoise but iver vocnoise yeah i have two 
other sisters vocnoise vocnoise um sil one of them is well its funny because were 
all divorced sil out the five of us were all on vocnoise one of them 
is on her third marriage and were all on our second vocnoise except for one 
shes divorced and she hasnt remarried vocnoise and then my oldest that i told you 
in akron i guess shes not remarried iver yeah noise four girls iver umhum vocnoise 
yeah sil and then my other sister vocnoise just recently got divorced sil um this 
year sil or i guess it was um final end of last year vocnoise and 
shes got two kids sil and raising them and vocnoise so theyre all um most 
of them except for um linda and bobby vocnoise bobbys the one in sil uh 
connecticut and lindas in akron vocnoise but everybody else is within ten minutes of each 
other iver ten fifteen minutes vocnoise so sil yeah we stay pretty close see each 
other a lot noise vocnoise iver yeah and im closer to the ones that that 
feel the same way i do about laughthings vocnoise my oldest sister yknow vocnoise i 
can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things 
that yeah i dont stay on very long with her iver oh its real negative 
shes real negative about things and vocnoise and tries to put me down for being 
positive or vocnoise yknow i always see a way out of something and she doesnt 
sil and she i think she gets kind of mad vocnoise and plus she is 
feels like shes old at fifty and i said oh my gosh vocnoise you dont 
even have any bad habits i said vocnoise yknow you could live to be a 
hundred thats fifty more years vocnoise yknow i mean if you look at it that 
way sil shes really vocnoise yknow fifty is not old sil at all to me 
i mean thats just vocnoise you as much as you learn sil yknow vocnoise you 
cant trade but vocnoise yeah my my one sister thats um sil exactly seven years 
older than me vocnoise were the closest vocnoise and then the sister thats two years 
older than me vocnoise shes the same way sil she does a lot of things 
that im like why are you doing that yknow vocnoise dont laughdothat vocnoise so shes 
she pretty much stays noise low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes 
through but vocnoise iver oh yeah yeah we all get together vocnoise we have to 
get a shelter house now somewhere because uh laughnobodyshouse is big enough vocnoise well and 
then we have so many little kids vocnoise that its great because uh we just 
go to a shelter vocnoise inside and they have it you know like for christmas 
and things like that and vocnoise they can run around the kids run around and 
vocnoise iver yeah vocnoise and then you can stay as long as you want you 
dont sil yknow feel obligated vocnoise and everybody just brings in food vocnoise yknow everybody 
brings their own stuff and its fun weve vocnoise yeah it is vocnoise from thanksgiving 
to christmas i mean its just nonstop sil family everywhere vocnoise so its fun iver 
laugh laugh not me its too cutoffexpensiexpensive laugh vocnoise iver oh iver yeah vocnoise i 
contributed to too many people theres too many people theres not enough committment vocnoise its 
too easy to get divorced sil and vocnoise it uh the competition sil i mean 
theres just tons and tons of vocnoise um just people noise everywhere and vocnoise young 
people today i dont sil i yknow i dont know what the statistics are gonna 
be but vocnoise they sil i dont think they have a good idea of what 
marriage even is vocnoise yknow before vocnoise and also before a marriage was a committment 
to hesa a type of lifestyle vocnoise and that lifestyles gone everybodys independent vocnoise everybodys 
going their own ways vocnoise and if you happen to be lucky enough to find 
somebody that vocnoise is looking in the same direction you are and vocnoise is equally 
as independent sil then cutoffthethen might it might work vocnoise but um sil i yknow 
vocnoise and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them 
was an individual vocnoise situation vocnoise and uh iver vocnoise iver oh yeah noise yeah 
vocnoise iver yeah i know i was really young when i met my husband i 
was fourteen vocnoise in high school so we kind of grew up together and vocnoise 
i didnt know anything else vocnoise and um just two complete different people sil yknow 
different needs and vocnoise everything else so iver yeah well i didnt realize that until 
i had kids vocnoise iver and i had two little girls vocnoise and i thought 
wait a minute yknow i my whole life changed because vocnoise my committment was to 
them and to vocnoise yknow get all the opportunities that were out there for them 
vocnoise and sil and it just didnt happen that yknow sil well that we both 
had the same vocnoise he wanted everything to be the same laugh yknow vocnoise so 
i think that really changed everything sil one could have noise it does youre whole 
focus changes because sil everything you say somebodys listening and everything you want to do 
somebodys watching and vocnoise yknow you have to be a good example vocnoise i mean 
if you vocnoise if youre just that for your noisekids noise then noisethats all they 
noiseneed vocnoise yknow you might not always do the right things or say the right 
things but vocnoise if youre taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do 
the noiserightthings then vocnoise think thats the best you can do for them iver well 
vocnoise uh yeah i think its real important to really good uh sil get a 
good sil extuh feel for how you are and vocnoise all your beliefs and all 
that they have to really match sil and um sil vocnoise and if they dont 
vocnoise um sil then its not ever going to work because because theres always gonna 
be vocnoise conflict and vocnoise friction and all that kind of thing so i think 
its real important vocnoise and theres no age limit on that to when you really 
feel noisegood about yourself and you really know what you want to do vocnoise then 
thats the only time that you can really commit sil vocnoise and say yeah we 
do have a mutual vocnoise thing vocnoise and young people vocnoise sil their sil yknow 
theres so many different infatuations to start with vocnoise that they get blinded and they 
get sil yknow vocnoise off course and everything else and vocnoise and then it doesnt 
stay the same vocnoise i mean its all exciting and vocnoise and all that sil 
and then it yknow i think its kind of vocnoise laugh iver vocnoise oh yeah 
vocnoise i was never gonna get married again i had my house my kids yknow 
i had already done that vocnoise i was financially secure and i didnt vocnoise i 
wasnt even looking vocnoise one of my best friends though at the time vocnoise uh 
she saw this sil guy she cutoffiyhe he was the roommate of a guy she 
was seeing vocnoise and i talked to this girl sil every day and shes like 
sil oh you have to meet him you have to meet him vocnoise i was 
like oh yknow call me tomorrow i dont laughwantto meet anybody vocnoise so it took 
a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were 
vocnoise she was right vocnoise i mean uh we were like inseparable from vocnoise probably 
of two weeks sil after we met sil we just ive vocnoise havent been without 
him vocnoise so iver yeah sil and its been five years this year that weve 
been married vocnoise and uh close to seven that ive known him so noise vocnoise 
and its still just as exciting its still just as good and vocnoise yeah he 
amazes me everyday because im sil im one to sil all this wont last forever 
but sil yknow vocnoise laugh and hes like well when were ninety laugh yknow youll 
know laugh vocnoise so iver laugh iver yeah vocnoise i know sil its good one 
of us laughfeelsthatway laugh iver noiseno vocnoise no but he has a daughter sil and 
that was from high school vocnoise um vocnoise his girlfriend sil yeah i got pregnant 
sil and then vocnoise he stayed with her and they tried to work noisethings out 
and they never got married and vocnoise that was when you lived in canada noise 
vocnoise so she lives in canada now and he goes sil yknow he talks to 
her all the time vocnoise and then theyre real sil open about that i mean 
shes real good about letting vocnoise the little girl come sil and shell stay the 
noisesummerwith us and vocnoise yknow hell drive up there and see her noisetoo iver uhhuh 
sil his daughters twelve iver yeah iver yeah iver vocnoise um seventeen and nineteen iver 
yeah iver yeah iver yeah and sil uh shes adorable iver uh shes real good 
vocnoise sil yeah vocnoise yeah everythings healthy vocnoise and great um sil vocnoise she and 
then my daughter i mean i think shes just gonna be a real good influence 
shes a single mom vocnoise and um vocnoise the father vocnoise is in another relationship 
and probably on his way to be getting married and vocnoise yknow so it doesnt 
look like hes gonna be in the picture that much vocnoise and vocnoise she had 
trouble trying to decide whether she wanted him sil to be too vocnoise so sil 
because you iver right iver noiseum he doesnt seem sil he doesnt seem to have 
any problem its always been yknow what ever she laughwants i know vocnoise so far 
sil its worked out sil pretty well so yknow im sure in a situation like 
that things are gonna come up vocnoise sil but well well deal with it iver 
yeah iver extno vocnoise no laughshewa laugh iver yeah vocnoise well she stayed um sil 
she stayed with us sil like for the first noiseweek vocnoise and then she was 
done she was like ready to go vocnoise so and that was okay but vocnoise 
her apartment vocnoise lease was up sil the sil uh week vocnoise that she was 
in the hospital having the baby vocnoise so i had to move her vocnoise and 
uh my husbands family was visiting at the time sil and so vocnoise his mom 
stayed she lives in florida sil and she stayed with me vocnoise and helped me 
pack her whole apartment sil and vocnoise get her in to her new apartment and 
vocnoise and that was just yknow iver well i know laugh and yknow when i 
think back about that week that was just crazy sil because it was on a 
saturday morning she went into labor sil so i was up sil all night sil 
saturday and vocnoise all day sunday i didnt get home till sil sunday night sil 
and then sil cutoffhihis sil oh his his brother from vancouver vocnoise his daughter from 
canada sil and his sil mom from florida sil were staying with us sil and 
they were leaving that tuesday vocnoise so vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah it was like vocnoise 
yeah uh excludename was vocnoise five weeks early sil delivering vocnoise so it was really 
yknow unplanned as far as when we were expecting it iver yeah iver laugh you 
were past ready laugh sil yeah sil laugh sil laugh iver yeah iver vocnoise iver 
oh gosh iver oh iver vocnoise sil well sil when you think about the different 
generations and things we certainly didnt have the things to worry about sil noisethatpeopledonow vocnoise 
who knows in elementary and junior high and vocnoise we would have never dreamed vocnoise 
of anybody having good noisegun noise or even in let alone a knife vocnoise i 
mean that vocnoise and thats violence and thats that goes back to kids vocnoise and 
how much time and and effort you put in to them vocnoise yknow kids are 
ignored and pushed aside and theyre in the way and theres so many people that 
vocnoise dont even want them and vocnoise yknow and then they get in to school 
and they get violent sil and they they take it out hesuh yknow and everybodys 
surprised vocnoise yknow vocnoise im not because i know theres a lot of anger and 
a lot of hate for these little kids vocnoise and um sil and going to 
school vocnoise is getting to be so dangerous vocnoise i think vocnoise because you have 
so many of them in one little room vocnoise and theyre coming from so many 
different backgrounds vocnoise and if you take each one of their situations vocnoise i can 
bet the statistics as time goes on vocnoise that vocnoise they cutoffdidid vocnoise theyre not 
gonna have vocnoise one caring parent sil yknow maybe not even one of the parents 
sil yknow they might have a foster family or vocnoise yknow somebody that wants to 
pretend like they care yknow theres a lot of the people that vocnoise that are 
foster families that only want the money sil yknow and vocnoise and theres cutoffththat all 
that so sil its sil its really scary and i think sil i think that 
it had something has to be done real noisefastidontknowwhat vocnoise i think it starts from 
vocnoise what we teach them vocnoise and as adults what we allow sil to be 
out there vocnoise the computers vocnoise i mean oh my gosh vocnoise i didnt even 
get a computer because i was so afraid of what vocnoise they could be able 
to vocnoise access there was not vocnoise yknow vocnoise there was nothing barred at vocnoise 
all when they first came out vocnoise yeah vocnoise and yknow where are all those 
software people theyre not responsible for vocnoise y two k theyre not responsible for vocnoise 
yknow all this internet access to all the stuff vocnoise so its really hard iver 
vocnoise sil well when you have formulas to make bombs and yknow iver how to 
vocnoise uh step by step of how to commit suicide and vocnoise yeah they have 
to be responsible i think vocnoise because yknow you put an idea in to somebodys 
head and then vocnoise when you give them the resources to carry noisethese those things 
out vocnoise i think its vocnoise it has to be noiseresponsible for a lot of 
it iver yeah iver yeah iver but it sil and its sil its parents that 
fight for sil the noisesociety vocnoise and the whats in your community vocnoise yknow the 
parents for each individual child vocnoise they have to all form together as a group 
vocnoise and almost be vocnoise all parents to vocnoise all these kids sil as a 
group vocnoise yknow its not vocnoise you can be the best parent in the world 
at home sil and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer 
or they vocnoise get in a group of kids where their vocnoise parents they dont 
even know where they are sil yknow its the kids responsibility to get vocnoise and 
go to school vocnoise yknow maybe the mom and dad didnt even come home the 
night before but vocnoise yknow i mean theres all different kinds of situations vocnoise so 
i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what 
vocnoise all the kids are being vocnoise um sil shown and sil and have access 
to iver yeah iver yeah you really do sil yeah iver oh yeah sil yeah 
sil right and you know whats gonna happen sil its only when it gets so 
bad sil that they cant even walk to their car they cant even go to 
sil to the store vocnoise without being affected by that they cant say that anymore 
sil yknow its the people that vocnoise if i dont see it its not there 
sil theyre the ones that are gonna be the most shocked sil and theyre the 
ones that are gonna be vocnoise panicked sil when everything yknow because its getting smaller 
the worlds getting smaller were sil were more populated now than we ever have been 
sil so people need to learn to work together and to be together sil and 
iver gosh vocnoise yknow thats one of the things that ive really yknow when i 
read the paper i think wow what can you do vocnoise it has to start 
there first sil yknow and i think if sil um sil and i laugh sil 
and this might be because im a woman but vocnoise i think if women vocnoise 
started running things vocnoise it would be a lot different than when men sil run 
things because vocnoise men tend to sil think yknow like the government and that kind 
of thing vocnoise those vocnoise kind of um vocnoise funds vocnoise that are available for 
different organizations and vocnoise theyre all geared toward things that vocnoise essentially help them sil 
as a whole sil or help um sil well vocnoise yeah but i mean not 
so much that um vocnoise its always been the womens responsibility to be responsible for 
the kids vocnoise or to care about their well being and the a sil peaceful 
environment and all that kind of thing vocnoise men are more vocnoise lets go get 
it and yknow we need more money and sil yknow theyre iver yeah more unknown 
yeah or more vocnoise yknow i dont i dont even know sil because to start 
its just such a huge problem and its gotten so out of hand vocnoise its 
gonna be everybody all together that has to work its gonna be the teachers and 
the vocnoise government and vocnoise everybody but they all have to have one common thing 
sil and it cracks me up because vocnoise were so concerned about elian sil this 
this poor little kid vocnoise everybody knows who he is vocnoise but vocnoise sil yknow 
you look at our own kids we dont even care about our own kids as 
much as we care vocnoise i mean heres this little kid vocnoise who still has 
a living parent sil and and i dont understand that at all i mean that 
is just so vocnoise i think the government gets involved in sil totally yknow sil 
way out of line vocnoise and iver yeah yeah vocnoise i dont i dont know 
but it then then they second guess vocnoise the mother and she risked her life 
and all and they noise they cant do that vocnoise i mean yknow its too 
bad that sil yknow she wasnt there to vocnoise to go on with what they 
were planning on doing but vocnoise its not our right to to take other countries 
kids even vocnoise i mean thats another thing vocnoise i mean come to america well 
take everyone and every yknow vocnoise but then we have all these this crime sil 
because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean thats all theyve 
grown up with sil is the terrorist activities and vocnoise the mentality and all that 
they come here and if they cant make it sil then theyll just bomb somewhere 
and sil then laugh but i see a lot of that too a lot of 
the crime is a lot of foreign things that yknow you uh you kind of 
vocnoise wanna do a study of how long theyve been here and sil yknow vocnoise 
thatd be interesting vocnoise um i think theres gotta be a line drawn sil and 
i think that um sil yknow if theyre sil if theyre caught um and and 
its any kind of crime or anything and i know they send them back vocnoise 
sil but um sil i just think that were just too open with that and 
theres gotta be a line to say vocnoise this is as many people as as 
we care to yknow sil i mean and i know thats hard but sil vocnoise 
and its hard to draw the line but then other countries sil if its so 
miserable there sil then they need to work on their sil country sil because iver 
whoa i yeah really sil laugh iver um iver yeah one is still in high 
school and she sil shes ready to she wants to go on to college sil 
so shes pretty much sil ready sil to go i mean she do shes got 
one more year sil of high school but sil uh and i held her back 
in kindergarten vocnoise so shes vocnoise older graduate shell be nineteen when she graduates sil 
and then excludename on the other hand graduated when she was seventeen sil so sil 
um sil then my youngest daughter amy she is uh vocnoise shes doing real well 
i mean shes getting really good grades as and bs sil and um vocnoise with 
excludename sil she had kind of a hard time sil in high school sil she 
was sil uh raped sil by a teacher in ninth grade sil when she first 
went into a school sil and from there its just been a nightmare of what 
sil how that its affected her sil yknow anything she goes through you blame it 
on that or you go back and you say oh i wonder sil you know 
if she was like that because of this and sil yknow so thats been a 
real struggle and high school sil i was sil i never really sil was that 
um excited about it for her because the memories she has sil she went on 
to a different school and she met a lot of good people there vocnoise and 
she iver yeah sil yeah ever authority figures at all sil yknow shes shes really 
strong about that though because vocnoise um sil she doesnt look at anybody being sil 
be uh vocnoise yknow maybe sil more wiser more experienced in things but sil yknow 
certainly she doesnt trust anybody iver yeah laugh sil yeah and thats the thing about 
schools too vocnoise yknow vocnoise i vocnoise totally disagree with uniforms sil yknow unless its 
sil all slacks sil all of it vocnoise because you get the vocnoise the girls 
in the uniforms and theyre short sil and they cant enforce that they dont enforce 
that sil and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this 
one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row sil i should 
have went and met him sil or i should have said hey yknow hey this 
uh yknow vocnoise havent met me and i and i really vocnoise yknow fault myself 
for that sil but its made me more aware too and i sil yknow when 
you look at someone and you say oh you would never dream that they vocnoise 
well i do sil yknow there isnt anything i dont sil put past anybody doing 
vocnoise i really dont cause they just sil yeah sil oh laugh laughno no no 
i do because theres some good ones out there theres some bad ones too but 
yknow iver yeah vocnoise um its awareness again sil i mean sil yknow put two 
and two together you get some young vocnoise teachers sil right out of of college 
sil and then you put em with all these high school girls and these girls 
are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean vocnoise you cant even sil you 
cant control the attraction there sil but you can be aware of it sil and 
you can sil you can um vocnoise sil put the put slacks on girls and 
not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and vocnoise 
yknow and vocnoise theyve got stairs up and down and vocnoise yknow they get in 
their lockers and they bend over yknow and thats sil thats just too much vocnoise 
i mean i think thats the first thing that has to be done take away 
vocnoise that yknow they shouldnt even be vocnoise uh that shouldnt even be a thought 
sil yknow vocnoise and its distracting enough for the the guys their own age vocnoise 
but then you put these young teachers in there maybe theyre single guys that were 
just had a hell of a time in hall in college vocnoise and then they 
get around all these girls and like oh my gosh vocnoise well yknow you gotta 
look at that you gotta be more aware iver vocnoise um sil i think sil 
i think that there should be sil a mandatory because you have it in big 
companies you have mandatory um sexual harassment tapes sil and sil and you learn you 
teach the girls sil that its not what they do its how they make you 
feel sil is is sil constituted as your uh sil yeah harassment there sil and 
theyre too afraid sil and then besides that they yknow theres crushes on yknow you 
cant fault the girls for having crushes and vocnoise things like that theyre going through 
enough things as it is iver but you can make them aware if somebody sil 
as an adult steps over that sil line sil or makes them uncomfortable sil yknow 
vocnoise there should be some kind of a s sil a system sil to where 
these girls the slightest bit sil yknow its anonymous its sil yknow iver probably but 
they dont they wont sil yknow vocnoise part of is they feel flattered part of 
it is like wow the yknow this guy thinks im nice looking or whatever vocnoise 
and yknow you can have a hard thing there but vocnoise then if you teach 
the teachers that theyre not gonna be quiet and theyre not gonna vocnoise yknow um 
look at this flattery iver right iver laughyeah vocnoise yknow thats thats the thing so 
vocnoise i think just being aware sil and then also vocnoise like i said with 
uh with all the vocnoise i mean vocnoise cutoffaand and im uh sil im so 
sil opinionated in this too and anybody that sil knows me vocnoise i look at 
all the advertising vocnoise i look at the advertising and i look through and like 
i see lazarus and i see kohls and i see vocnoise sears vocnoise you look 
through and you say oh okay you know youre looking for things to buy well 
then you got a two whole sil two pages vocnoise of women in bras vocnoise 
and theyre looking at the camera theyre seductively looking at the camera vocnoise and vocnoise 
youre like okay how many cutoffwowomen how many different bras do women really need vocnoise 
laughthat laughis not for the women im sorry yknow vocnoise most women by the time 
theyre cutoffbubuying buying bras know what choices they have vocnoise laughyknowthey dont need all that 
vocnoise but then its funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at 
the men vocnoise the mens heads are usually cut off vocnoise theyre not wearing any 
kind of revealing vocnoise underwear at all i mean its just so vocnoise unequal so 
vocnoise we lead these these guys or these poor boys that are growing up vocnoise 
we push all this and yknow vocnoise and then expect them to deal with it 
vocnoise yknow and they see tv shows and vocnoise and everything else that yknow vocnoise 
its okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than 
one man and shes yknow vocnoise i mean i think its what we teach our 
kids and that goes back to the government and society and vocnoise and what were 
allowed to to show our kids sil yknow you get involved in the free speech 
vocnoise and thats fine vocnoise but wait till those kids grow up vocnoise and and 
wait till those people that were pushing the free speech vocnoise gets mugged cutoffoor or 
yknow anything else happens to them iver vocnoise iver um iver the yeah um vocnoise 
cutoffgovernmagovernment or the yeah the government vocnoise mayors the yknow but then look at them 
sil i mean theres another example vocnoise well yeah well i mean laugh so thats 
not the cutoffpraproblem thats not the case but its all its an uh uh man 
too vocnoise yknow i mean i think women would be more efficient and they would 
see those things because weve had to live with them forever vocnoise yknow even g 
movies that little kids are going to see sil if theres a woman in there 
iver there shes yknow half naked vocnoise vocnoise and shes noise vocnoise should be a 
center fold somewhere vocnoise yknow and those are little cutoffkidkids yeah vocnoise disney movies cartoons 
vocnoise i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and its really 
scary vocnoise um but nobodys doing anything about it that i can see vocnoise and 
they dont really see a concern but like i said vocnoise wait till the generations 
start growing up vocnoise wait till those little kids that weve put all those things 
in their head vocnoise grows up vocnoise then theyll think wow we should have done 
something vocnoise i know well im sil im scared i hope i dont live real 
long because laugh vocnoise its its scary well and then the guy that um sil 
i dont even remember what his name was he got vocnoise a drunk driving noise 
vocnoise charge vocnoise a judge he was a judge vocnoise now hes out sil he 
went back to work on monday iver so yknow what kind of example is he 
setting for everybody else iver vocnoise oh we throw the book away sil on some 
of these other cutoffguyguys i mean the throw the key away vocnoise on some of 
these guys vocnoise and sil yknow we want set them an as an example and 
vocnoise yknow this one guy had one vocnoise d u i two years ago so 
we really cutoffhahave to hes gotta be in jail for five years yknow vocnoise then 
this judge vocnoise i mean hes got vocnoise probably ten years of history with drugs 
and alcohol vocnoise and hes still and hes still a judge laugh monday morning he 
goes to work vocnoise iver yeah sil yeah sil yeah i dont see figure that 
out i think its all sil i think its all laughfixed sil vocnoise iver yeah 
they dont know about it but then sil vocnoise yknow they vocnoise like you said 
they dont wanna see it iver yknow sil vocnoise cutoffiif vocnoise if it doesnt affect 
them its not there vocnoise and if they dont have to iver yeah vocnoise well 
peoples noise people dont have the priorities they should vocnoise yknow vocnoise what do you 
do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then 
you die vocnoise what did you do laugh yknow vocnoise did you learn anything did 
you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything noise yknow vocnoise i not 
to me if you dont have time then vocnoise yknow youre just floating along trying 
to laugh taking up space no vocnoise laugh iver yeah we noise yup sil you 
have to concentrate on whats important or it just flies by and you dont even 
see it vocnoise noise yeah iver yeah right vocnoise cant take it with you or 
something vocnoise yeah iver right sil yeah well you cant even put a price on 
it either vocnoise so its iver no vocnoise i think i thrive on stress laugh 
i think it keeps me uh going or something vocnoise but i do have to 
do something that sil is accomplishing something vocnoise i dont wanna sit in an office 
ive already done that vocnoise day in and day out working for other people that 
i dont even approve of vocnoise that are making way too much money anyway vocnoise 
laughyknow vocnoise and uh have to iver laugh laughyeah laugh well looking at me oh 
you want a dollar more yknow i mean vocnoise and theyre making thousands vocnoise um 
but yeah i dont wanna do that any more i wanna go somewhere ive got 
somebody vocnoise helping me kind of yknow um just an acquaintance of mine vocnoise um 
thats kind of a headhunter sil and ive given him the idea that vocnoise i 
wanna either work for an attorney thats gonna make some changes or vocnoise yknow do 
something that way ive got a lot of administration vocnoise yknow vocnoise and and manager 
and things like that background so vocnoise i can have fun doing what i know 
how to do but also sil accomplishing something vocnoise thats what i wanna do i 
havent found it yet ive got an interview with a radio station though and thats 
kinda vocnoise iver off the thing a laughlittlebit laugh vocnoise because thatll be fun iver 
yeah just in their corporate offices sil and that would be fun so vocnoise eventually 
ill have my own radio laughstation laugh laughthough laugh if they interviewed me and knew 
that theyd be like quick get that girl out of here vocnoise no but that 
thats like the most exciting sil thing right now is that i mean that looks 
real sil promising but vocnoise and if i do that then im gonna have to 
do something vocnoise voluntary sil or some sil uh sil voluntary work or uh vocnoise 
choices vocnoise uh i looked at that too thats choices for domestic violence vocnoise thats 
an organization that i think would be real interesting and vocnoise help me feel like 
yknow vocnoise helping people vocnoise um they give sil uh vocnoise new direction for abused 
sil sil uh wives and mothers and vocnoise um help them get on their feet 
yknow give them access to the different organizations that are out there vocnoise basically hide 
them until they can get on their own because if theyre abused the vocnoise husbands 
are like yknow a nightmare out there vocnoise so things like that sil vocnoise iver 
vocnoise vocnoise yeah id be so frustrated id probably vocnoise sil oh sil i would 
be really iver oh sil oh sil wow vocnoise oh see and shes probably really 
good vocnoise iver yeah see iver noise yup iver really vocnoise yeah sil i dont 
feel old at all i mean i vocnoise yknow a lot of people think wow 
you should know what you wanna do or yknow vocnoise and sil and i guess 
vocnoise there is different phases like uh maslows sil hierarchy sil what is that the 
um the hierarchy of needs sil errormaslermaslow vocnoise maslow vocnoise anyway vocnoise iver he has 
different levels of things that people need different ages and things like that uh vocnoise 
yknow and at forty vocnoise you you think wow yknow and you really need to 
vocnoise make a difference or do something and and i can see that cause ive 
gone through all the phases that hes talking about so vocnoise iver yeah iver vocnoise 
iver noise noise right sil yeah sil noise iver okay iver oh laugh no thats 
fine sil laugh thanks iver oh iver oh i was gonna say it would be 
interesting iver yep um okay well im not really from columbus either vocnoise ive been 
here for a little over a year now vocnoise my husband went to high school 
here vocnoise and had a cutoffddaughter sil daughter while he was in high school so 
vocnoise after he finished college he wanted to relocate here vocnoise and we kind of 
live between worthington and westerville vocnoise kind of vocnoise north vocnoise columbus vocnoise and i 
like it a lot vocnoise iver vocnoise im vocnoise ive always lived in ohio vocnoise 
so im a native ohioian vocnoise southern ohio vocnoise umhum vocnoise right now im staying 
at home with my two boys i have a one year old and a five 
year old vocnoise and um my profession is a nurse im a yeah vocnoise but 
ive sil been taking a little while off since ive had the baby laugh vocnoise 
umhum vocnoise and um vocnoise i ive pretty much have sil picked up the belief 
in attachment parenting since ive had my second child vocnoise and i cutoffcacant vocnoise its 
where you believe in breast feeding from birth vocnoise until whenever and holding yknow like 
vocnoise carrying the baby in a sling with you and vocnoise just being available for 
the babys needs and just vocnoise no not really laugh vocnoise oh i i feel 
a huge difference for me personally vocnoise um sil just in the um closeness and 
vocnoise being able to pick up on his cues a lot better vocnoise and just 
knowing his needs iver and being able to meet them quicker and sil more effectively 
i think vocnoise so yeah vocnoise oh yeah sil umhum sil umhum sil umhum sil 
umhum sil i know laugh sil umhum vocnoise thats another thing i forgot to mention 
laugh sil umhum vocnoise exactly sil just from family laugh laughyeah sil umhum vocnoise oh 
yeah sil yeah vocnoise but it was something ive learned just from the other parents 
vocnoise well cutoffmmostly vocnoise mostly mothers that vocnoise i yknow talk to is vocnoise that 
yknow vocnoise if its not necessary sil to sil say it then its necessary not 
to say it so vocnoise its just kind of a sil in your home type 
of thing and you dont really go around saying sil yeah we sleep in the 
same bed and vocnoise we breast feed still and laugh sil you just kind of 
they ask and youre like yeah well vocnoise yeah thats just the way were doing 
it so vocnoise iver vocnoise umhum iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver umhum vocnoise yeah sil 
how appaling oh yeah sil yeah sil my my family my mom especially is just 
like when are you gonna stop vocnoise doing that vocnoise yeah because hes sixteen months 
now and vocnoise i think hes tapering off quite a bit so vocnoise i think 
that hell be done soon but im not pushing him so iver i think so 
sil hes hes not being forced to go in any direction that hes not ready 
for sil yeah i was going to college and vocnoise and going to work and 
sil i mean i think that their personalities are different too though sil so he 
was very independent but im not sure that thats just sil his personality or if 
it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put being 
put and sil being in daycare from a very very young age and sil and 
then sil yknow my youngest hes never been in daycare at all sil so iver 
it just sil just kind of sil instincts i laughguess sil yeah actually there are 
sil quite a theres an vocnoise an a well pretty well known doctor that has 
a ton of books and sil i go to la leche league and sil thats 
kind of their philosophy in a way sil yeah sil just that breast feeding is 
yknow a way to mother sil and nurture and feed and yknow it sil it 
meets all of these needs its kind of like sil its just sil yeah sil 
umhum sil umhum sil umhum sil oh i believe it sil umhum vocnoise yeah sil 
well one of my la leche league leaders she has a p h d vocnoise 
and she does a lot of reading sil and she said that she actually read 
a study vocnoise that they did um for breast fed babies to bottle fed babies 
sil and they said the difference in their i q sil is equivalent to uh 
sil a regular sil bottle fed baby sil and a baby exposed to lead poisoning 
vocnoise its that much higher even cutoffclippingso so i mean its just given them that 
much of uh vocnoise better sil head start sil on development sil so sil laugh 
iver vocnoise iver vocnoise sil thats fine sil humum sil i dont sil my husband 
does but i kind of sleep between them when theyre vocnoise but right now ive 
cause weve sil early on we vocnoise took our bed down and just kind of 
had like the mattress and the boxspring on the floor vocnoise and ive got like 
comforters vocnoise on the side of the bed vocnoise so cause hes like vocnoise hell 
like get out hes just like i dont wanna be in the bed with these 
guys and hell get on the floor and vocnoise hell sleep on the comforters on 
the floor but hes close and vocnoise hes happy that laughway laugh sil umhum iver 
umhum sil right there iver yeah that yeah sil umhum sil i think the mother 
has more of an instinct for that vocnoise but sil as far as the studies 
go where the people roll over their babies i dont see how you can roll 
over on sil anything that size and not know it sil unless you were on 
drugs or drunk or sil whatever sil you know what i mean sil vocnoise iver 
umhum iver umhum iver umhum sil yeah because i couldnt imagine rolling over on sil 
anything that was foreign in my bed and not knowing it it would wake me 
up sil especially i mean i think you vocnoise kind of have hesword sil different 
vocnoise level of awareness vocnoise when you are a mother and youre sleeping in a 
bed with your vocnoise infant vocnoise because vocnoise iver vocnoise iver umhum sil umhum sil 
laugh vocnoise sil vocnoise iver pretty well sil there iver vocnoise iver vocnoise i think 
it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention vocnoise sil and 
i think thats a little harder because he was an only child for vocnoise nearly 
five years sil so vocnoise its been an adjustment for him but he loves his 
baby brother sil its its really he he nurtures him too so sil its neat 
to watch iver vocnoise iver umhum iver umhum sil right and theyre in so much 
competition sil umhum iver well actually ive sil picked up a part time job just 
in the past month or two so vocnoise im vocnoise im working for a research 
firm vocnoise just for the convenience of the hours i i want to get back 
into the nursing field but vocnoise sil right now i just cant sil take that 
much time sil away sil because that would be least an eight hour shift and 
vocnoise i vocnoise dont sil think sil that were ready for that laughyet vocnoise hes 
a teacher sil umhum vocnoise he works at a high school yeah sil he teaches 
ninth and tenth graders laugh vocnoise no sil laughi dont think that at all laugh 
id be deceiving myself i think vocnoise i i guess when i sil i heard 
about him im just like oh my gosh i cant believe vocnoise all of the 
vocnoise sil the things that these kids are experiencing i didnt vocnoise know about sil 
whatever until i was much much older i didnt worry about that when i was 
that age and vocnoise its kind of scary iver i have no laughidea laugh iver 
umhum iver umhum sil umhum sil yeah vocnoise i guess my sil i guess what 
i would say sil mostly for that is that vocnoise the parents are too busy 
with their own careers vocnoise and they dont take time sil to raise their kids 
vocnoise and establish the morals vocnoise in the home vocnoise and theyre just like oh 
well theyll learn it sil there vocnoise whatever vocnoise and the kids sil um sil 
theyre sil basic sil where they learn things is their peers they dont get it 
sil everything instilled at home vocnoise thats pretty much sil what sil yknow ive vocnoise 
seen talking to my husband and vocnoise yknow and theres so many broken homes and 
single moms and trying to vocnoise trying to do it all and the kids are 
the ones that are suffering and having to vocnoise grow up before theyre ready iver 
umhum iver umhum sil but yeah iver umhum iver yeah vocnoise the media exposure laugh 
iver vocnoise i blame it on that yeah because yknow vocnoise sil theres been a 
lot more kids that have died in school vocnoise then yknow sil just recently i 
guess it wasnt in the biggin numbers at one time vocnoise but theres been random 
sil violence in schools yknow sil where kids would die even more than vocnoise yknow 
seven or whatever sil and i think that the medias just made it into something 
vocnoise that theyve glamorized it and some of the kids i think are screwed up 
anyway and theyre just like well hey yknow sil i can do that and ill 
be on the cutofftetv yeah sil i do i think thats a big part of 
that sil because they want sil their name known and they dont care if they 
die anyway vocnoise umhum sil umhum iver vocnoise sil umhum vocnoise yeah sil yeah sil 
its been glamorized and they dont sil they dont value sil human life either sil 
i dont think because theres so much violence sil yknow you cant sil watch tv 
and not seeing vocnoise somebody get shot or something sil and its just like its 
not really real vocnoise because its yknow you turn the channel and you see the 
same actor doing something else and youre like see it wasnt real and vocnoise i 
dont think they sil i think sil i dont know iver laugh iver umhum umhum 
iver umhum sil yeah because they think theyre grown sil they think theyre grown and 
theyre like sil twelve and thirteen and theyve been having sex since they were ten 
and vocnoise its just vocnoiselikegosh laughgosh vocnoise and you know how and theyre having babies 
earlier and earlier and sil its just really sil scary iver i think it should 
be the parents responsibility sil but i have no objection to them teaching it sil 
somewhat in the schools i guess iver umhum sil i dont know that they heswould 
use the laughinformation if they had it laugh laugh i i dont know iver umhum 
iver umhum iver i personally agree with that but thats just from my own moral 
beliefs and vocnoise everything but i dont know sil i i dont think that theres 
one solution thatll fit every sil every sil child and every situation vocnoise i mean 
my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so vocnoise yknow obviously his he 
said his dad told him about condoms yknow so sil theyre gonna make that decision 
on their own i say just sil and and plus with the internet and everything 
they sil they have access to so much information sil and i think that it 
falls back on the parents still sil if youre gonna be a parent you need 
to be laughresponsible vocnoise and i dont think that sil its getting done iver umhum 
iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver humum iver humum iver i dont i dont 
think so sil but iver umhum vocnoise i doubt it sil laugh iver laugh i 
think he needs counseling laughat that point laugh iver vocnoise iver hmm personally no i 
dont think so iver humum iver i had considered that yes iver i just vocnoise 
actually i was going to send my son to a heschristian kindergarten but i decided 
to home school instead so ive been home schooling him for kindergarten iver umhum vocnoise 
because i want his morals and cutoffhihis yknow sil his vocnoise basic stuff to come 
from me sil really vocnoise iver laugh yeah iver vocnoise sil umhum iver cutoffii sil 
exactly i wish i would have taken typing and home ec in high school vocnoise 
and i was too busy with college prep and vocnoise yknow what good did that 
do me laugh iver i iver exactly iver umhum vocnoise life skills laugh iver exactly 
laughhuge iver everybody needs to know that noise information vocnoise for credit cards iver yeah 
my husband was one of those iver were still working those laughproblemsout laugh vocnoise yeah 
iver and it stays with you for years laugh vocnoise they dont realize that nobody 
tells them until after the laughfact vocnoise iver umhum iver oh yeah vocnoise i have 
no idea laugh laugh iver i i hesword knew that kindergarten because its sil its 
not required in the state of ohio sil anyway they really arent required to be 
vocnoise in school or enrolled in anything until theyre six by september vocnoise when i 
found that out excludei was like oh ok cool vocnoise yknow cutoffyyou can keep them 
home i mean hes vocnoise he could probably go into the second grade i mean 
sil hes sil very bright he can read and write and vocnoise add and heshe 
he yknow hes sil so its a challenge for me laugh vocnoise iver vocnoise oh 
yeah laugh oh yeah sil were crazy laugh vocnoise iver hes an educator which is 
all the more reason to laughhomeschool vocnoise because he sees it and hes like sil 
yeah they iver get it from us so iver vocnoise iver vocnoise vocnoise i know 
vocnoise exactly sil right vocnoise ive seen some of the work from my husbands ninth 
and tenth graders because hes an english teacher vocnoise and sil i was appalled sil 
because they were writing at like a fourth or fifth grade level and theyre ninth 
and tenth graders vocnoise and i mean cutoffdidid sil just sil yknow even their manuscript 
and yknow just how they wrote and vocnoise sil vocnoisei was like wow laugh i 
couldnt believe it laugh vocnoise iver vocnoise iver noise iver umhum sil doesnt vocnoise thats 
a bunch of cutoffmmalarky laugh vocnoise thats just one of those myths laugh vocnoise i 
think thats sil to make people feel guilty or something iver but its not gonna 
work vocnoise i mean they sil if youre around sil people i mean number one 
theyre around vocnoise their parents and their siblings and thats socialization vocnoise you go to 
sil church or to the library or wherever i mean youre around people and youre 
around sil children and they get to vocnoise sil have socialization if you want to 
call it sil whatever vocnoise and vocnoise i think vocnoise from everything that ive read 
and seen vocnoise that um sil they get sil the socialization that they need at 
home and theyre not relying so much on their peers and their peers opinions vocnoise 
because hesi hesi for one example the pokemon craze vocnoise my son didnt know what 
pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it vocnoise and yknow its 
just like stuff like that vocnoise its just like they dont sil they dont know 
what vocnoise half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in 
their face yknow vocnoise and then even still theyre just like oh its cool because 
everybody else likes it they dont really know what sil it is or what sil 
its about or vocnoise i mean sil laugh yknow what i mean because its like 
vocnoise sil now they just blow up each other or whatever its like really what 
is the point to the whole thing and vocnoise sil he didnt know what it 
was until he heard some other kids talking about it oh it must be cool 
because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it wasnt 
cool vocnoise so that was my cutoffinfluinfluence our influence on him rather than the peers 
influence on him iver vocnoise umhum iver vocnoise right vocnoise exactly vocnoise vocnoise yeah laugh 
vocnoise sil it is and its not sil its vocnoise my house isnt as clean 
as i would like it to be but vocnoise yeah sil but thats just one 
vocnoise minor sil minor thing vocnoise and i feel like im just in a vocnoise 
sil kind of a hesphase phase if you will vocnoise its yknow because theyll be 
grown up sil in a blink of an eye vocnoise so if i vocnoise i 
mean if i put my career or whatever on hold vocnoise its gonna be worth 
it in the long run sil when my kids sil are grown up noise sil 
and they could be like yeah mom was there vocnoise they taught sil yknow mom 
and dad taught us sil yknow vocnoise sil all of our life application skills that 
we need to know now vocnoise sil and i think that sil thatll be better 
in the long run for them vocnoise sil and thats the responsibility i took on 
as being a parent so vocnoise sil thats my job laugh vocnoise even though it 
is mundane and laugh vocnoise monotonous at laughtimes iver laugh vocnoise sil yeah noise sil 
exactly vocnoise iver vocnoise iver oh youre just youre just a sil a homemaker vocnoise 
laugh vocnoise iver what do you do sit on the couch and watch tv and 
eat bon bons all day yknow its kind of iver vocnoise exactly vocnoise thats the 
thats the idea that people get they dont sil i dont think they realize vocnoise 
that how much laughwork it is vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah and its a challenge living 
on one income sil laugh thats why ive got a part time job now laugh 
iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver umhum iver exactly iver umhum sil iver umhum iver iver 
laugh vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise theyre laughconfused laugh vocnoise hesi i dont know that 
staying home is for everyone and i dont think parenting sil is for everyone vocnoise 
sil and it really makes me sad when i see somebody sil yknow vocnoise sil 
well we just want our kids sil because theyre only little once sil thats what 
i tell myself when i get really really frustrated vocnoise theyre only little once and 
they will be grown up before i know it laughbecause iver noise sil yeah because 
i mean five years went by like vocnoise laugh vocnoise iver yeah it was laugh 
iver yeah because i dont have a degree iver i went back and did a 
one year sil um schooling hesto sil get hesmy vocnoise nursing license i became an 
l p n sil so sil i dont have a degree my husband has a 
degree i put him sil through school vocnoise laugh laughi laughfinished vocnoise finished his private 
school vocnoise iver wittenberg iver no vocnoise iver eventually iver yeah sil well see where 
im at in five years vocnoise i know everybody is like well dont you want 
to go back for your r n im like sil after working with r ns 
and vocnoise we were doing the same things basically and they didnt get paid much 
more than i did so i was like well what a waste yknow vocnoise go 
to school vocnoise for nothing basically just to learn a few more theories vocnoise laugh 
laughi laughcould laughcome laughup laughwith laughmy laughown laugh iver just iver a little bit of 
both i think i vocnoise looked into some phonics i went to the library checked 
out some phonic tapes let him watch those cause vocnoise kids love to watch things 
laugh vocnoise and just reading with him and going over things and vocnoise its its 
been amazing just to see its like the light bulb comes on and iver yeah 
and he can sound out things and he can even spell things just from his 
own understanding of phonics and vocnoise yeah vocnoise ive i been pretty impressed im like 
wow you got that really really close to being the right spelling vocnoise laugh vocnoise 
iver just from what hes learned iver vocnoise well i mean most of it was 
me going over it with him vocnoise and just sil yknow i talked to some 
people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and 
sil yknow just vocnoise doing the things that work for him and as an individual 
iver id say we do oh at least an hour sil or more a day 
sil something like that iver vocnoise well i mean i wouldnt cutoffsesay i wouldnt say 
it was an hour at a time laugh vocnoise but yeah sil and he loves 
playing on the computer sil doing c d roms and laugh vocnoise loves watching the 
magic school bus iver so i vocnoise i try to gear what he watches sil 
towards educational sil programming instead of just sil junk laugh vocnoise iver vocnoise sil vocnoise 
iver no vocnoise iver well right now i think he knows enough im just letting 
him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things im pretty im 
like wow i cant even build the stuff that he built he makes ships and 
cars and vocnoise rockets an laugh vocnoise iver im cutoffaim im impressed im like ok 
i tried to build a car and it didnt look laughlike laughanything laugh vocnoise iver 
yeah so vocnoise iver laugh iver ah sil probably iver yeah sil nah because right 
now yknow because he knows how hesto hes hes learned vocnoise id say he knows 
more than most kindergarteners vocnoise so i dont even push anything we dont really have 
a set schedule right now and vocnoise im just letting him be creative and vocnoise 
yknow letting him help around the house and sil yknow just vocnoise if i let 
him watch something thats educational sil based usually vocnoise and i let him play on 
the computer sil well go to different websites sometimes to sil check out things and 
vocnoise im amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from sil day to 
day sil stuff sil and just listening because hes sil he listens to laugheverything laugh 
vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise he picks up toys hell vacuum he sil puts dishes 
in a dishwasher and vocnoise he can vocnoise um put clothes and take clothes out 
of a dryer and put clothes away iver yeah iver he cleans his vocnoise iver 
he cleans the toilet too because hes a boy and boys vocnoise even some men 
dont quite iver hit the mark sometimes so sil laugh laughhe laughgets laughto laughclean laughthe 
laughtoilet especially since most of that is his iver hesor sil i would say ninety 
sil nine ninety eight percent vocnoise laugh vocnoise iver because its hard being the only 
girl in the laughhouse laugh iver his mom was june cleaver iver laugh iver umhum 
iver laugh iver hum iver laugh iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum sil 
and then they end up okay anyway laugh vocnoise thats good laugh iver right iver 
yeah iver hed be lost iver vocnoise iver umhum iver laugh iver at the age 
of ten iver vocnoise i shouldnt be having to clean quite as much as laughi 
do now vocnoise ah mm id say by ten vocnoise they should be able to 
help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it 
by themself i know i did at then vocnoise and to be able to do 
sil their laundry sil maybe sil definitely vocnoise help out a lot around the house 
iver vocnoise iver no thanks laugh vocnoiseyoudecidewhatclassesweregonnabetaughtandyoucouldjuststartfromthegrounduplikeyoudontevenhavearequirementyoudontevenhavetoteachenglishclassesifyoudontwanttooryoudonthavetoteachmathclass umhum iver vocnoise i dont think i can 
answer that iver on the spur of the moment vocnoise id have to think about 
that i really would iver vocnoise id iver yeah i would sil id say cutoffssomething 
yknow life application sil things would definitely sil need to be part of it vocnoise 
i dont think that you should throw out english or math or vocnoise yknow sil 
cant believe im saying this history but laugh vocnoise i dont think you should throw 
out that stuff but i dont think that there should be as much emphasis on 
it vocnoise i think more of the cutoffemphamemphasis emphasis should be on vocnoise life skills 
and just being able to make it sil on youre own and take care of 
yourself and vocnoise but definitely i think that those other sil sil the three rs 
vocnoise yknow i think those are still very important iver because you do have to 
have a higher education sil most of the time to do anything vocnoise these days 
so vocnoise they definitely have to have their iver grounding at there so they can 
go forward iver i know i wish i knew how to sew laugh i can 
do buttons thats about it vocnoise laugh vocnoise vocnoise umhum iver yeah iver exactly iver 
umhum iver id say there would be certain life sil application things that all kids 
should know vocnoise but not vocnoise i dont think that you can say everything vocnoise 
yknow you have sil everybody has do this because vocnoise yknow people are individuals and 
you have to take that in to consideration i think so iver umhum iver umhum 
iver thats good iver unknown iver umhum iver iver vocnoise laugh iver umhum iver vocnoise 
i dont know vocnoise i dont know vocnoise laugh im sure it would happen because 
theres sil cutoffppeople all kinds of wacky people out there vocnoise laugh vocnoise seriously vocnoise 
i dont know sil i have the family members that are homosexual thats just my 
own personal sil thing beliefs sil i dont know i think thats vocnoise they shouldnt 
have taken it off of the sil d m s sil whatever it was laugh 
vocnoise i dont know iver umhum iver umhum iver somewhat iver umhum iver yeah iver 
oh yeah iver so hes gonna be hessomebody can complain about something vocnoise well thats 
another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes 
to cook vocnoise yknow exteverybody vocnoise most people know how to open a can of 
soup or something and boil water vocnoise make some toast but vocnoise yknow thats about 
sil all that they wanna do as far as it comes to cooking even if 
they do have to cook for their family not everybody vocnoise not every female likes 
to cook yknow they just do it because vocnoise yknow theyre supposed to or whatever 
and vocnoise i know some families where the men sil the cutoffhuhead the husband does 
all of the grocery shopping and all the cooking vocnoise and the wife does yknow 
whatever she does vocnoise i mean it vocnoise its individuality vocnoise again vocnoise so vocnoise 
iver yeah my dads a chauvinist pig vocnoise laughbut laughdoes laugh laughhe laughstill is vocnoise 
laugh iver laugh iver no sil laugh iver um probably not laugh iver vocnoise he 
thought it was great that i was going to school but iver but then he 
disowned me so it doesnt laughmatter laugh iver mm iver yeah sil laugh iver and 
i do have a brother iver by the way iver he didnt iver laugh iver 
laugh iver he works in a factory laugh vocnoise iver oh laugh iver vocnoise well 
um vocnoise i cutoffsuppose i suppose laugh well ive vocnoise sil i sil decided that 
i was going to date a black guy and my cutoffhushusband my dad didnt like 
that at all so he disowned me and sil so now heshe im married to 
my husband and vocnoise iver vocnoise my husband is black iver and laugh vocnoise and 
iver exactly iver because not only is he a chauvinist pig but hes a bigot 
laughtoo laugh vocnoise a racist extyeah so iver laugh vocnoise laugh iver umhum iver umhum 
iver really iver i didnt know that iver okay iver laugh vocnoise uhhuh iver umhum 
sil diversity iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver yeah because its the midwest yeah 
iver thats cool iver never vocnoise no sil he doesnt have anything sil he cutoffwwont 
he wont sil talk to me sil yet iver it is and it isnt because 
i vocnoise i extsee where he is and hes sil really messed up and sil 
i sil i cant do anything for him sil but ive yknow ive vocnoise im 
open to sil a relationship with him but right now vocnoise with his attitude the 
way it is id say that sil me and my family are better off not 
having him vocnoise stirring up a bunch of vocnoise conflict or whatever iver so iver 
laugh hes saw hes seen my oldest son when he was like two i was 
at my cousins wedding vocnoise my cousin invited me to his wedding and me and 
my son went that was before me and my husband got married thats another long 
story vocnoise he was three when we got married vocnoise laugh vocnoise and um vocnoise 
my cutoffhuhusband sil my dad threw fit iver yeah vocnoise like a little kid vocnoise 
and vocnoise really he he didnt say anything to me but he made my aunt 
feel like a little sil pile of dirt vocnoise his sister vocnoise and uh vocnoise 
so he just really vocnoise showed out that day vocnoise but whats so funny is 
sil our baby sil my dad has red hair vocnoise and our baby sil has 
red hair iver laugh so and he iver and he looks uh he looks more 
yknow like sil that side of the family vocnoise and sil i was cutoffjujust sil 
he he was born we couldnt believe it we didnt know there was redheads on 
my husbands side of the family vocnoise and then we found out that he had 
a great grandfather with red hair and blue eyes iver thats my dad has red 
hair and blue eyes so iver its just very comical i was just like uhoh 
iver noise vocnoise i said well god has a sense of laughhumor laugh laughwordthats what 
i said so vocnoise exti dont think the sagas over vocnoise vocnoise laugh vocnoise umhum 
iver uhhuh iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver umhum iver 
umhum iver umhum sil yeah iver um yeah iver right um vocnoise hesand and its 
sometimes that extopens um sil the person up because vocnoise a child theyre so innocent 
and you cant help but love them vocnoise and sil i know my mom had 
a big problem vocnoise with sil the whole inter racial iver thing at first but 
sil she sil my cutoffkikids she loves my kids vocnoise and she loves my husband 
iver now vocnoise and it was just taking her out of her you know where 
she vocnoise yknow you you grow up hearing those lies and iver yknow it just 
experiencing sil someone for who they are vocnoise and so shes vocnoise iver uh shes 
grown uh uh she yeah sil shes expanded her horizons if you will vocnoise and 
iver yeah iver no iver no they they divorced when i was like ten or 
something so vocnoise vocnoise i would say yes and no ive uh ive uh i 
feel pretty accepted vocnoise iver and sil yknow vocnoise just sometimes its just like theyre 
like oh well she couldnt understand or something like that but vocnoise for the most 
part i vocnoise theres sil yknow no weirdness vocnoise hes had he had a few 
cousins yknow make some little vocnoise comments but iver no nothing i mean his mom 
and his dad are cool and iver his brother and sister sil theyre fine iver 
vocnoise iver uh no vocnoise no iver my dads the only sil weird well vocnoise 
him and some of his brothers and sisters are vocnoise kind of out there too 
but laugh vocnoise iver umhum iver umhum iver em oh yeah iver umhum iver umhum 
iver umhum iver umhum iver yeah um iver yeah iver umhum iver right vocnoise thats 
good iver vocnoise yeah iver umhum iver umhum iver eh iver vocnoise iver as much 
probably vocnoise iver iver laugh vocnoise iver no the funniest thing though was with my 
husband and the sil laughchild because hes so cutoffffair vocnoise hes so fair vocnoise and 
he said in the hospital people were looking at him like vocnoise sil theres no 
way that could happen laugh he said that because yknow they take them off to 
hesweigh sil weigh him or whatever and i said you dont leave him vocnoise he 
said people were looking at him like iver who who iver yknow vocnoise somebody lied 
to you buddy he said they were just looking at him like sil yknow no 
way vocnoise laugh they were like sil no laugh vocnoise iver but laugh vocnoise iver 
ah okay iver umhum iver umhum iver laugh iver vocnoise oh yeah iver umhum iver

glasses for sil more for vocnoise sil yknow sil reading vocnoise i can see far 
away iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver i wish i could wear contacts iver no sil 
because i have a stigmatism vocnoise because i vocnoise sil yknow look sil glasses cut 
in right here and thats irritating iver laugh iver all right iver i wasnt born 
here but i was raised here iver and i was raised here most of my 
life iver i was a baby sil yknow sil under one laugh iver vocnoise i 
was born in brooklyn new york sil noise sil iver thats where my fathers from

iver he um traced freight whatever that means iver where the sil where they were 
going and sil and uh sil he worked in a trailer sil uh sil out 
in the yards sil yknow iver yeah sil yeah iver he so uh sil yeah 
he was strictly a union man sil yknow sil so sil he kept his vocnoise 
he believed in the unions vocnoise yknow sil so the railroaders was union yknow iver 
he always preached get a union job yknow iver vocnoise course they dont believe in 
the unions now like they used to iver yknow sil heswe we really dont know 
much about his life away cutoffffrom sil yknow sil away from home iver as far 
as what he did i sil im sure that he probably did go to meetings 
sil but uh as far as being a leader or something like that he i 
know i dont sil im sure he wasnt sil iver no sil he didnt sil 
he didnt sil iver we didnt know sil yknow anything about what he did or 
sil we found out more um after he died iver vocnoise twenty years ago iver 
when he died sil um sil i was about thirty iver he was only fifty 
six iver uh he had an anorism sil he had uh sil high blood pressure 
sil which we knew about sil and uh sil he started um sil vocnoise yknow 
not being himself so he went to the doctor and they vocnoise did some tests 
and found out he had this anorism that had to be operated on right away 
vocnoise and he died uh sil under the anesthetic of a heart attack sil um 
so sil it was very sudden and sil unexpected sil umhum iver right sil right 
iver umhum iver yeah iver laugh iver no iver i ended up uh sil running 
away from home vocnoise yeah iver i was a teenage run away iver no there 
was a lot of conflict at home sil um sil my dad uh sil had 
to support us uh there were four of us and our mother has disabilities sil 
and uh she was kind of sil crazy iver yknow not sil that im cutoffst 
talking negative about my mother vocnoise but she has um sil some uh neurological damage 
iver and uh a disease sil that affected her mind sil and of course yknow 
back then i didnt really sil know that but sil there was a lot of 
conflict iver um sil so uh sil thats what i did and i sil went 
to some uh sil foster homes and things like that sil vocnoise and uh sil 
lived in delaware for a while sil yknow got out of highschool and sil got 
married iver right sil umhum sil i never went back home iver yeah i did 
iver umhum sil when i would run away from foster homes iver yeah i did 
iver that was that was horrible iver yeah there was a lot of them and 
they were not very good iver sil laugh iver yeah right here in columbus sil 
in the short north vocnoise iver sil not too far from here iver umhum iver 
sil well that used to be where sil yknow all the teenage teenagers went iver 
i dont know if they still do sil that was a long time ago vocnoise 
sil thats always kind of been known for that sil yknow iver yeah vocnoise iver 
they go iver yeah iver laugh vocnoise yeah i dont know where theyre going now 
but sil iver sil i sil tried errorvoling sil volunteering sil yknow at excludename sil 
picking them up sil vocnoise sil doing a volunteer thing and id get calls all 
during the night to go pick these kids up sil vocnoise sil because i thought 
i was doing something to help but sil yknow sil youre not helping them iver 
this cutoffh iver these iver this sil these uh the excludename it has uh setup 
where um sil vocnoise sil they have safe places where kids can go when they 
run away noise sil and then sil its different businesses like white castle extor sil 
pizza sil one of the pizza places and sil uh sil some of the supermarkets 
and things and theyre advertised yknow sil throughout the community vocnoise sil so these kids 
when they have problems they sil might wanna go to huckleberry house and they dont 
have a way so they go to a safe house sil vocnoise and they call 
and they have a sil yknow group of volunteers would go out and pick these 
kids up vocnoise take them to huckleberry house sil which isnt far from here vocnoise 
sil so i did that for a while but uh vocnoise sil vocnoise sil wasnt 
very uh sil satisfying sil because i really didnt feel like they were doing anything 
to really help the kids vocnoise sil at huckleberry house iver well they only keep 
them there like for yknow a day or so sil and then they um sil 
try to sil intervene with their family sil put them back with their family sil 
or um sil maybe call in childrens sevices and i sil and i just really 
dont think much of childrens services so iver sil yknow i just got out of 
it iver sil iver umhum sil iver no sil vocnoise with the system iver sil 
vocnoise well sil vocnoise sil i think they need to do away with a lot 
of the foster homes sil uh sil cutoffmomost uh yknow a lot of the cutofffofoster 
yknow theres sil people with good intentions but sil vocnoise i just think that it 
just needs to be restructured totally different way sil and uh sil yknow maybe pull 
these kids uh sil into more of a group sil setting or something and give 
them more um sil yknow counseling uh professional sil yknow counseling sil vocnoise sil because 
its um sil yknow i i didnt have good experiences with vocnoise foster homes and 
sil and i know of a lot of kids sil yknow theyre saying that sil 
i think the parents have too many sil rights sil yknow in the courts sil 
and theres just a lot going on yknow that sil noise sil uh sil its 
not gonna get better its gonna get worse yknow with the way families are torn 
apart now sil and uh sil yknow sil mothers have to work and sil uh 
sil you just cant yknow stay home and be that uh sil yknow perfect mom 
vocnoise yknow sil so theres just a lot going on sil uh sil that needs 
to be restructured sil so iver the runaways vocnoise uh well vocnoise i think the 
youngest that i met was maybe exttwelve vocnoise but thats yknow still young iver i 
picked up one kid he sil he had been in uh sil he was only 
about sil vocnoise fifteen vocnoise he was adopted vocnoise and he ran away iver he 
was having problems with his adopted mother sil and he was in a sil an 
all unknown sil all night restaurant sil noise sil and he was bragging yknow that 
he met this man sil and the man took him home sil yknow and he 
slept at the mans place vocnoise and i was telling her do you know how 
dangerous that yknow that could have been for you sil and uh vocnoise he thought 
it was cool vocnoise yknow sil so yknow just things like that iver he was 
lucky iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise he was lucky noise so iver vocnoise excuse me sil 
vocnoise sil well sil typically what i observed is conflict yknow with mom sil most 
of the time sil uh sil well i think a lot of times when theres 
a stepfather involved yknow that becomes a problem for some of them sil but sil 
they said sil yknow you might run into a case where yknow the familys abusing 
sil uh sil the child sil yknow but i didnt run into that iver vocnoise 
iver really iver yeah iver umhum iver yeah go in there and find out yknow 
is the kid being abused if the kids being abused sil yknow take him out 
sil yknow forget the parents rights sil yknow sil or um sil yeah yknow if 
theyre using drugs put them somewhere yknow sil and get them yknow get them sil 
in rehab yknow keep them there sil yknow just dont sil throw them there for 
three days and then throw them out vocnoise its a lot of money being wasted 
on these kids being placed in these foster homes sil where nothings getting accomplished iver 
in a way yeah i think that would be good sil yeah sil maybe a 
new name iver yeah iver umhum sil yeah they had those back when i was 
a teen they wanted to send me to one of those sil my father wouldnt 
allow it sil because uh sil it was sil integrated iver um hum iver the 
court iver i had a social worker sil umhum sil hum i had a social 
worker um sil yknow the whole time sil they might sil yknow do things different 
now though but vocnoise youre supposed to have a caseworker iver i moved to louisville 
kentucky iver vocnoise iver i had one sil while i was there yeah sil i 
have two kids vocnoise twenty nine and twenty two sil theyre real good iver umhum 
sil well my twenty nine year old shes married sil and uh sil she has 
a child sil and shes hesexpecting shes expecting another one vocnoise shes a senior here 
at um sil o s u sil shell be graduating sil in june vocnoise and 
uh sil shes worked yknow really hard sil and my son hes uh sil hes 
a senior hes twenty two hes a senior here sil uh sil dont think hes 
gonna graduate in two thousand sil because hes a new senior sil he wants to 
go to law school sil he does uh real well in school sil hes uh 
sil like a honor honor honorary thing yknow sil but thats all um sil yknow 
on him he did it sil yknow iver no sil uh uh sil iver sil 
not at all laugh sil vocnoise sil hes always had very definite opinions of how 
his life should be iver okay sil and always uh made choices for himself sil 
but sil as far as motivated uh for school no sil he was always motivated 
toward a career sil yeah he grew up here sil umhum iver yeah he went 
to columbus public schools well sil yknow i or sil im vocnoise catholic and i 
went sil to catholic schools and so i tried that with both my kids catholic 
schools and um sil for couple years and sil so he was in uh catholic 
school a couple years but he got he got expelled vocnoise because hes uh sil 
a d h d sil iver sil okay sil so sil uh he got expelled 
from vocnoise catholic school for sil behavior sil problems iver no thats iver no thats 
one thing that uh yknow i found was really lacking here sil um sil for 
my son sil uh sil sil nobody ever sil yknow what they wanted me do 
was sil put him on ritalin sil and i didnt like him on ritalin i 
didnt like what it did to him iver uh it turned him into a zombie 
iver yeah i iver i mean im used to those uh boy like yknow vocnoise 
jumping all over the house and iver uh sil vocnoise yknow just always just sil 
active sil and hes always been very active in sports sil vocnoise but when i 
put him on the ritalin he was um sil laying on the couch yknow just 
sil zombied out iver iver yeah vocnoise iver vocnoise i didnt know yknow what the 
problem was and sil yknow i just kept having these problems with him so they 
told me i need take him the school said i need take him psychiatrist psychologist 
vocnoise and uh so i took him and sil she said do you think this 
is normal sil yknow because hes like vocnoise rolling off the extchair and vocnoise banging 
dolls together i cutoffssaid i dont know i said i got one brother sil i 
dont know how boys are supposed to be sil she says well this is not 
normal vocnoise sil im like okay sil vocnoise so uh i dont know i tried 
taking him to um sil psychologists sil they did like behavioral vocnoise therapy vocnoise sil 
i brought him here to ohio state and put him in a vocnoise an experiment 
sil uh he was in it for about three years sil working with a food 
supplement sil and uh sil it actually did sil real well for him sil vocnoise 
sil and the researcher extgave extme what he yknow cutoffuhits hesits like sort of like 
taking vitamins vocnoise he gave extme supplies of that even sil after the sil project 
was over vocnoise but then after there wasnt any more he couldnt give it to 
me and it cost too much sil noise sil for me to buy it iver 
ive never heard of it sil being developed commercially iver so sil uh sil he 
finally decided uh sil yknow after sil oh well when he was in catholic school 
they kept his sil vocnoise kept his sil desk in the hallway sil yknow iver 
yeah theyd just kick him to the hallway he was either vocnoise sil yknow sil 
in the hallway or in sil uh sil the office and and the nuns would 
say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivia 
questions iver noise that was grade school iver yknow the only thing that really really 
saved my son i think from getting into any kind of trouble or anything was 
he was so involved in sports iver umhum sil vocnoise so when he uh was 
a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking i gotta 
get it together what am i gonna do sil vocnoise so he uh sil agreed 
to go to psychiatrist and uh sil so he went on ritalin sil uh sil 
so he took the ritalin through his sil last sil of his junior year and 
his senior year vocnoise sil now hes on a medication they call uh wellbutrin sil 
vocnoise sil his doctor um sil doesnt believe in sil ritalin iver so sil he 
gives him a drug called wellbutrin sil which is a sil yknow sil like an 
antidepressant type thing that they said works for uh sil a d h d sil 
vocnoise sil but it really helped him yknow concentrate sil to be able to sil 
study iver oh yeah sil umhum iver yeah hes got energy sil yeah iver vocnoise 
laugh sil im sil saying that its not right for some people but sil yknow 
wasnt right for my son iver vocnoise it is noise sil yeah sil because pediatricians 
are able to dispense it and sil um sil vocnoise i just sil yknow felt 
like sil trying to avoid it as much as possible yknow growing up iver vocnoise 
see thats thats the difference uh worthington has a sil yknow program for them um 
sil one of the women that i worked with sil vocnoise sil she was having 
so many problems similar to mine sil and her cutoffclippingwordchchild son was in um columbus 
schools and sil vocnoise sil she moved to westerville and sil vocnoise put him in 
this class for that and sil it took care of it iver they dont have 
that sil for sil columbus schools iver i dont have a good opinion of sil 
uh columbus schools sil at all sil no not at all iver no i i 
i dont think so iver well its gotta come from the top vocnoise sil yknow 
i unknown i just found like there was just a total lack of interest in 
the student sil from every direction sil vocnoise so i would say yknow its an 
organizational sil problem with no yknow no motivation sil uh sil yknow to do their 
job sil vocnoise yknow properly vocnoise sil now sil i live down the street from 
what they call cahs its the columbus uh alternative sil high school sil and uh 
you get there through a lottery system sil vocnoise sil vocnoise and they have the 
best reputation of all the columbus schools sil vocnoise and uh those kids leave there 
getting full scholarships vocnoise uh my son went there one year sil uh sil uh 
sil vocnoise sil it was a disaster for him iver vocnoise sil but yknow vocnoise 
sil its a very cutoffclippingwordenenvironment sil and nonstructured environment sil which sil vocnoise my son 
wouldnt have worked sil in and then they dont have sports but vocnoise sil these 
kids get sil scholarships to some of the major colleges throughout the united states and 
were talking big money cutoffscholarshscholarships full scholarships vocnoise sil so if theyre able to do 
it there at that one school sil vocnoise sil yknow they could iver they could 
do it vocnoise sil my sil granddaughter my one granddaughter vocnoise uh sil vocnoise sil 
they live in springfield they just moved to springfield and she goes to sil vocnoise 
sil kindergarten sil only a half day sil vocnoise sil and this child is only 
uh five years old sil vocnoise sil uh he has them reading the newspaper sil 
watching the news sil she told me a story about cutoffcolcolumbus christopher columbus um discovering 
america that was so sil deep and intense sil vocnoise couldnt believe it was coming 
from a five year old vocnoise sil so this is what the teacher is doing 
down there iver and she wouldnt have learned that a whole day kindergarten here iver 
vocnoise well i would say in springfield yeah iver vocnoise sil i cant say yknow 
i cant say that its an cutoffexexpectation sil expectation hesword i i still say it 
has to come from the top down iver uh sil youve gotta have the leadership 
sil uh youve gotta have the right people sil uh sil to have this sil 
school structured sil properly sil and the yknow the people with the right credentials sil 
uh for the job sil yknow sil and uh sil im telling you sil some 
of these principals sil that sil vocnoise uh sil that ive dealt with noise sil 
uh were highly overpaid sil as far as i was concerned for what they were 
doing sil vocnoise sil um sil yknow one cutoffgahguy vocnoise one principal that sil from 
my um daughters high school sil vocnoise sil he was out partying all the time 
they sil yknow they sil he was cutoffcomecoming he was riding around in a corvette 
sil vocnoise sil and uh he tried to take me out iver vocnoise and he 
was always like really red faced and the kids would say yknow he went out 
at lunch and got drunk and came back sil vocnoise and that was one of 
the better schools sil in columbus vocnoise sil and sil yknow i just saw a 
lot of that i just saw a lot of um sil uh principals driving big 
fabulous cars and iver not doing anything sil vocnoise sil my sil son uh sil 
vocnoise sil yknow with his disorder sil vocnoise sil he would constantly be uh sil 
late sil noise sil for school sil vocnoise sil and i uh sil called the 
school sil and told them sil this was in high school that i wanted them 
to file charges on him sil and sil they said well no uh sil hes 
not sil met the criteria sil i said well he doesnt get to school sometimes 
until lunchtime laugh sil they said well he gets here just sil in time sil 
to not be counted sil um sil tardy or not tardy but iver absent for 
the whole day sil which would cutoffcoconsidered be considered truant sil so they said i 
well i had to do was go down to juvenile sil to this certain gentleman 
sil in juvenile and have him file charges sil so i took my son down 
to him sil and he said sil it was the school sil should have did 
that vocnoise so in the meantime hes telling me sil vocnoise that my sons in 
getting ready to go eleventh grade sil and sil neither sides gonna do anything about 
it vocnoise somebody shouldve did something about that because sil then yknow they would have 
been doing what they were supposed to do to sil make him sil yknow sil 
get in line sil and uh sil so he knew he could get by with 
it iver he iver unknown thats goes with the disorder they know sil vocnoise they 
know when vocnoise whos button to push and when not to push a button and 
how far they can go and sil yknow where the line is and they sil 
push you sil always sil thats why teachers sil they uh they drive the teacher 
up the wall iver yknow my daughter yknow there was just a lot of stuff 
when she was in high school and id call up to the school and sil 
yknow the principal like sil hes hed say miss excludename yknow im vocnoise sil i 
am her sil last chance sil yknow sil my daughter was going to summer school 
sil every summer sil and hes like mrs excludename yknow vocnoise shes like sil yknow 
sil the average student sil uh sil shes the type yknow that shes gonna get 
sil yknow shes got gonna get through college yknow shes just one of those sil 
yknow that just moves right along yknow shes not the brightest yknow but vocnoise shes 
bright enough and vocnoise those are your average professional people out working today sil and 
i was just like well i just want more help for my daughter yknow i 
just want vocnoise somebody to sil yknow jerk her down iver sil but they wouldnt 
yknow because my daughter was like um sil real bubbly outgoing sil yknow people person 
sil and she got by with so much sil at school sil and shes yknow 
worked its worked out fine with her laugh sil vocnoise with both of them actually 
sil iver well her major is communications sil it didnt start out that but sil 
my daughter wants to write books sil okay sil well vocnoise laugh iver in the 
meantime yknow vocnoise laugh you gotta pay the bills sil so sil i yknow im 
not sure what she wants to do sil shes had so many different kinds of 
jobs part time jobs though sil hum sil yknow sil im sil when she was 
younger like ten years ago she wanted to have her own talk show iver yeah 
sil so iver i dont know shes getting a second child now its getting a 
little harder laugh iver yknow iver i do hope that she does she is a 
good writer sil i do hope that cutoffssomeday yknow someday she can sil be able 
to do that iver yeah sil she just likes to write stories and shes real 
creative that way iver and the baby is due may thirtieth and graduation is june 
second iver so however this works out yknow sil i dont know im just im 
just sil like okay sil she just does i just want to get it over 
with sil and see now she yknow iver yeah iver she just wants to get 
it over with vocnoise iver yeah sil so sil she said shes gonna be catching 
the disability bus out here yknow after a certain amount of time vocnoise shes gonna 
ride that bus iver is it sil oh thats a good day iver yeah vocnoise 
vocnoise course yknow babies tend not to be on sil on time so iver yeah 
sil my kids were both two sil two weeks late so i know how it 
is laugh sil laugh iver yeah sil iver laugh iver its its interesting too because 
when she had her other child sil uh sil her she had made arrange she 
was at uh otterbein then sil she made arrangements that uh sil she might have 
to be in the hospital taking a final sil with one of her teachers sil 
so that baby was born in march sil so sil i think she got the 
finals right in or cutoffssomething yknow sil its just too much stress for me to 
even think about laugh vocnoise sil laugh iver laugh sil so thats why shes trying 
to get it out of the way now because yknow the sil the sil the 
husband he makes sil yknow fairly decent money sil so sil yknow she doesnt have 
to work right now sil but in order for them to move up the way 
they want to move up yknow sil after the baby comes she will need to 
work sil i have custody of another grandchild sil uh my son sil when he 
was in high school had a sil girl vocnoise no a little girlfriend and sil 
she was uh sil see he was tenth grade and she was ninth grade i 
guess sil she uh sil had a baby sil and uh sil believe my son 
was in eleventh grade when the baby was born sil and uh she had a 
lot of problems running away from home and sil uh sil shes uh vocnoise yknow 
well my son left to move into the dorm sil here at o s u 
sil and she uh sil moved in with me i think the baby was fifteen 
months old and sil i tried to help the young lady and sil it just 
turned out that the yknow the young lady was not ready to be a mother 
sil my son wouldnt sil even now isnt ready to be a father sil so 
uh sil there was a sil yknow whole investigation sil through childrens services sil and 
uh sil they gave me custody of the child sil temporarily sil and vocnoise shes 
still there and shes four and a half sil vocnoise sil the mothers married sil 
and has another child now and and the sil the little ones still with me 
iver she hasnt tried to get her daughter back sil she has sil visitation with 
her sil vocnoise sil i love her very very much yknow that way emotionally but 
sil boy id like for her mom to take her back sil yeah sil yknow 
im fortunate because i got a grant for her through the sil y uh m 
c a sil at a very nice um sil learning center sil that she goes 
to everyday sil so sil yknow course a lot of that yknow hinges on the 
fact that my son is a student and theyre very pro education yknow sil vocnoise 
sil so my son hes back home now but i wish he would go too 
sil laugh sil he just joined this fraternity iver oh my gosh sil it was 
a vocnoise it was it was just sil unbelievable sil he got really sick after 
that rush week sil yeah really sick sil so they want him to move in 
the fraternity house he cant really afford it sil but they just sent me a 
really nice letter saying hes like in the top of their chapter academically and everything 
so sil im thinking they might help him out a little bit they want him 
in the house real bad iver yeah sil iver yeah sil i i was really 
glad that my son uh met yknow was introduced to them or brought in or 
whatever they do because sil uh sil yknow the guys are real real nice sil 
yknow sil very sil its very yknow hes always kind of been like real stand 
off ish sil when it comes to sil yknow hooking up real sil tight with 
guys but he really likes these guys vocnoise yknow hooking up real tight with guys 
but he really likes these guys sil iver sil iver sil iver well sil um 
f sil noise sil see he sil moved into an apartment over on eleventh avenue 
sil iver sil vocnoise sil and it got broken into sil and uh sil yknow 
sil hes paying rent on this apartment and hes back home sil because the police 
said that this vocnoise apartment has been hit sil many times sil so its just 
a big mess right now yknow sil heshe had uh sil vocnoise uh sil nice 
uh cutoffje yknow his better clothes stolen his jewel noise yknow sil jewelry vocnoise um 
few other sil minor things but he didnt want his tv and v c r 
and sil those kind of things to get stolen so he moved them back home 
and vocnoise then he started worrying about something else and that moves back vocnoise then 
hes worried about his car because somebody down the street got their car stolen sil 
so its just uh gonna be a matter hesof rearranging sil hes sil um vocnoise 
applying for another scholarship he gets some already sil so if he would get this 
other scholarship i think it uh would help him uh sil be able to sil 
move into the fraternity sil uh i think he can get out of the apartment 
by cutoffsublease sil subleasing it sil he has to get the seventy five dollars to 
give to the landlord to sil they charge seventy five to do that sil to 
sil advertise sil and um sil vocnoise screen sil iver yknow do the screening iver 
yeah iver vocnoise oh sil boy theyre just really fun people to deal with iver 
sil vocnoise they had a two by four on the door sil for over a 
month noise iver nailed over it sil instead of sil replacing the door noise sil 
so iver yeah iver vocnoise sil company and they they uh sil vocnoise sil theyre 
the biggest landlord on campus i believe iver laugh iver yeah sil so yknow his 
friend lives on the other side yknow its like a duplex and his friend lived 
on the other side and he uh sil he also was uh sil broken into 
sil they sil came through his bathroom window iver yknow the police said that theyve 
been there many times sil iver sil vocnoise yknow but yknow kids they have to 
learn these things on their own i mean hes twenty two i still consider him 
a kid sil but sil they have to learn these things on their own yknow 
when you go to look for apartment what you need to look for and what 
you need to check out vocnoise yknow sil are you going to be able to 
afford it and sil everything that goes with it sil and have a work study 
job sil laugh yknow vocnoise iver umhum sil iver he wants to yeah iver yeah 
sil well he thinks he can do it iver yeah vocnoise iver yeah iver its 
a lot of money sil iver but my son he just hes so uh sil 
i mean i dont know if sil youve ever met anybody thats totally into politics 
sil sil iver have you ever met somebody like that and iver yeah vocnoise hes 
like that sil uh iver he wanted to sil but uh iver something in his 
schedule interfered with it iver umhum iver yeah ive cutoffalways i hesi think because my 
dad was iver no i dont work sil for politics iver no vocnoise sil no 
im im interested iver sil yeah what goes on in the community iver uh sil 
cutoffwhat goes on uh hesyou yknow nationally sil yknow sil vocnoise sil especially interested in 
this presidential sil election iver vocnoise sil well i thought it went the way it 
was supposed to go laugh iver yeah iver yeah uh somebodys gotta get sil k 
get sil yknow sil put george bush to the back sil iver sil iver im 
an independent iver i sil i dont like w sil i i dont i dont 
sil i mean i sil my uh i guess sil my uh sil mom was 
a democrat and my dad was a republican iver and uh sil maybe thats why 
yknow its like that but iver vocnoise sil vocnoise sil historically yknow my dads people 
sil were democrats sil but then they turned republican because they thought they were supposed 
to turn republican i guess sil but uh sil yknow theres theres some of vocnoise 
sil the conservative values that are very important to me yknow but then theres some 
social things that are real important too so iver umhum sil and some sil conservative 
vocnoise sil values too yknow that the republicans are supposed to sil represent but i 
dont think they sil they are doing a very good job of that sil laugh 
sil iver you can be an independent iver yeah sil but ive cutoffnever sil ive 
never voted in the primary my son said that uh sil i need to but 
sil im not real interested in voting in the primary iver yeah i could iver 
iver have you ever heard him speak iver vocnoise iver hes like this robot sil 
iver yknow sil every time you they ask him a question its like its been 
scripted and vocnoise its over and over sil and um sil he doesnt seem like 
hes real bright iver and i sil vocnoise i really feel like if youre gonna 
run for president of the united states you ought to be smart sil iver really 
smart sil bill clinton is smart and i sil i dont like clinton but hes 
really smart vocnoise and gore seems to be really smart sil bradley seems to be 
smart vocnoise and mccain maybe maybe not so smart but sil hes smart enough sil 
hes sil exper sil experienced politician too sil but uh sil yknow gore you just 
kind of look at that and say well uh sil yknow the republicans are desperate 
yknow sil vocnoise sil iver yeah sil yeah sil iver sil so they knew that 
this bush sil name would bring out a lot of money sil which it has 
sil hes got a lot of money to work with sil and yknow that doesnt 
seem fair either sil i dont think yknow the average sil person in sil united 
states the average person sil uh doesnt think that your politicians should be bought sil 
yknow iver not necessarily sil but yknow id like him to sil beat a candidate 
iver right sil anything anybody but that bush iver iver cutoffyeah laugh vocnoise sil and 
i sure dont want to vote for al gore iver sil yknow its terrible sil 
iver you dont have too many options yknow iver yeah sil yeah sil they say 
its gonna be hard to do in some of the other states but i dont 
think so iver against him in a lot of ways iver uh sil well my 
son he worked on the coleman campaign vocnoise so of course uh yknow i had 
to get out and yknow help him put the signs out and all that kind 
of stuff i got the bumper sticker sil got some people in my family some 
bumper stickers neighbor sil but um sil i was vocnoise sil i sil i was 
interested in uh seeing sil uh coleman be elected yes sil because sil uh excludename 
vocnoise sil vocnoise shes a republican sil vocnoise uh i used to work with excludename 
vocnoise sil iver sil not directly but indirectly so sil i sil certainly didnt want 
excludename to be elected sil vocnoise iver she was the rudest woman sil iver yeah 
i would she was like a sil uh sil community sil liaison sil uh with 
our corporation vocnoise so sil i was a supervisor sil on my job and sometimes 
i would have very very vocnoise difficult sil uh sil vocnoise clients vocnoise that i 
need advice sil from her on how to sil yknow go about sil working with

stay there that a seemed to be the big issue yknow with sil northland mall 
iver vocnoise but uh vocnoise sil yknow i knew that uh vocnoise sil vocnoise theyd 
already made that promise sil vocnoise and theres a lot of sil businesses sil that 
could move out of that area vocnoise sil yknow and half those taxes come to 
columbus sil even if a business is in westerville sil half the cutofftaktax sil the 
employees tax are going to um sil westerville and half are coming columbus iver sil 
yeah vocnoise sil extso vocnoise sil noise sil um sil vocnoise sil yknow i felt 
like yknow sil the polaris mall sil would sil benefit sil columbus sil and um 
sil vocnoise sil all all the way around yknow sil uh as far as uh 
sil vocnoise yknow what was going on with that jacobs coming here and running all 
that advertising about northland mall and everything sil um sil vocnoise i can understand yknow 
the residents of northland sil uh vocnoise sil wanting their mall to remain but i 
didnt feel like yknow that had anything do with polaris being built sil iver see 
i live close to iver sil uh vocnoise sil that would be the closest mall 
to me is northland sil its convenient for me iver vocnoise but uh vocnoise sil 
then theres a lot vocnoise sil yknow that they could do with that mall too 
sil that sil might make me even cutoffgagonna wanna go there more vocnoise iver if

smaller sil stores yknow like victoria secrets and sil vocnoise sil bookstores and toy stores

thing when really its just they treat you the exact same way sil like i 
dont know sil yeah sil i think thats true and like i lived in the 
dorms too and i really i really didnt like that like vocnoise it was like 
i dont know it was like vocnoise living in a hotel or something it was 
really weird sil and like noise iver vocnoise like just like sil noise sil like 
sil communal showers and stuff and like sil um sil noise sil just how its 
like sil one room that you like sil kind of live in or whatever yknow 
its more like like the army or something yknow like real vocnoise everythings real simple 
and everythings uniform and like sil i dont know iver yeah sil iver umhum sil 
noise sil yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to 
class and sil and like sil and then i just like ended up withdrawing because

living with my friend sil for awhile vocnoise vocnoiseum sil but sil and then like 
sil vocnoise now me and her and sil my other friend live in sil down 
on maynard iver umhum sil yeah like i knew sil vocnoise uh like a lot 
of people vocnoise who live down on campus i used to live down on hudson 
sil like over the summer before i went to o s u sil um sil

is different than campus sil yeah sil iver no about vocnoise about same age iver 
sil well my one friend went to sil vocnoise school in philadelphia for a while 
sil vocnoise but she didnt sil she went to a sil like a sil university 
arts which is a sil like a theater sil school and uh vocnoise it was 
real uh sil like intense or whatever yknow its like double the vocnoise sil the 
sil workload of sil of a vocnoise normal college vocnoise so she didnt like that 
so she came back and was kind of in the hessituation same situation that i 
was like vocnoise sil not really knowing what to do or whatever vocnoise and then 
sil my one friend vocnoise who were living with like he sil he sil he 
goes here he likes it i guess sil like sil i dont know sil iver 
sil first year yeah sil second quarter sil iver umhum vocnoise yeah iver yeah laugh 
iver well like sil um sil i sil i knew sil vocnoise one of my

they did plays together like down at like columbus junior theater or something and like 
thats sil so like sil um sil thats how we got introduced or whatever and 
then just been friends for a while sil couple a sil couple years sil yeah 
iver sil yeah well like sil i mean high school high sil schools always been 
really easy and like sil and sil like high schools really easy like i never 
really felt like sil challenged even remotely by anything sil like sil vocnoise and so 
like sil high schools kind of like a joke and it was real sil fun 
and everything yknow just to like sil not really have to do pretty much of 
anything yknow sil and like sil um sil and like so college was a vocnoise 
a little bit different i mean it was like a little bit more challenging i 
mean its basically the same thing in high school you just have less time to 
do the material yknow sil so its just like sil as opposed to having sil 
three weeks to doing a paper and doing it the night before you have three 
days to do it and you still do it the night before sil its just 
like sil i sil dont know i sil thought i just kind of like found 
out like that sil i really dont like school and like ever wanna go back 
and like having to take vocnoise having to take math noiseclasses again like i just 
was sil like sil vocnoise isnt really my sil thing like when sil too like 
sil i sil always knew that this it would be like this you always have 
to take basic classes but like i was a history major sil and so vocnoise 
its like vocnoise i dont care about math at all and like sil anything that 
i would do would be humanities or like sil so its like vocnoise iver like 
iver sil yeah well like i i played music and stuff sil with a lot 
of my friends i dont know basically just like sil standard teenage sil stuff sitting 
around watching tv sil and like sil i dont know sil just sil running around 
or whatever sil but like sil um sil yeah high school was always just real 
like sil like sil yknow sil you put in like a tiny little bit of 
effort and you get like a b and thats a vocnoise thats good enough i 
guess iver yeah its iver sil like its okay i mean its like a country 
school which was always real weird too i was always like sil me and like 
my friends were always like the vocnoise because i used to have real long hair 
sil and so that was like sil i used to be like a big hippie 
or whatever and like sil um sil that was sil i guess sil weird kind 
of like sil being sil the odd people in a in a small like vocnoise 
in a small midwestern farming sil school it is kind of odd i guess sil 
um sil i dont know sil um iver sil yeah sil yeah sil it was 
just like there was a lot of people sil there who yknow like their parents 
were farmers and or sil they they sil were whatever you sil know it was 
sil like vocnoise like vocnoise preppy kids or like sil hick sil type kids you 
know who sil iver yeah iver yeah sil i mean there was like a there 
was like sil a sil lot of kids who were who sil were sil different 
but just like sil not sil the majority or whatever iver laughyeah iver like sil 
not really i mean i sil played we played with friends we never played anywhere 
just fooling around like sil in peoples sil basements and stuff like sil never really 
sil organized enough sil to sil try and sil play anywhere sil really sil guitar

rock star oriented and stuff its more its more just like kind of a serious 
sil type sil type thing but sil but but sil not so like glam and 
vocnoise sil like fame oriented and stuff sil iver sil yeah its not like vocnoise 
there is a face behind like the music but not so much too yknow its 
not like vocnoise uh like because theres not like unknown like a vocnoise a like 
a defined lead vocnoise lead person because just one person doing it most of the 
vocnoise most of time i mean like vocnoise people do vocnoise have groups that play 
like sil techno beat vocnoise oriented music but its not like vocnoise a lead singer 
who like vocnoise yknow is like that its not like that at all iver yeah 
vocnoise i mean its like vocnoise its known but its in a different way its 
like a different type of fame than like vocnoise traditional style so sil its like 
more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like sil 
like its more of like a sil vocnoise its not like an m t v 
vocnoise type thing yknow iver sil like vocnoise i dont know vocnoise its like its 
vocnoise its really serious and its really not serious like vocnoise its vocnoise its everything

its vocnoise i dont vocnoise i dont know vocnoise i dont vocnoise i dont really 
go on the internet all that much vocnoise like vocnoise i dont know vocnoise iver 
yeah iver yeah well like um iver like iver my dad like iver went iver 
to florida and i was with him there for a little while vocnoise and iver 
then i iver um vocnoise he moved to texas because like he was moving into 
like the he was going to s m u there vocnoise and like vocnoise so 
i moved vocnoise back vocnoise from florida back to up vocnoise up here because i 
didnt wanna i didnt wanna go with unknown because texas is terrible vocnoise and like 
vocnoise um sil so vocnoise then like my mom vocnoise see like vocnoise my parents 
got divorced when i was like five or something vocnoise and so noise iver vocnoise 
um iver i was living with my mom vocnoise and vocnoise like half and half 
like vocnoise joint custody or whatever i was living with my mom vocnoise half with 
my dad and then when my dad moved to florida i moved with him vocnoise 
and then vocnoise uh my mom ended up vocnoise getting remarried and like my dad 
have remarried by that vocnoise time too vocnoise and vocnoise my mom vocnoise remarried vocnoise 
and vocnoise and they lived vocnoise moved out to sunbury and vocnoise like vocnoise this 
house on five acres or whatever and so vocnoise then vocnoise um vocnoise when i 
came back i just vocnoise lived with her vocnoise sil up there sil iver yeah 
iver sil hesuh sil think when i was five sil because it was like vocnoise 
yeah vocnoise yeah i dont really cutoffreremember remember them being really together iver like sil 
ever sil but sil i dont know it was real weird i vocnoise iver um 
vocnoise i dont know i mean vocnoise i vocnoise i like florida just because its 
not cold vocnoise and its vocnoise its really nice but it rains a lot i 
mean vocnoise and i vocnoise i mean i sil id rather live out vocnoise west 
because its like a dry heat as opposed to being vocnoise i mean its nice 
that its sil ninety degrees but its not nice that its like ninety percent humidity 
i mean vocnoise thats kind of unknown kind of sucks but vocnoise um vocnoise its 
just different to live in florida and how you think of florida vocnoise being is 
real different like vocnoise um vocnoise i like it because vocnoise kind of vocnoise the 
drivers arent so insane like they are here vocnoise like people are a little bit 
more laid back just because like vocnoise um sil i know in parts it is 
really insane but like sil sometimes just people would just like vocnoise because its all 
vocnoise because its nice weather people dont get so like aggravated by like here its 
like cold and and grey and you just wanna like vocnoise yell at people in 
your car and stuff or something i dont know i dont know if peoples deal 
is iver um vocnoise but vocnoise yeah i dont know sil yeah vocnoise i think 
its like theres like a real like sil either its its old people who are 
there vocnoise retiring or whatever vocnoise or its vocnoise more of like a younger sil 
people there sil i dont know sil you dont see a lot i dont know 
there is middle aged people there but its not so apparent like sil as here 
i guess iver yeah thats what it seems i mean vocnoise i know its like 
sil i mean its the same proportions i mean there are more old people there 
but vocnoise just seems more apparent just because of how vocnoise but you can like 
go outside all the time vocnoise yknow i mean theres never sil like three or 
four months where you just wanna sil sit in your house and vocnoise iver sil 
um vocnoise i was in more north florida vocnoise around tallahassee sil so thats a 
thats a little different i mean thats sil thats vocnoise not vocnoise thats more southern 
georgia basically vocnoise um sil i dont know i mean sil yeah its not so 
touristy sil and they had they had the thing where vocnoise you couldnt have any 
buildings bigger than the state capital because they didnt want it to be like orlando 
or miami like miami especially vocnoise so that was really interesting it was vocnoise a 
different type of town vocnoise like not not so many palm trees more big vocnoise 
oak trees and stuff like that vocnoise sil yeah sil its real sil its more 
sil not all of a centralized downtown its more of a vocnoise sil like spreading 
out iver iver yeah sil its a lot smaller than columbus though iver vocnoise i 
think vocnoise columbus is really interesting how it how it cutoffdedevelops develops compared to vocnoise 
like vocnoise i dont know just sil like how cutoffindianapolis like how columbus is different 
vocnoise it is a vocnoise a real standard midwest city just how its vocnoise designed 
and laid out compared to like philadelphia yknow or uh just vocnoise like when it 
was settled and and sil when it was made vocnoise just how like vocnoise more 
of the streets are more its all vocnoise like sil planned out more as opposed 
to like in vocnoise in philly vocnoise or places like that more east coast its 
like sil the roads vocnoise parts of them are real small and like vocnoise and 
other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff vocnoise and vocnoise so thats 
kind of interesting i mean vocnoise i think sil its also odd like the urban 
sprawl of columbus how vocnoise it um sil vocnoise just the suburbs develop and how 
its like more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized sil area thats 
really big like our vocnoise like sil columbuss downtown vocnoise its really odd too vocnoise 
i mean vocnoise theres nothing to do down there unknown its all sil businesses and 
like the couple shops that are down there close at like six i mean theres 
like sil couple restaurants or something sil but vocnoise i mean its its different when 
you think of other cities yknow its more of like a downtown is where you 
go to hang out but here its like campus vocnoise unknown or more of hesa 
vocnoise like you hang out like sil i dont know its more of like a 
cutoffsubsuburban like a suburban sil town as opposed to like a centralized downtown vocnoise yeah 
sil its sil just sil like vocnoise sil yknow like a half an hour or 
sil uh sil or i mean in cutofftwetwenty twenty minutes outside yknow you can get 
to dublin or fifteen minutes to dublin or something like that yknow i mean thats 
still like a part of sil of columbus as opposed to sil yeah iver yeah 
vocnoise not really i mean sil i go to vocnoise like vocnoise i go to 
this club axis sometimes vocnoise i mean thats short north whatever vocnoise like its okay 
vocnoise um vocnoise like sil i dont know i mean the red zones downtown or 
whatever i dont go to that i really dont like that place but um sil 
i dont know sil uh sil kind of the winter months really kill like doing 
anything like really any like foot traffic type things vocnoise i mean in the summer 
vocnoise it seems like it seems vocnoise in the winter it seems theres more iver 
uh vocnoise that like you have to do something like its more of uh uh 
this big precession to do anything yknow you have to put on like vocnoise all 
of these coats where more in the summer you can just walk in and out 
of your house and like sil go unknown go to the park and sit and 
its fine but like vocnoise here yknow you get sil slush everywhere and you got 
to think of so something to do you just cant like drive around and waste 
time because its vocnoise because its miserable iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise sil laugh iver yeah 
sil i i did vocnoise sil telemarketing for a while but thats thats vocnoise thats 
terrible people yeah i got tired of people yelling at me and like vocnoise you 
interrupted my dinner and blah blah blah vocnoise and like sil vocnoise but it was 
okay because the place i worked at didnt monitor our calls sil so you just 
yell at them and youd just be like i dont care vocnoise like iver im 
glad i interrupted your dinner fine unknown whatever vocnoise like vocnoise some people would be 
really nice um vocnoise sil and other people would vocnoise just be unbelievably rude its 
so funny vocnoise um vocnoise but vocnoise now i do this sil this uh vocnoise 
sil work at this place called excludename sil i work there with sil excludename works 
there too so vocnoise i mean excludename worked at the telemarketing place too sil with 
me so vocnoise it makes it bearable vocnoise uh vocnoise like it just vocnoise sil 
because i worked there for a while before she did and it was just it 
was really annoying vocnoise like sil um vocnoise but sil both places its cubicles yknow 
and thats really weird too laugh um vocnoise cubicles are vocnoise odd how that develops 
iver laughyeah iver i dont know iver yeah and like a vocnoise keyboard and vocnoise 
like this phone vocnoise you put on a headset and noise sil and vocnoise unknown 
vocnoise excludename okay i mean people call in and vocnoise um iver vocnoise its like 
a mail order catalog thing sil and vocnoise um vocnoise so vocnoise i dont know 
people are really really incompetent its really funny vocnoise like because some people vocnoise um 
sil i dont know how vocnoise they have like sil even vocnoise some people who 
sil cant speak english even well enough i dont know how they got signed up 
or how they even have a credit card to order vocnoise i mean vocnoise and 
too you can tell especially when vocnoise because people call from all over its really 
funny to talk to people from sil alabama or south carolina like i never knew 
people from south carolina had such thick vocnoise accents vocnoise like i never really thought 
of vocnoise sil north carolina and south carolina being vocnoise really southern vocnoise even though 
vocnoise i mean vocnoise they seceded first yknow i i mean cutoffeht vocnoise cutoffehthat i 
just cutoffassuassumed sil just sil thats different i always thought that more being east coast 
as opposed to so southern vocnoise and man theres people there who i vocnoise cant 
even understand what theyre saying vocnoise sil and sil noise like i dont know especially 
too vocnoise how sil unknown all like you have to give sil numbers and all 
the numbers and stuff and type it in real fast people go unbelievably fast when 
they say like vocnoise a ten string number and then they get mad at you

eight sil that would be better because then its like vocnoise i mean im more 
vocnoise cutoffsstaying vocnoise toned to staying up late anyway just because of like sil noise 
sil how it is or whatever but like vocnoise i dont want to have to 
get up really early either like i could never imagine having a nine to five 
job like that be horrible iver vocnoise sil have to go to bed so early 
sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil iver yeah vocnoise sil iver sil noise sil iver its 
okay iver i dont know like i think cutoffhihigh sil i think uh high school 
in general like they i people always talk about raising the standards you know vocnoise 
sil for high vocnoise extfor high school things but sil um sil noise vocnoise i 
think sil um sil vocnoise its kind of like vocnoise sil its vocnoise sil vocnoise 
sil its really hard vocnoise to to vocnoise sil like ive thought about before just 
whats sil vocnoise wrong with like the education system in general sil vocnoise sil like 
sil vocnoise i dont know i think its more of a vocnoise sil more of 
like a sil vocnoise its sil vocnoise college is a little bit different i guess 
but its more of like this whole like sil vocnoise sil the teacher sil vocnoise 
the teachers talking vocnoise and it like it like the information goes from like vocnoise 
the cutoffprofeprofesser sil like the teachers sil vocnoise sil uh mouth to the students notes 
with like out cutoffgogoing cutoffwwith without going through either of their brains you know its 
like just from like real monotonous and like you know dates and blah blah blah 
about sil vocnoise sil you know just like cutoffrereal its its a vocnoise sil its 
real structured but its real hard to think about sil what then what i could 
what to do to change that vocnoise its kind of like more sil vocnoise like 
sil vocnoise i dont know i mean i had really good like there was a 
couple really good teachers like my history cutoffteateachers teachers and english teachers were really good 
vocnoise um sil iver sil just because vocnoise you know sil it was more vocnoise 
sil like sil they seemed like they wanted to be there as opposed to vocnoise 
sil im just doing this cutoffffor because i dont know why or whatever and it 
seems like too vocnoise sil they they sil vocnoise i hate it when people sil 
its obvious that if they didnt have the textbook they wouldnt know how to do 
it vocnoise you know like where if people didnt have their notes like they wouldnt 
be able to do it themselves you know vocnoise its kind of like sil vocnoise 
um vocnoise and so i think vocnoise cutoffiits its cutoffiits sil that when people have 
real enthusiasm and like cutoffyyouknow or and sil put a lot of effort into making 
it not the same everyday not just like a lecture and when then we do 
vocnoise sil homework and turn it in like you know its like vocnoise we do 
vocnoise sil like vocnoise like in history class we do like role vocnoise role playing 
things and like iver plays unknown like we like just things that are different and 
like vocnoise my sociology and psychology teacher were real good he did he was the 
same guy who taught history vocnoise sil he was real good too like it was 
really crazy obviously but like vocnoise its just like vocnoise interesting vocnoise um sil like 
the sociology of high school and like having a sociology class about a unknown vocnoise 
just sil vocnoise laugh iver vocnoise sil well well its sort of like the sociology 
of like cliques you know vocnoise like how sil how that develops like vocnoise how 
people vocnoise like some people seek vocnoise to sil like sil fit in sil like 
sil like cutoffthatthats thats a real strong uh vocnoise like vocnoise vocnoise cutoffyyouknow cutoffhhow uh 
just how like too vocnoise how theres no real sil vocnoise like vocnoise everybody conforms 
to their sil own set of norms in each group yknow its like sil people 
vocnoise no matter like yknow even if ted kaczynski is out vocnoise like vocnoise cutoffoh 
uh on vocnoise yknow wherever in like his little shed vocnoise yknow hes still a 
part of society like how you cant get hesaway from society and just how like 
vocnoise how society develops in general like how high schools like vocnoise sil is vocnoise 
is kind of true to life but then really different too on how life is 
but just how sil vocnoise sil its just a sil a more of a vocnoise 
like sil more of a closeknit thing so its more apparent how how segregation works 
or whatever vocnoise iver laughyeah iver yeah iver yeah iver vocnoise people that cutoffjjust sil 
just uh vocnoise really wanna teach as opposed to like i dont know why other 
people wanna sil like sil even went into teaching at all yknow vocnoise but um 
vocnoise i think that would help just making it more like not so impersonal not 
so vocnoise this is sil yknow you do this to get this certain grade its 
like you do this to learn this because its interesting as opposed to like vocnoise 
and vocnoise i dont know vocnoise i think its like theres a lot of things 
that vocnoise its more vocnoise like compulsory noise vocnoise education is weird vocnoise like sil 
being forced to take this class like i think that if i uh but cutoffi 
i mean its good to being forced to take a cutoffbrobroad like a liberal arts 
thing because like you dont know what you cutoffwawant sil wanna do vocnoise so its 
like if like you hate math and you dont take it at all but then 
you decide you wanna do something in math then youre like screwed like vocnoise cant 
go back vocnoise iver laughyeah vocnoise iver laughyeah vocnoise see i hate that like vocnoise 
all the work that you do is like reduced to like one letter iver and 
its cutofflilike cutoffi i like how sil vocnoise see like i thought about going to 
antioch but it was it was really expensive and like sil um i dont know 
vocnoise but sil just because the hesand and the schools sil more of a vocnoise 
nontraditional cutofftytype type where noise they give you sil like evaluations and you dont get 
grades like and so vocnoise so then it cutoffllike sil thats what thats what i 
heard its like at antioch where the professor writes vocnoise uh like a couple page 
paper vocnoise on your sil like vocnoise performance on the quarter and that that really 
shows that vocnoise i mean thats a lot of work for the professor but like 
vocnoise that really shows that hes really involved in noticing what youre doing as opposed 
to vocnoise just like vocnoise sil some kid in his class you vocnoise iver yeah 
iver like vocnoise im not cutoffrreally sil vocnoise im not really sure like how vocnoise 
they sil how the interview works to become a teacher vocnoise um vocnoise i dont 
know i think its like a lot of times vocnoise theyre really desperate to find 
excludepeople sil and so they really just sil take whoever i mean vocnoise theyre lucky 
enough to even errorfhave have a body to fill the sil unknown sil place and 
theyre doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean sil 
sort of i mean vocnoise errorehi i mean i cutoffgguess its working well enough i 
guess i mean laugh unknown sil like sil people are learning things and like wanting 
to go on to college and stuff iver um iver i dont know sil vocnoise 
sil uh vocnoise maybe cutoffiit sil i think vocnoise maybe if vocnoise teachers just their 
status in society isnt real high when it should be vocnoise um sil its more 
vocnoise like i yknow ive heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers 
yknow and vocnoise how sil vocnoise but it um sil so its just like sil 
people always talk about yknow education for the cutoffchchildren vocnoise yknow we gotta like sil 
think about our childs future or whatever but vocnoise really teachers are vocnoise paid crap 
laughand like sil dont really get a lot of respect from anybody vocnoise like professors 
and stuff get cutoffrrespect vocnoise get cutoffrrespect like sil more of a respect but vocnoise 
like vocnoise its just like sil errorteatteach like the teachers that you have especially in 
elementary school like in critical periods in sil in your life like in errorchr like 
especially in adolescence too like really influence like how you are as a person and 
like people dont sil like take that for granted a lot vocnoise like if you 
have bad teachers in one subject youre gonna hate that subject vocnoise yknow and like 
if you have good teachers youre gonna love it i mean vocnoise that really cutoffininfluences 
influences too like how sil like what you wanna do with your life yknow sil 
and people dont really sil acknowledge that too much iver vocnoise laughyeah iver laugh sometimes 
i think that its just like math sucks and its like sil vocnoise iver laughthats 
a like theres no theres not a lot you really you can really do with 
that vocnoise laugh iver yeah iver laugh vocnoise iver okay noise yeah sure noise laugh 
no its okay iver laughyeah iver iver okay iver well i didnt know if sil 
youd give them my name noiseor vocnoise yeah if you can iver no noiseoffense its 
easier than trying to call up iver i will even went to the vocnoise they

i was sixteen when i got out of high school and then i took my 
g e d at seventeen sil and passed it plus was i went in marine 
corps at seventeen iver it was probably the best thing for me vocnoise iver noiseyeah 
because i vocnoise iver well i met a lot more different cultures seen how a 
lot more different people live and found out how lucky i was iver yknow vocnoise 
when you go over there and see people begging for can of beans iver and 
then you come here you know what i mean you see people standing out on 
street corners with signs work for food iver i feel like i should be standing 
out there giving money because my bills are getting behind iver yknow iver yeah vocnoise 
and people dont iver dont realize it iver to some extent yeah but to some 
extent no because see when i was in the service it was a different time 
sil iver sil uh vocnoise sil vocnoise sil well take for one thing sil when 
i was overseas if we wanted to do something wed wait till sergeant went the 
shed and wed just put a padlock on the door so he couldnt get out 
iver and then wed go do what we wanted to do sil iver sil yknow 
sil because when youre overseas its a different environment sil iver sil people are more 
scared of you than you are of them iver sil especially if youre vocnoise sil 
waiting to go into combat vocnoise iver vocnoise because you gotta trust the people youre 
around you dont sil really wanna piss them off iver excuse me but you know 
what i mean iver vocnoise sil and theres a lot of alcoholics in the military 
when i was in there vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah iver and vocnoise most the time 
theyre putting them in charge well like wed get vocnoise no offense wed get these 
college students coming out that were second lieutenants that thought they know everything iver vocnoise 
and some of them did and some of them sil were just complete idiots but 
you find that vocnoise anywhere vocnoise iver sil iver sil so you took your good 
for your bad vocnoise iver sil iver vocnoise i got a lot of respect for 
the college kids sil majority of them its vocnoise sil its vocnoise other people i 
dont have laughrespect for vocnoise iver unknown iver well like management here vocnoise iver well 
like im getting ready to go through layoffs again where i work at iver but 
yet they got people we had no manager sil say for three months sil so 
course they took somebody that they were gonna lay off put them in a management 
position theyre making eighty thousand dollars a year iver the cant see nothing wrong with 
that iver sil but sil yet they wont lay off people that actually sil need 
the jobs iver so vocnoise sil the way the university here is run i cant 
agree with most stuff they do vocnoise iver like i said ive been here twenty 
five years ive seen a lot of weird stuff vocnoise sil fact is was at 
baker i seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years iver yet 
paid sil every week for doing nothing iver yeah iver unknown iver yeah vocnoise it 
aint gonna change though vocnoise iver vocnoise im just an operator right now ive done 
production work too for them iver but basically i went back in operations because sil 
its not the money i like the job vocnoise iver just mount tapes uh sil 
do printouts monitor systems uh sil people have problems help solve them iver just different 
stuff its different every day thats why i like it just like sil you talking 
to people its different every day iver and sil i dont like sitting in an 
office iver vocnoise uh i did when i worked at the hospital i worked at 
the hospital here over here where im at vocnoise i dont but im in a 
big room like as big as a gymnasium vocnoise and im in there by myself 
iver which is kinda nice i can turn the radio on iver do whatever i 
want to some degree vocnoise iver vocnoise depends on vocnoise vocnoise whos the manager is 
the time every managers got a different agenda on whats sil they want you to 
do iver vocnoise i thought it sil was stupid iver yeah vocnoise iver vocnoise well 
vocnoise sil vocnoise they needed to strike dont get me wrong thats not the stupid 
part vocnoise but the part extwas uh vocnoise a majority of them saying that they 
were here for ten years and aint making that much money most people would move 
on iver the university never has money thats like me when i sil first came 
here the university was not paying me nothing i worked two cutoffyiyryears vocnoise or two 
jobs for ten years when i was here the first ten years just to make 
a living iver yeah sil and uh vocnoise i had the prerogative i coulda gone 
somewhere else and made more money vocnoise yknow but well what the bad part was 
is universitys trying to do away with civil service vocnoise civil service is a good 
thing and a bad sil thing vocnoise yknow you do vocnoise you had vocnoisestep raises 
and everything so it least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have 
nothing iver its like where i work at vocnoise the only way i can get 
raise is by being sil uh vocnoise like the kids used to say a tattletale 
sil squealer whatever you wanna call iver only way i can get a raise over 
there where work at iver to be a rat iver yeah iver and its not 
iver and thats not right so ive always gotten two percent raises sil even though 
vocnoise sil uh vocnoise sil basically vocnoise sil i been crosstrained or however you wanna 
say it i can work in three or four areas where most people cant vocnoise 
but ive seen people get ten percent raises sil and ive seen me get two 
percent raise when im doing three jobs and theyre doing one iver but it vocnoise 
im using me as example because ive seen a lot of other people do the 
same thing dont get me wrong iver but it just depends upon it still come 
back to who you know iver because they done away with the uh vocnoise sil 
civil service step raises which were wrong cause coulda done crummy job and got same 
raise as doing a good job dont get me wrong vocnoise but now vocnoise it 
is that you got vocnoise sil people you dont even respect in management a lot 
of times giving the raises and they vocnoise sil have no idea what youre even 
doing iver cutoffeygexample sil example that i asked my manager the other day she told 
me i was supposed to do this vocnoise certain thing and i asked her i 
said well vocnoise they told me i wasnt supposed to vocnoise iver and she said 
shed get back to me on it sil well never heard nothing from her vocnoise 
sil and shes done that to me i dont know how many times iver but 
yet that leaves the door open for who to get in trouble iver yeah iver 
makes her look good iver vocnoise well iver its just like your cutoffpiypeople people you 
see go to church that walk out of church see somebody sitting there thats homeless 
iver theyll ignore them wont they vocnoise sil because theyre in their good sunday clothes 
iver well basically the same thing here vocnoise but sil some of your management is 
real good ive seen people that sil that sil yknow are super vocnoise but ive 
seen people that are bad problem is you get a bad management sil and it 
can make your life hell i dont care who you are vocnoise iver unknown nice 
manager vocnoise iver so yknow what i mean sil i can outlast them iver and 
i do my job thats sometimes that sil vocnoise basically hurts worse than sil if 
you do your job and people know you do your job you got more people 
thatll stick up for you vocnoise without knowing it iver thats fine iver well iver 
let me ask you this sil where the sil wheres the nearest teen club sil 
there is none sil wheres the nearest playground there is none sil wheres the nearest 
sports center there is none vocnoise sil so laughbasically theres not a whole lot to 
do except for the hanging out vocnoise so yeah i think society as a whole 
unknown more violent vocnoise the kids are more violent look at the news you see 
on tv every day you see people getting mad just sil cause theyre sitting in 
traffic iver thats adults iver see people vocnoise now all sudden theres a rash of 
fires sil you read that in news people keep doing it vocnoise i think society 
as a whole vocnoise has gotten lot more violent which made the kids more violent 
iver i dont think its the cartoons cause come on if theyre that stupid vocnoise 
yknow what i mean they they shouldnt even be out on the street im sorry 
iver cause thats like me i watch the three stooges and you dont see me 
put no crowbar up nobodys nose iver yknow iver hesyou hesyou vocnoise what it is 
is most people want dont want kids to live in reality vocnoise iver and uh 
vocnoise these kids that are violent vocnoise your whole societys violent i got vocnoise okay 
vocnoise sil i just got done helping my sister in law vocnoise thats an example 
right there shes got five kids vocnoise shes on welfare vocnoise vocnoise her husbands vocnoise 
is vocnoise arab right iver vocnoise hes running an illegal business vocnoisehere iver the united 
states knows about it vocnoise they cutoffkehcant sil sit there and theyll pay the welfare 
sil they wont do nothing to him iver now whats what kind of impression is 
sil her kids getting iver yknow iver well hes uh vocnoise exporting cars illegally iver 
yeah vocnoise iver but hes also vocnoise like i said hes got five kids they 
live in low income housing theyre collecting welfare iver and vocnoise she just came here 
sil and lived with me a year ago she could have her baby here vocnoise 
iver so the state would pay for it iver so he wouldnt have to pay 
for it iver and she went back to him iver well i think the people 
that made that law should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs 
for more than two years and see how they like it iver cause theres some 
people that actually cant work iver my sister in law is one of them she 
is just exttoo stupid iver shes got like a third grade education shes like a 
kid herself iver now people like that cant work when i was a kid vocnoise 
sil your family took care of you there wasnt sil the welfare and stuff vocnoise 
like this vocnoise but you dont have a family structure no more vocnoise iver vocnoise 
uh youre in a high tech society and most people you said youre from new 
york right sil your familys where vocnoise iver okay so how are you gonna help 
them when theyre all over iver used to be you lived in a little neighborhood 
you knew all your neighbors you dont have that now everybody is mobile vocnoise iver 
they errorstjust had on the news most people keep the house five to seven years 
before they sell it and move on iver yeah vocnoise iver yeah iver same iver 
ive been in the same house for seventeen years iver and the only way id 
move is if the neighborhood went down and vocnoise when i say went down im 
talking about way down sil i like where im at iver and i got good 
neighbors laugh iver i think that influences how everybody behaves not only the kids the 
adults too iver vocnoise well vocnoise its vocnoise well lets put it this way i 
can go out and make money without even making money off the government agencies if 
i wanted to if i wanted to be a crook i could vocnoise i could 
be a crook sil and uh laugh i could have people rent me a house 
low income i could move in there iver i could do all kinds of stuff 
vocnoise yknow iver to make money on the side vocnoise all through the government sil 
uh vocnoise sil thats what i mean it its too easy to get away with 
stuff nowadays iver well iver lets put this way if your kids are in my 
yard doing something and i yelled at them vocnoise youre liable to come down to 
my house and either shoot me sue me vocnoise or have me locked up right 
iver when i was a kid if vocnoise neighbor yelled at me vocnoise i better 
make damn sure he didnt tell my dad iver because i wouldve gotten my ass 
whipped iver nowadays you dont have that iver yknow what are you going to vocnoise 
you hit that kid vocnoise youre going to jail iver yeah vocnoise yeah iver well 
is it iver i had the same thing happen to my kid hesi i smacked 
him one time iver yknow and it was in the butt going get me wrong 
vocnoise he told me he was gonna have me uh locked up for child abuse 
sil so i threw his ass in the car and took him downtown vocnoise and 
took him inside sil and told him to tell them people sil because theyre gonna 
lock him up iver if im an unfit parent not me sil that put a 
stop to that right away iver uh about twelve iver because see im his stepfather 
iver and ive heard the thing yknow youre not my real father and all that 
we went through all that iver thats just like i told him sil take everything 
you got that your real father got you iver and you can hit the road 
if you want vocnoise of course the only thing he had was nothing iver now 
i got him iver i got him sounds like i bought a dog iver but 
yknow what i mean when he was about nine years old but hes known me 
sil all my life sil so yknow what i mean it wasnt no big shock 
iver uh vocnoise but see his father lived right around corner and never even had 
nothing to do with him iver but when he did have something to do with 
him vocnoise it was kinda strange they would go out and whistle at girls and 
stuff like that iver and and yknow i was sil here i am in a 
predicament i cant say nothing to them iver yknow sil thats his real father so 
i gotta sit there and keep my mouth shut iver yeah laugh iver none vocnoise 
whatsoever vocnoise iver hell cutoffbasicbasically yeah hell basically tell you he dont have no except 
for me iver oh yeah iver yeah but see that was coming from his vocnoisefriends 
more than him iver yknow iver vocnoise but of course whenever they needed a ride 
or anything like that they come to me iver yknow sil well vocnoise its just 
the same as when i was a kid iver its whatever you gonna get away 
with iver yknow vocnoise iver umhum iver vocnoise iver yeah but fifty years ago if 
you had epilepsy theyd lock you in closet and throw away the key vocnoise and 
wouldnt let vocnoiseyou out vocnoise most the parent ive seen sil hesuh to me id 
rather see the kids with a step parent iver because ive seen lot of bad 
parents vocnoise ive cutoffshseen sil seen a lotta bad people you know what i mean 
i vocnoise have vocnoiseseen vocnoise people vocnoise know you vocnoisealwayshear about drugs and all that 
vocnoise ive seen people sitting there drinking iver you ask where their cutoffkikids i dont 
know hes outside somewhere iver now those people dont wanna take time nowadays its easier 
just to give a kid a sil beeper iver if you need them beep them 
iver then actually know where hes going iver every kid that my kid ran around 
with i knew his parents sil one way or the other iver and yknow vocnoise 
id show up at their house if i thought something was going on know sil 
yknow it dont matter to me im just vocnoise like said i vocnoise grew up 
here in columbus ohio im just a dumb hillbilly vocnoise laughyknow vocnoise like cutoffaw sil 
hesuh sil if they were having a party at somebodys house and their parents didnt 
know id vocnoiseshow up sil there asking what the hell was going on iver yknow 
iver hesand iver no because them kids still stop at my house iver even though 
my kid is not there theyll stop by my house just to say hi iver 
vocnoise and most kids dont do that nowadays iver yknow iver well cutoffalalso sil also 
too when is the last time you seen a baseball game vocnoise kids playing a 
baseball game in the neighborhood iver you dont iver extno iver yeah iver whats really 
weird is i can go over my moms neighborhood vocnoise youll still see kids playing 
out there in the school yard playing baseball vocnoise now i got a sil school 
yard right next to me you come up there and you see no kids doing 
it iver cutoffsah sil its like sil each sil neighborhoods got a little different noisepersonality 
iver vocnoise i think thats bullshit vocnoise iver laughyknow iver noise iver my dad was 
crippled for hesuh for nine months he was in a cast from his neck down 
to his ankles iver hesuh he had sil a hip fusion is what it was 
called back then they had no sil artificial hips vocnoise he had one leg three 
inches shorter than the other and he had no hip joint sil whatsoever it was 
just iver ground up bone vocnoise so my mom was working and uh cutofff cutoffah 
vocnoise this going to sound sickening vocnoise i was vocnoisetwelve years old id even have 
to come home from school and stick suppositories up him iver to take care of 
him i mean for twelve years old no offense iver when vocnoisethatsyour laughdadthats laugh laughthataintthebestplace 
to be laughgoingwhenyougetoffschoolyouknow iver and hesuh sil it didnt hurt me none vocnoise yknow sil 
hesuh sil i think it just depends upon like i said vocnoise a lot of 
factors know its your neighborhood your neighbors sil hesuh sil most kids dont have nothing 
to do in their neighborhood vocnoise even sil and how many empty lots do you 
see nowadays sil it still comes back to vocnoise like when i was a kid 
we had go carts we had mini bikes we had all that kind of stuff 
iver yknow cutoffah sil vocnoise aint no way in hell you have noiseone nowadays iver 
your kid be thrown in jail youd be getting sued for not having insurance iver 
yknow cutoffitits sil society again is taking away everything from you iver yes and no 
vocnoise uh when we were in boy scouts we got kicked out of it laugh 
iver vocnoiseso sil yknow what i mean we had more fun on our extown vocnoise 
uh where i grew up i grew up sil like i said right over here 
on olentangy there used to be a sil pond over here at the cemetery we 
used to go vocnoisefishing there everyday or iver this is in the summer now wed 
go down to sil uh vocnoiseolentangy river to go vocnoisefishing unknown over there where hesuh 
sil dodridge is sil there used to be a bash recreation center with a miniature 
golf course and everything iver now what thats industrial nuclearonics or something like that vocnoise 
think about now you got the wetlands down there sil yknow noise where are kids 
gonna go iver no noise not sil like they used to iver the cutoffmmajority majority 
are the ones that dont get the guidance sil at home sil that youre trying 
to reach aint gonna go to boy scouts iver laugh laughyknow iver hesuh vocnoise basically 
what you need more is vocnoise like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood 
iver where they can go everyday sil the way i look at it vocnoise also 
exttoo hesuh sil when i was a kid like i said i started working two 
jobs when i was fourteen you cant even find a job unless youre sixteen nowadays 
iver so its kinda hard you know what i mean cutofftto sil to do a 
lotta things iver because cutofftheytheyre cutofftheytheyre theyre saying youre still a kid but yet you 
know what i mean vocnoise cant do this you cant do that iver vocnoise yeah 
iver yeah but i mean yknow vocnoise a vocnoisekid that sil you know might wanna 
save up for something when hes twelve years old has no chance at all getting 
a job iver yeah hesyou well we did that too iver sil iver i got 
one sister iver yeah iver yeah she lives over by uh riverside hospital iver about 
once a week sil my wife sees her usually more than me vocnoise iver laughyes 
iver no my mom vocnoise uh vocnoiseshes not an invalid vocnoise uh shes seventy two 
years old but sil they go out sil usually to yard sales sil stuff like 
that stuff i dont wanna do iver no offense iver yeah iver well put this 
way vocnoise sil when i was a kid vocnoise you didnt wanna be brought home 
by the police vocnoise you were actually scared of police sil nowadays cutoffwhwhat whats kids 
scared of nothing iver aint a damn thing theyre scared of whenever we were kids 
we used to make zip guns vocnoise wed take an ink pen sil take the 
pen piece out put a firecracker in iver put so it fizzed and yknow youd 
pack it full and you had a gun iver you know that the stuff like 
thats sil always been around vocnoise but it seems now that sil the guns are 
more vocnoise sil vocnoise sil you can get them easier vocnoise its like me i 
could be carrying a gun right now what are they gonna do to me iver 
they aint gonna lock me up iver carrying a concealed weapon theyre gonna slap me 
on the arm iver now if i shoot you they might do cutoffsahmsomething i mean 
dont get me wrong i aint vocnoise but i mean if i shoot you they 
might do something but otherwise than that they aint gonna do nothing iver depends upon 
how i store it now vocnoise when i was a kid raised up we had 
gun locks on our guns even though i could pick them sil i mean it 
iver gun locks are easy to pick you can break into anything vocnoise uh vocnoise 
sil but when i was a kid too we used go out turkey shoots and 
id go hunting all the time vocnoise so i was pretty familiar with guns vocnoise 
my kid uh he grew up he was familiar with guns sil he also knew 
not to touch them iver if you know what i mean vocnoise but i had 
no pistols at my house i had shotguns and rifles vocnoise now to me a 
lot of these pistols like a twenty five caliber sil come on there is no 
use for gun like that iver thirty eight derringer yknow iver the only time the 
use for guns like that is to carry to shoot somebody vocnoise when i cutoffwworked 
vocnoise yeah when iver when i worked at bars i carried a gun constantly and 
vocnoise most the cops in neighborhood knew i carried a gun iver but they didnt 
say nothing to me because they knew the reason why sil its because i carried 
the bar receipts vocnoise now i could see to carrying one to that sil degree 
but vocnoise sil therere sil you know theres a limit you got all these people 
carrying guns because theyll tell you well its the neighborhood i live in or you 
have women carrying guns even down here on campus vocnoise because they walk late at 
night iver uh vocnoise its just sil there we go again whos right whos wrong 
i have no idea iver and you even got these sil the uh what stunt 
guns theyre the ones that scare me vocnoise iver vocnoise what iver them little electric 
shock things iver i got a bad heart i dont know what thatd do to 
me iver vocnoise yeah but vocnoise guns are always gonna be around aint gonna get 
rid of them iver but why would you make stricter gun laws when you cant 
even enforce your traffic laws iver yknow so basically vocnoise well yeah it might work 
but to me its kinda stupid yknow because what youre saying is vocnoise were gonna 
take this vocnoise law and extreally gonna stick you on this vocnoise law but the 
hell with all the other laws sil so is that really fair iver i iver 
ive almost been hit i dont know how many times people talking on telephones i 
see people turning with no turn signals iver yknow just turn right out front of 
you vocnoise everybodys running red lights nowadays vocnoise mean which laws you gonna pick out 
to enforce and which laws aint you iver uh sil to me if you gonna 
enforce the gun laws and make them sil stricter vocnoise what you ought to do 
is sil put a limit vocnoise on the barrel length and stuff on guns you 
get caught with a gun vocnoise with a cutoffsg sil barrel smaller than uh sil 
eight inches you go to jail iver no ands ifs or buts you go to 
jail for three years iver if you got an eight inch barrel on your gun 
now you tell me where are you gonna put it iver you isnt gonna get 
a lot of dates iver laughyknow iver but sil you understand what im saying its 
cutoffk sil you gonna have to make sil make it so the guns that you 
got are harder to conceal iver vocnoise yeah iver well vocnoise you can carry a 
weapon here in columbus sil i can carry a weapon right now as long as 
out the open iver course im gonna get stopped for suspicious person everywhere i go 
iver but vocnoise yknow hesi hesits still sil the sil its constitution and stuff like 
that vocnoise yknow they always bring it back our forefathers did this and our forefathers 
did that vocnoise well our forefathers also sil were squatters does that mean i can 
move into this room iver and tell you its mine now iver come on yknow 
vocnoise people vocnoise i dont know id hate to be in a predicament of having 
to change anything sil because be hard to change for one group and not another 
iver you know vocnoise so i dont know where to go vocnoise to me the 
biggest thing would be if they got rid of these saturday night special guns and 
stuff like that iver yeah iver youre cutoffsstill iver cutoffyihyou sil yeah you always still 
gonna have violence like we were kids vocnoise like me and you would meet wed 
get in a fight and after that wed be best friends now vocnoise now id 
be walking down the street vocnoise hell fourteen year olds scare me to death right 
now iver not knowing theyre gonna whip out a gun or not he aint gonna 
go to jail iver and then theyre gonna say they wanna nail their parents sil 
yknow their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what their kids doing 
iver the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and 
then society has so much responsibility so sil you know what i mean basically all 
that sil sil all ive ever seen is vocnoise well like these kids that get 
in the house vocnoise sil they go to the house they find a gun and 
they wanna hold the parents responsible vocnoise sil vocnoise yes and no on that vocnoise 
if the parents had the gun sil in the house they had the vocnoise sil 
extuh vocnoise ammunition locked up say in the trunk of their car sil what if 
the kid bought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the 
gun iver so basically theres no way sil unknown sil you know unless you have 
a steel cabinet to put that gun in vocnoise and there we go sil rich 
can afford that but the poor cant iver and most your people that sil own 
guns that are sil killing people are usually your poorer people iver most the vocnoisetrouble 
i have sil uh i got one neighbor that hates me and hes a sheriff 
iver and vocnoise otherwise no i dont have hardly any trouble with the kids i 
have more trouble with the parents iver yknow iver i dont iver no i dont 
fear none of the kids iver vocnoise iver yes to some degree they should but 
there we go again thats just like the people when i worked in bars vocnoise 
theyd always want to hold the vocnoisebartender responsible vocnoise but say you could come up 
sil i give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else iver 
but even though youre not responsible im the one supposed be responsible vocnoise hesuh vocnoise 
people sil yknow that have the beer party in the house vocnoise yeah hesthey they 
should be held responsible sil to some degree but sil were in a society that 
loves to sue people iver yknow how far are they held responsible i dont know 
youd have to go on a case by case basis iver on that iver well 
when vocnoise when i was growing up there wasnt as that much violence and i 
could go in indiana and i have done it now vocnoise my name aint on 
this report so you cant do nothing about iver i picked eighty pounds of pot 
sil one time growing along the railroad tracks and brought it back to columbus sil 
eighty pounds iver hesit it used to grow wild when i was vocnoisea kid iver 
you could find it all over the place iver and you didnt vocnoisehave the violence 
and stuff like that i have never extheard sil and yknow im just using pot 
right now iver ive never heard anybody going on a vocnoise sil shooting rampage that 
were high on pot most of them are sitting home waiting on a pizza iver 
iver iver sil huh sil and sil its just like cocaine and stuff like that 
you know your laws are different crack cocaine is one sil powder cocaine is another 
sil you know and sil what theyre saying sil on that is thats sil a 
sil prejudice thing is what they are saying because they are saying more blacks sil 
do sil crack cocaine than powder cocaine sil prison thing im sure you a pizza 
iver you know now iver ive seen more people violent on liquor vocnoise like said 
i worked in bars and im vocnoise iver vocnoise and ive cutoffsseen vocnoise its just 
like cocaine and stuff like that you know your laws are different crack cocaines one 
vocnoise the powder cocaines another vocnoise you know and vocnoise what theyre saying cutoffiis sil 
on that is uh vocnoise thats a prejudice thing is what theyre saying cause theyre 
saying more blacks do cutoffkcocaine crack cocaine than powder cocaine cause of prison thing im 
sure youve read the papers vocnoise the way i look at it uh ive had 
four heart attacks every time i have a heart attack okay sil they swear up 
and down i do cocaine iver which ive never done i dont want to vocnoise 
but sil to me sil some drugs should be legal sil some drugs should be 
illegal vocnoise but to me sil alcohol should be more illegal than half your drugs 
iver because ive seen more violence sil on alcohol ive seen more women beat ive 
seen more kids beat vocnoise ive seen more drunken driving wrecks iver vocnoise yknow iver 
well vocnoiseyouve seen people driving wrong way on the freeway right iver when theyre drunk 
vocnoise whens the last time you read about somebody driving the wrong way on the 
freeway from smoking a joint iver cutoffguh iver yeah iver noiseoreither that or theyre so 
paranoid you know what i mean noisetheyremore worried about stopping iver and im just using 
that as an example you know what i mean your other drugs i dont know 
sil much about them iver well they always did because first time i had one 
i was thirty six years old iver and whenever you have a heart attack anymore 
they always cutoffsussuspect suspect coke is the first thing iver because it stops your heart 
right away iver yeah noisethats what i mean they go by your age too iver 
yeah and then when they vocnoise yeah iver yeah then when they did the blood 
test they found out i had hypertension plus laughcardiovascular disease sil had nothing laughdowithdrugs iver

was iver yeah iver uh i blew a noisedisc out iver and i couldnt walk 
at all iver so they vocnoise i have o s u insurance but i had

give them let them work seventy five percent if theyre sick i had a heart 
attack had to come back to work early because i was out of sick leave 
vocnoise and like i said ive been here twenty five years and they would not 
even put me on first shift because they said it wasnt sil a good enough 
reason iver yeah iver until i threatened to vocnoise sue them iver second and third 
i was working sixteen hour days a lot of times covering sil thats one of 
the reasons they werent going to move me iver well my doctor told me my 
blood pressure would be better vocnoise if i slept at night instead of staying up 
iver cause of your internal clock iver and i was trying to do everything and 
then also too they wanted me to go to therapy iver which was scheduled in 
the evenings i when was working and i couldnt even go to therapy vocnoise iver 
when i threatened to take them to court sil and it took sil almost two 
months sil after that iver but i vocnoise i had a note in sil before 
i had the heart attack vocnoise id already had two heart attacks i had a 
note in that i needed to be on first shift or id probably have another 
heart attack vocnoise and they would not put me on first shift then i had 
vocnoise another heart attack vocnoise put me in the hospital and then i had a 
cutoffhheart another heart attack when i was in the hospital vocnoise and when i came 
out thats when i sil gave them another note stating i needed to really be 
on first shift iver and thats when they said no iver its cutoffaall iver its 
all documented vocnoise sil iver yeah told me to exercise which i do told me 
quit smoking which i been trying no offense its harder to quit iver uh iver 
yeah stay away from salts uh sodium and stuff like that vocnoise pop uh coffee 
i dont have no problem there i dont drink coffee i drink a lot of 
pop though uh vocnoise sil like pork products iver yeah noise iver vocnoise yeah because 
i dont like vegetables my hands are going to sleep vocnoise i dont like vegetables 
is what it is so its real hard for me iver uh the exercise i 
do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so iver 
but vocnoise in the winter is when yknow i mean i dont exercise that much 
iver my bill collectors are the ones that scared of that iver vocnoise its like 
this vocnoise what can i do iver laughyouknowwhatimean iver yeah but you put up with 
that anywhere its not just ohio state itd be anywhere you go yknow sil vocnoise 
its just like i said sil you get excuse me your assholes in vocnoise iver 
noiseand they leave then you get sil either another asshole or somebody good you just 
wait until you get somebody good iver its like youre doing interviews iver you might

of them iver yeah because uh vocnoise theyre more vocnoise you always hear about my 
black ass my sil you know what i mean and stuff like this and i 
could give a shit iver you know what i mean it dont matter to me 
whether youre black or white it matters to me whether way you treat me vocnoise 
like when i first got out service is when they really started affirmative action i 
was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they couldnt hire me 
because of that was when they first come down with a mandate that they could 
only hire blacks iver so i was shut out of the job market then uh 
vocnoise that didnt even bother me i thought well fine vocnoise i went thats when 
i got the job at channel four vocnoise but uh vocnoise its like anything else 
some blacks use it for good some blacks use it for bad sil iver and 
if i was in the laughsamesituation id be doing the same thing so iver you

veteran so you know what i mean iver everybody gets something iver youre a woman

thats eventually going get in trouble noise sil iver sil iver sil yeah but iver 
sil iver sil yeah sil iver well no they dont iver no i dont sil

vocnoise the talk and stuff its not sil uh sil like sil you know what

like regular people sil iver sil you know iver sil im not really am sure 
how to answer that vocnoise sil i would say more conservative iver but i might 
be wrong because vocnoise sil my answer wouldnt be that good on that sil question 
no offense but you know what i mean vocnoise sil its iver iver sil yeah 
because like sil i think columbus is more friendly than most places iver you know 
like when i was out in california it was like theyd spit on you vocnoise

at a cycle shop sil but i was in the service but i was working

talk to the devil sil iver you know sil like i told her its the 
way i was raised iver when i retire vocnoise sil hesuh id like to move

around columbus iver vocnoise sil i dont like the way columbus is heading vocnoise sil 
ah vocnoise sil laugh sil for a big city dont get me wrong you can 
get anywhere real easy in this town iver but when i say i dont like 
the way its heading sil vocnoise sil theyre cramming so many houses and everything and 
apartments and stuff iver its getting sil so congested its thats vocnoise sil what i 
dont like sil iver sil yeah i had a boat and i got rid of 
it because sil vocnoise sil i will not even go up there vocnoise sil iver 
sil go to hoover laugh iver sil yeah sil iver whats really weird is sil 
where i live at i live right by excludename sil right sil i dont even 
have city water and sewer sil im the only one on my side of the 
street sil iver im the sil only little one on my whole block sil iver 
theyre build two hundred thousand dollar houses sil laugheverywhere around me iver these people drive 
by look at my little house there in the middle of it all sil iver 
with nobody around nothing but land sil iver hey iver i dont know sil thats 
the way i am iver well see thats like a big thing you dont understand 
when northland sil shopping center closed down and all the vocnoise sil where where im 
at vocnoise sil they got so many of them strip malls like youre talking about 
with stores sil extout of them sil iver sil you know and then easton you 
dont hear much about that anymore iver yeah iver ive seen that iver sil yes 
but there we go again you know thatd be better vocnoise sil there used to 
be a place in upper arlington on zollinger road when i was a sil kid 
vocnoise sil it used to be called the arc vocnoise sil you heard of the 
group the byrds right sil iver they came and played there one time that was 
a sil teen club iver like i said you have nothing like that for kids 
nowadays iver and at whetstone park they used to have shelter house in the summer 
they held teen dances sil every vocnoise sil weekend iver yeah sil iver and in 
the winter vocnoise theyd build big extbonfires out there where the casting ponds was let 
you skate they have big bonfires sil when youre done skating iver dont have nothing 
like that nowadays vocnoise somebody would fall through the ice and theyd sue them iver 
yeah but they dont have it iver yknow iver vocnoise sil there aint nothing else 
to do vocnoise sil well back when i was a kid they had battles of 
the bands at the mall sil iver northland mall would host battle of the bands 
once a month sil iver sil veterans memorial would have it valleydale had uh sil 
extbattle of the bands and stuff like that you know places where kids could go 
sil well vocnoise iver i just like because its smaller sil iver sil and i 
like the area its pretty flat down there and plus see southern ohios got a 
cutofflalot lot of good places to fish iver sil iver sil so thats sil mainly 
its probably more for sil fishing iver sil because i like johnstown sil better vocnoise 
if you really want know but there isnt many places to fish up there well 
is that good enough vocnoise iver laugh iver iver okay iver do you want to 
know where i was born iver alright i was born in boston vocnoise uh lived 
there vocnoise but cutoffbefbefore i moved away before i really even remember it moved to 
detroit vocnoise uh when i was there i spent vocnoise about ten years there then 
moved to ohio vocnoise uh with my family of course and then sil right now 
vocnoise uh vocnoise im uh vocnoise at ashland university vocnoise but im thinking about vocnoise 
coming to o s u thats why i came down for the summer because i 
have friends down here so im taking a look at it vocnoise so basically vocnoise 
thats basically geographically where ive been iver uh yeah my parents live in akron vocnoise 
uh like north of akron cuyahoga falls area vocnoise but vocnoise like i said i 
my uh sil i had apartment down there vocnoise but like for the summer im 
down here so vocnoise im a transient always moving my stuff iver uhhum iver its 
a real boring boring town iver i feel iver i feel like uh i have 
friends and when we say oh were going out to the bar like we all 
know which bar because there is only one that college students go to and then 
vocnoise so iver no no um vocnoise theres a few townie bars but college students 
arent real welcome there vocnoise so iver yeah basically for the entire summer vocnoise and 
then if i like it vocnoise ah vocnoise ill be vocnoise ill be enrolling sil 
so iver vocnoise no my roommates are im just my mom wanted me to but 
vocnoise i sil uh the way it errorstemsstands right now id just noise and rather 
work vocnoise earn money iver yeah well actually i uh do silk screening for t 
shirts for my sil like vocnoise for sil um sil like on the side for 
myself like vocnoise to generate income vocnoise and then vocnoise also cutoffafs vocnoise as of 
vocnoise monday sil uh im working sil at ohio excludename its an environmental group vocnoise 
i will cutoffdihdoing sil be doing canvassing type stuff just basically going door to door 
vocnoise sign this petition iver stuff like that iver yeah yeah its uh vocnoise three 
hundred fifty a week sil for forty hours vocnoise but i like the hours more 
than anything because its two to ten iver so i can sleep in and iver 
yeah exactly in the middle of the afternoon yeah iver thats thats gonna be a 
problem they said bring bring water vocnoise youre gonna definitely like they have no dress 
code which is nice so im just gonna wear shorts vocnoise some good walking shoes 
and in a t shirt because vocnoise it could get rough vocnoise he could get 
real rough i bet iver laugh iver um well vocnoise actually vocnoise i wanted to 
learn more about it i felt like vocnoise like i really vocnoise have no passion 
towards it but i thought this would be a good way to learn about it 
and maybe pick up vocnoise like uh iver some ideals vocnoise ideas about it so 
vocnoise i figure its something i should know about so laugh iver like uh right 
now their biggest campaign is uh vocnoise the cutoffmarmarion vocnoise some elementary school i believe 
vocnoise or no unknown i think its a high school in marion vocnoise was built 
on um vocnoise an old vocnoise weapons depot and so like leukemia has rise and 
vocnoise so like thats uh their main campaign now is to inform the public and 
vocnoise try and uh get that changed vocnoise they have also done other things ah 
sil other uh they do anything vocnoise dealing with the environment vocnoise uh like vocnoise 
exposure vocnoise uh things like that so iver vocnoise its for the entire state vocnoise 
and so this is just the columbus there is columbus toledo dayton vocnoise i dont 
know any others iver laughno no vocnoise not at all vocnoise theres not much in 
ashland iver laugh iver yeah vocnoise exactly vocnoise pass through it vocnoise random jobs for 
iver yeah like when i do the silkscreening in this is kind of random but 
vocnoise just anything iver thatd be great laugh i would do it definitely iver im 
living over on iuka vocnoise uh if you sil on the other side of high 
street you know the mcdonalds right by high street its like iver back there a 
block vocnoise so its sil right near vocnoise like lot of other student housing iver 
laugh iver umhum vocnoise yeah i am just learning the area so vocnoise but i 
like it so far it seems really nice vocnoise and uh vocnoise ah it seems 
like theres a lot more to do in columbus obviously vocnoise but iver my mom 
teaches there vocnoise so its free tuition i get a tuition waiver iver so vocnoise 
and i figured i have a hundred vocnoise up to a hundred and fifty four 
credits vocnoise and so vocnoise im to im up to like ninety four right now 
and i figured that would be a decent vocnoise i mean it translates over because 
were on semesters vocnoise it will sil get all messed up there but sil hesits 
its like vocnoise im vocnoise half way to three fourths done with uh with my 
degree so vocnoise if i wanted to transfer now would be like because i after 
this point if i stay any longer vocnoise a lot of the credits wont transfer 
over it would vocnoise be a waste of time vocnoise because most places dont like 
to take more than half noise so vocnoise thats why i just figure right now 
i should look iver yeah exactly exactly iver no it uh like im a business 
major and i hear the business school here is pretty good vocnoise so uh i 
wanted to take a look at that and my roommate is a business major so 
he he was going to show me around the they have new buildings i guess 
vocnoise so he said he would show me around there vocnoise uh vocnoise also i 
vocnoise i really do like i came down for few games and things like that 
and vocnoise i like the enthusiasm that people have for this place like ashland is 
so small vocnoise theres a select group that has enthusiasm vocnoise but vocnoise nothing like 
here i mean this is laughridiculous everyone is just enthusiastic about the university and vocnoise 
heseven there might be things they dont like specifically about the university there uh vocnoise 
i vocnoise you dont hear cutoffmehmany any vocnoise like vocnoise like universal negative things about 
this vocnoise about the university ever iver yeah vocnoise i hear iver yeah its ridiculous 
i mean vocnoise plus its a nationally recognized school so a degree from ohio state 
vocnoise i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someones at least gonna recognize 
because its big vocnoise its big big name ashland itd be more of a sell 
id be like okay we its small its private its accredited vocnoise but still iver 
yeah its really expensive but thats why i went there for now i wouldnt go 
there it was actually my last choice vocnoise uh for universities but i went there 
vocnoise because the price laugh iver its in in education its its top they produce 
a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education vocnoise business school is coming up vocnoise 
like theyre building a new building but by the ill be gone by the time 
its done if i decide to stay vocnoise so its itll be vocnoise so vocnoise 
as far as uh education like for small school and they just opened up their 
phd program in education vocnoise and theyre also known for political science vocnoise but its 
a real conservative political science vocnoise its a real conservative school and that doesnt really 
match my vocnoise my views on a lot of things um like they its dry 
vocnoise they have uh vocnoise real strict visitation policies things like that vocnoise my thought 
is if youre vocnoise if youre if youre considered an adult enough to move away 
then you shouldnt have vocnoise that many restrictions i can understand some because vocnoise i 
remember when i was a freshman in college it was vocnoise we did crazy things 
but still iver oh yeah vocnoise yeah vocnoise very much so iver yeah its a 
vocnoise you can if youre if vocnoise you cant go to a girls dorm vocnoise 
until cutoffmmaybe cutoffmmaybe i think maybe the afternoon vocnoise i think maybe eleven im not 
sure vocnoise uh vocnoise but you have to be out by a certain time vocnoise 
uh its not as bad as like malone like i dont know if youve heard 
about malone they have like certain days so its not like that but vocnoise its 
still just a pain iver youre allowed to have guests of the same sex like 
it cutoffsehsays cutoffihit like vocnoise i dont live in the dorms but assuming i did 
if i cutoffwahwant if i had a girl come from home to visit me id 
have to vocnoise either sneak her in laugh and like just hope we didnt get 
caught or vocnoise have her stay at a friends iver like uh at a vocnoise 
girl friends of mine iver a lot a lot of people iver yeah yeah vocnoise 
so its kinda unknown and the university knows thats going on so iver they just 
vocnoise im not sure really what they do iver no this real like to live 
off campus vocnoise you have to well vocnoise after my class itll be twenty two 
and senior credit status vocnoise but my class was twenty one vocnoise or senior vocnoise 
or senior credit so i got to move off campus vocnoise but like had i 
been a year younger i wouldnt have been able to because they have to wait 
until twenty two vocnoise so theyre iver yeah youre not allowed iver no its very 
much so iver very much so because theres two thousand undergraduates vocnoise and basically eighteen 
hundred of them live on campus vocnoise and then if you live off campus like 
vocnoise id like to think i dont have trouble making friends but like that vocnoise 
but ive had friends get arrested by the police because vocnoise after ten thirty like 
the university vocnoise theres theyre vehicles they vocnoise of uh all the off campus sil 
kids to like vocnoise to the police vocnoise and so like vocnoise theyd start driving 
around around ten thirty try and bust them for noise vocnoise on the weekends vocnoise 
so vocnoise its pretty hectic iver yeah exactly thats what its a very conservative town 
and the iver and its a very vocnoise it seems to be a fairly conservative 
vocnoise uh cutoffuuniversity vocnoise university as well so iver yeah i think if i make 
the transfer ill definitely be happy about it iver definitely iver like sil politically is 
that what cutoffchyou vocnoise oh well like um vocnoise like i was in high school 
i was involved in like the democratic sil in the democratic campaign and vocnoise just 
stuff like that just vocnoise uh id like to do something noise vocnoise unknown sil 
i unknown vocnoise learning laughmore about the environment because this job vocnoise but id like 
to do something vocnoise otherwise like a vocnoise a lot of like vocnoise business leaders 
vocnoise uh vocnoise theyre very vocnoise they become very conservative when they get higher up 
because like the tax breaks they wanna support things like that vocnoise but i think 
there should be a good mix vocnoise like vocnoise uh cutoffththere sil there there could 
still be vocnoise like a think tank of vocnoise of executives that sil could be 
very liberal and theyre thinking and vocnoise just vocnoise you know for social vocnoise for 
social vocnoise not so much social change but vocnoise you know not vocnoise not um 
encouraging sweat shops within the corporations errorthustuff stuff like that and id like to cutoffgeget 
vocnoise i dont know how i would get involved in something like that but i 
would like to vocnoise itd be interesting iver that would be neat vocnoise thatd be 
real neat laugh but vocnoise thats sil dream world so iver i have to get 
a job and vocnoise support myself so iver thatll come later maybe when i retire 
vocnoise way iver way in the future iver vocnoise i dont know vocnoise i would 
like to think vocnoise id like to say no sitting here but you never know 
because vocnoise cutoffe vocnoise i guess thats cutoffi cause thats what happens to a lot 
of them yknow they cutoffbecobecome they come out of school all idealistic and then they 
go vocnoise into industry and then vocnoise theyre molded and vocnoise assuming they make upper 
management vocnoise cutoffyyou theres vocnoise you want the tax breaks you want vocnoise cutoffthingthings vocnoise 
you know what i mean and then vocnoise they uh vocnoise like i have an 
uncle whos a vice president on wall street vocnoise for merrill lynch and vocnoise he 
said vocnoise you know he vocnoise he got out of school he was very idealistic 
but vocnoise now vocnoise he vocnoise hes vocnoise hes like all those people they should 
sil you know id cutoffmmade vocnoise i made it through myself and hes not for 
like the vocnoise you know but vocnoise realistically he didnt vocnoise but iver you lose 
sight of that i think vocnoise you know what i mean and vocnoise lot of 
these guys become real vocnoise egotistical vocnoise i mean i like my uncle and everything 
but iver you know you know what i mean iver no not at all vocnoise 
i think vocnoise in the united states vocnoise its the driving force of our vocnoise 
of our sil of our government and vocnoise and even like vocnoise cause cutoffyyou vocnoise 
without without vocnoise a revenue base from the taxes vocnoise of corporations vocnoise the you 
couldnt have nearly the things that weve had vocnoise and i think vocnoise to a 
degree theyve become vocnoise fairly powerful but i dont think thats necessarily a bad thing 
vocnoise uh vocnoise when the unions were really strong i thought vocnoise like we were 
vocnoise i was reading about it i thought vocnoise that was a good thing as 
well because that supported cutoffththe vocnoise supported the person but you could vocnoise if you 
have good relations with your labor sil you dont necessarily need a union iver and 
a lot times unions vocnoise uh they errorakchisiyactually vocnoise actually seem detrimental vocnoise like vocnoise 
to production and vocnoise to like the actual individual needs of the members of the 
union vocnoise because vocnoise the if the union becomes powerful you can feel free to 
call off and vocnoise things like that and vocnoise like vocnoise that that can actually 
make it worse because then the corporation sees vocnoise these lazy a lazy union as 
representative sil of vocnoise of these workers so theyre more apt outside iver yeah i 
was cutoffw vocnoise i was driving by the vocnoise the honking and everything so yeah 
my roommates and i got into a sil a debate about it vocnoise but vocnoise 
it vocnoise we didnt really resolve it iver because noise conceivably they wanted vocnoise uh 
what was it a two dollar raise vocnoise or something vocnoise but vocnoise and then 
they also get free tuition but only vocnoise as i understand it only vocnoise a 
very small percentage get that free tuition vocnoise or like iver exercise that iver that 
cutoffriright iver yeah vocnoise like they all get the option but i cutoffffeel vocnoise i 
understand very few exercise it vocnoise so vocnoise you know if you were to not 
give them sil the the tuition that they could vocnoise that vocnoise most of them 
are using and then give them the two dollars an hour vocnoise you know vocnoise 
the but then vocnoise that could vocnoise then you could say that o s us 
helping to keep people down and so you have to still sil its a its 
an odd balance there vocnoise it is vocnoise and vocnoise like vocnoise uh its something 
like that doesnt seem too skilled to me so the i dont really know why 
theres much of a union for that but vocnoise yeah sil obviously the iver yeah 
it does its not like a skilled profession to me i think iver yeah the 
protection vocnoise iver um hum iver yeah theres no distinction iver oh they were helping 
out the the new laughguys iver oh yeah vocnoise but he has to still support 
the union so vocnoise yeah thats vocnoise thats a rough place to be in vocnoise 
but a vocnoise does the union like when people go on strike does the union 
help support the people that arent getting paid then or iver oh iver i see 
iver um hum iver really iver yeah yeah thats noise thats interesting iver really iver 
broke the vocnoise the vocnoise strike vocnoise if youre part of the union and you 
just decided to go back and say forget it sil they cant pay you vocnoise 
yeah and i dont see too many people working for free iver so vocnoise iver 
um vocnoise in general i extthink vocnoise i think vocnoise the united states has vocnoise 
sil a fairly well developed like class vocnoise not like sil class structure in which 
you cant move up or down vocnoise but like vocnoise we have a cutoffffairly sil 
a fairly large middle class iver um sector and i think thats a good sign 
vocnoise but i think vocnoise theres vocnoise a huge theres vocnoise millions of children that 
dont have any healthcare and thats not right theres vocnoise like vocnoise theres a lot 
of vocnoise like between the lower and the upper theres a huge disparity vocnoise but 
vocnoise at least its a step in the right direction we have a vocnoise a 
nice solid middle errorinclungincome sil middle cutoffincoincome sil unknown vocnoise middle income base i think 
vocnoise because a lot of countries only have the sil like vocnoise i visited mexico 
and vocnoise seems like they only had the distinction between vocnoise the upper and lower 
i mean their middle class is very small vocnoise and that uh but that economy 
is vocnoise coming along too and i mean it vocnoise itll be cutofff sil its 
developing itself which is vocnoise which is nice i took a tour of sil a 
plant down there vocnoise cause my my old vocnoise my old man had business down 
there so i went down vocnoise just to see it and vocnoise like vocnoise it 
it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better vocnoise granted 
those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day vocnoise but vocnoise they 
get cutoffsi they get bused into work because vocnoise none of them have cars vocnoise 
and then on top of that vocnoise they all get a meal vocnoise because vocnoise 
there vocnoise like vocnoise like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because 
vocnoise i was talking to the vocnoise the cutoffmmanager one of the managers and he 
said vocnoise if we dont do that sil then vocnoise they wont be thinking about 
the vocnoise our quality sil and vocnoise theyll be thinking about getting food and theyll 
be hungry so sil it hurts our quality vocnoise so for them it was worth 
it and i iver vocnoise id like to see that implemented something like that in 
the united states thatd be a neat thing vocnoise you know vocnoise because vocnoise like 
vocnoise i know like iron foundries and uh some like vocnoise like the lower paying 
jobs vocnoise like vocnoise they have people that are illiterate and things like that vocnoise 
and they cant vocnoise like give vocnoise paychecks out on thursdays because sil everyone will 
call off on fridays cause they all go out and get drunk or vocnoise i 
dont know what they do with their pay checks i know thats a extbig big 
problem iver but like if you said i well have a bus service well go 
and pick you guys up vocnoise you know and then then you cant use the 
excuse my car broke down or something vocnoise and then like if you unknown vocnoise 
even you give them a vocnoise like vocnoise doesnt even have to be a hot 
meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if youre on three shifts 
you can just vocnoise you know heres the box of donuts and some milk or 
something vocnoise you know that doesnt cost the company that much cutoffconcompared vocnoise iver compared 
to vocnoise you youll have more loyalty i would think sil and at the same 
time vocnoise those people wont be thinking about being hungry while theyre on the line 
vocnoise working for you iver so iver yeah exactly vocnoise you can bring that in 
house i think vocnoise i mean vocnoise i dont know i might go out like 
vocnoise like we said and vocnoise be sil completely wrong vocnoise so iver yeah iver 
yeah its a qualitative type cutoffahanalysis sil analysis iver exactly noise vocnoise iver yeah theyre 
very quantitative as opposed to like the quality vocnoise and then so vocnoise the analysis 
is all about bottom line and the numbers because vocnoise actually thats why i dont 
like vocnoise like i like business and i vocnoise i enjoy my business classes but 
vocnoise some of the people in my business classes i can not stand because they 
honestly theyre like vocnoise oh it doesnt matter how you treat people and then vocnoise 
its all about the bottom line well sil theyll cutoffenend vocnoise in my vocnoiseopinion theyll 
end up losing more because sil it costs a lot to hire a new employee 
vocnoise and if you have constant turnover things like extthat vocnoise then sil and if 
you have a product and sil that sil because obviously people arent gonna extcare vocnoise 
yknow vocnoise so noise vocnoise and they theyre they seem very closedminded like vocnoise like 
this is the way business has to extbe vocnoise but the professors dont seem to 
sil be necessarily like that vocnoise maybe im coming too far sil going to one 
extreme iver but the professors seem more cutoffcentercentered sil centered to me theyre like vocnoise 
you have to balance it which im sure is the truth vocnoise yknow you cant 
vocnoise diminish all your bottom line hesfor sil yknow making your workers noisefeel good but 
sil theres still something to it i think iver yeah noise iver laughexactly iver exactly 
iver laugh iver vocnoise see im not sure if universal health sil health care would 
be cutoffththe vocnoise hesthe sil the thing vocnoise hesuh sil i think it was vocnoise 
my freshman year vocnoise my sister and i went to vocnoise donna shale the hesuh 
iver the hesum vocnoise whitehouse like iver vocnoiseperson on vocnoise shes vocnoisepretty high up i 
guess i was cutoffununaware unaware iver yeah vocnoise she she had a talk and my 
sister and i attended and sil i dont like the problem i think with universal 
healthcare would be vocnoise everyone dont you think like everyone with the littlest scratch would 
go in vocnoise yknow cutoffaas sil as opposed hesto vocnoise like the very cutoffmu sil 
and cutoffnethat i think that could drive costs up vocnoise so there has to be 
a way to balance it im not sure how you would go about doing that 
vocnoise because you dont wanna vocnoiseput a limit and say okay you vocnoisecan only go 
three times a year iver because then yknow what if something major happens that fourth 
time then what vocnoise but vocnoise i vocnoisethink sil i at least for children especially 
because they have no extmeans sil to to help themselves vocnoise and like vocnoise the 
vocnoiseparents sil obviously sil even if theyre working a lot of times cant get healthcare 
for their children vocnoise so i think sil at least for children vocnoise because how 
many accidents happen to children like sil people are always sil breaking arms and stuff 
iver yknow and vocnoise without health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars vocnoise 
and they have no means to help themselves at least if you vocnoise assuming youre 
eighteen vocnoise you vocnoisecould get a job like sil and try and sil vocnoisepay for 
your health insurance i mean it im not saying itd be easy but still iver 
its more feasible than vocnoise a six year old iver yknow vocnoise so i think 
maybe vocnoise not universal health care but sil for children i think itd be helpful 
iver yeah cutoffexacexactly medicaid i think sil i think sil it cutoffiits iver its vocnoise 
theyre always synonymous but iver but theyre uh sil because theyre both government programs but 
yeah sil but i vocnoisethink sil like i said for the vocnoise for the younger 
people because vocnoise sil it is sil cutoffay because its not their fault their parents 
cant get sil vocnoisehealth sil health care sil so vocnoise sil laugh iver oh really 
iver vocnoise oh really vocnoise iver vocnoise oh i see sil well thatd be a 
good way i would think iver yeah yeah then cutoffthethere laughtheredbeno desire yeah iver yeah 
that seems good noise iver thats cool vocnoise iver laugh iver vocnoise yeah thats uh 
sil the the bureaucracy sil itd be too much of a struggle i think iver 
vocnoise yeah but if youre the first state in the union to do it vocnoise 
it cutoffcocost itll cost you extmillions and millions it would be rough it be so 
hard to iver noise i know exactly iver vocnoise you would vocnoisethink but vocnoise i 
dont know there has to be something like extwhy you know the first state cutoffthathat 
cutoffdodoes that does it vocnoise i mean cutoffaai i after cutofff one im sure others 
would follow suit vocnoise it after they see the vocnoisebenefits of it vocnoise but sil 
that first one sil i dont extknow iver and it would take cutofff like years 
i would think to implement the programs successfully sil iver vocnoise government doesnt seem to 
work too swiftly vocnoise iver laughnonotthat not that ive seen sil yknow iver extno because 
vocnoise honestly like vocnoise gore to me is like a vocnoisebest out of a bad 
bunch laughlike sil if i have to choose ill choose gore vocnoise but that doesnt 
mean i necessarily like vocnoise hes most in line with a lot of my cutoffstustuff 
sil with a lot of my views vocnoise cutoffnonow dont get me wrong im not 
vocnoise completely liberal on everything like theres vocnoise certain things i guess maybe vocnoise because 
going to school in ashland it just rubs off on you laughtherescertainthingslike vocnoise im not 
so liberal about but vocnoise i dont really sil like gore just seems so dry 
and just not vocnoise its hard to sil i vocnoisethink itd be hard to get 
people enthusiastic for him iver no not at all i wouldve rather voted for extmccain 
sil vocnoise over bush vocnoise because vocnoise bush sil heshe sil he comes from a 
political family which im not saying is wrong because the kennedys were a big sil 
political family vocnoise but im saying like bush is um vocnoise he just seems like 
sil he didnt really sil like cutoffih everythings been handed to him in life sil 
hesand vocnoise hesuh vocnoise the issue of like whether he did drugs not that thats 
a big issue but i dont like the way he addressed it vocnoise yknow that 
to me vocnoise vocnoisejust vocnoise if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try 
or make a mistake vocnoise but the way hes handling it saying im not even 
gonna dignify that question over and over and over vocnoise if he didnt do it 
he might as well just be like no i didnt do it iver yknow because 
then what does he have to hide vocnoise and then vocnoise like the fact that 
he didnt know sil like i vocnoisethink in international policy hell be struggling if he 
becomes president vocnoise he didnt know the vocnoise vocnoisethree leaders of the world vocnoise thing 
and then on top of it like vocnoise texas is a fairly big economy but 
still like vocnoise to manage an entire yknow sil an entire economy iver i cutoffththink 
iver yeah sil and that sil like sil i vocnoisedontknow cutoffthathat that states notorious for 
killing people i think they killed someone last night iver extso vocnoise that to me 
is laughvery vocnoise like sil thats ridiculous like the governor he couldve made a stay 
or yknow what i mean vocnoise and theyve openly admitted that theyve killed people vocnoise 
that sil were found to be innocent later iver yeah vocnoise and its like number 
one in the union and thats like vocnoise such a disturbing fact to me that 
you could take someones life and be like vocnoise oh our bad vocnoise that person 
was innocent vocnoise yknow iver cutoffthathat iver definitely vocnoise i definitely vocnoise the way i 
feel sil the death vocnoisepenaltys wrong vocnoise but hesuh vocnoise i dont know vocnoisepeople are 
always like oh you know if your mother cutoffihif if your mother was killed god 
forbid vocnoise but like you would want the death penalty but vocnoise honestly i dont 
think i would vocnoise i really like id feel angry towards that person but vocnoise 
killing them doesnt vocnoise help extme sil with hesmy maybe the families say it helps 
with closure and everything but vocnoise i cutoffeh that to me hesis vocnoise its displacing 
my anger in a way that sil actually i dont think vocnoise hesthe vocnoise my 
victim that i was so close to me would want me to do vocnoise yknow 
sil so iver vocnoise iver vocnoise well like vocnoise im a philosophy minor hesso sil 
like vocnoise if you look at like different sil ethical theories and stuff heslike sil 
cutoffyoyou sil like theres a hierarchy kind of vocnoise this is what ive found sil 
theres a hierarchy of vocnoise things that are sil uh sil like the inalienable rights 
for instance vocnoise like vocnoise i cant sil if you come into my house vocnoise 
and rob me sil and then run outside sil extim noisenotgonna i cutoffdondont vocnoise like 
sil to kill you for stealing my property sil like theres a hierarchy there vocnoise 
uh for stealing another life thats why people say oh you can do it so 
vocnoise but i really feel like vocnoise theres nothing vocnoise like sil if i if 
its inalienable the definition is vocnoise its not sil able to be taken not even 
by yourself thats why you cant commit suicide vocnoise and since its the highest thing 
because without it you cant even do the others vocnoise its so it naturally has 
to be higher ordered than the others because vocnoise without that you cant do the 
vocnoise you cant be sil ethical in any other extway vocnoise so sil that has 
to be the highest thing sil and if its sil inalienable because sil i didnt 
give it to you sil i cant take it back vocnoise you never sil forfeited 
that sil you never gave me that right vocnoise extso vocnoise thats why i feel 
like vocnoise i could extnever sil want that in cutoffa sil to kill another person 
or cutoffananything iver well yeah cutoffuhunder sil under certain cutoffccircumstances iver yeah well cutoffitits iver 
vocnoise uh we took hesum sil uh i took hesuh sil military ethics vocnoise as 
a philosophy course vocnoise and that was really interesting because even though in sil even 
in that hierarchy vocnoise theres still certain contexts within the context of war for instance 
vocnoise if sil if we both extknow if we knowingly go into it as combatants 
sil and cutoffwerwere sil were fighting for sil whatever cause but if we both vocnoise 
are willingly going into it vocnoise and we know that the result could be death 
vocnoise then vocnoise like vocnoise and it vocnoise and its vocnoise an erroragressinagression sil an 
aggression thing one side will be the aggressor one would vocnoise obviously vocnoise because you 
cant have two vocnoise uh vocnoise two aggressive things vocnoise uh uh vocnoise naturally one 
would be aggressive sil and then one would vocnoise be aggressive in its response vocnoise 
you cant you know what i mean vocnoise so in like a state of war 
sil it was like that so vocnoise cutoffm vocnoise in that context i think vocnoise 
but like sil in the same context vocnoise i feel itd be wrong for a 
soldier to kill a civilian because vocnoise they didnt vocnoise um they didnt decide to 
become a combatant vocnoise so if youre an vocnoise if youre a combatant and you 
make that decision vocnoise or your drafted which vocnoise that vocnoise that is kind of 
like making the decision in the sense that you are part of that society that 
got you drafted vocnoise so if you choose to be part of that society vocnoise 
that vocnoise i mean thats a little shadier if vocnoise but still if youre vocnoise 
if you both make the vocnoise the desire to do it then vocnoise so vocnoise 
like if i were drafted i think i would fight im sure i would fight 
for the country or vocnoise you know vocnoise but vocnoise i dont think i would 
go sil extlike you know vocnoise i just dont feel the need to go vocnoise 
on a laughrampageoranything iver laugh iver well i mean vocnoise to me the whole thing 
is wrong regardless of if vocnoise youre guilty or innocent vocnoise there to me theres 
errorworthworse cutoffthithings worse things vocnoise i would think than vocnoise than dying you know vocnoise 
cutoffyyou you vocnoise like i know in israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin vocnoise 
he got locked up sil and hes not allowed to see cutoffe sil uh because 
uh sil um vocnoise under jewish law vocnoise you cant kill iver for that for 
vocnoise for that so vocnoise he he got locked up and hes not allowed to 
see another human being iver like they have this they have like vocnoise unknown two 
doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and 
then he opens vocnoise and like vocnoise could you imagine cutofff vocnoise like iver no 
sunlight vocnoise you know sil the and cutoffiit they dont give him they keep it 
warm vocnoise and hes not allowed sheets or razors vocnoise or vocnoise you know other 
than electric razors so he cant kill himself vocnoise so youre just stuck cutoffyyou theres 
nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies 
vocnoise and that to me would be vocnoise like that to me is actually like 
vocnoise that has to be worse vocnoise noiselike vocnoise just the agony and the vocnoise 
and the i think youd have to go insane like theres only so much you 
vocnoisecan vocnoise id ask for board games or something but like he cutoffcacant vocnoise doesnt 
even hear a human voice vocnoise because cutoffwah vocnoise i think its something like that 
was written in the scriptures like vocnoise youre dead to the world for sil uh 
cutoffiis sil is the worse that you can do and so vocnoise the world vocnoise 
sees him sil you know what i mean vocnoise so thatd be extrough sil thatd 
be real rough and vocnoise so obviously he would want to um vocnoise i would 
like they say like now like people that observe him hes like sings to himself 
and he vocnoise reads the bible like sil everyday vocnoiseand vocnoise but like i dont 
know thatd be extstrange vocnoise be such a horrible thing to go through i couldnt 
imagine being locked in a room for vocnoiselike vocnoise few days iver like that sil 
like solitary vocnoise but like unlimited solitary that vocnoisedoesnt seem right either but iver yeah 
like its just unknown its killing its own citizens its so vocnoiseridiculous iver yeah iver 
yeah exactly iver if you just look at the nature of what theyre doing its 
just iver inherently wrong to me iver yeah exactly thatll laughsolvetheproblem iver thats just its 
ridiculous iver laugh iver you can get in huge arguments people like no youre lying 
because if your mother died or someone close to you died you would want them 
dead vocnoise and honestly vocnoise i can honestly say i would not want that to 
happen to them iver you know iver people cant cutoffunderstaunderstand iver they cant fathom that 
iver exactly iver laugh vocnoise they cannot understand where youre coming from iver laugh iver 
yeah not not for special conditions laughnothing just universally its wrong iver yeah thats what 
it is vocnoise its a marketing thing iver maybe at the vocnoise under lying base 
iver laugh exactly laugh iver thats ridiculous its like barbarism to me like vocnoise ugh 
iver yeah and were laughoneofthem laugh texas is supporting strong they have like iver i 
forget they have the vocnoise like way more than like they dwarf any other state 
i think so vocnoise that to me is not sil thats not admirable and then 
i cutoffwouwould cutoffai vocnoise so the vocnoise vocnoisethats one reason i wouldnt vote for bush 
iver laugh plus i dont really feel like the vocnoiserepublicanpartyrepresents vocnoise the vocnoisepopulace at a 
whole like at their laughlast political convention like vocnoise in uh vocnoise the last presidential 
election in ninety six vocnoise they said one in ten of the delegates that were 
sil attending the convention were millionaires vocnoise now granted i know more than ten people 
and not cutoffwone vocnoise you know what i noisemean noise noisesotomei noise just feel vocnoiselike 
noise thats not a good representation iver yeah vocnoise yeah iver they vocnoise they definitely 
struggle sil it sil they do some vocnoise i i think vocnoise to be that 
high up vocnoise obviously vocnoise youre gonna come in contact with powerful vocnoisepeoplerich people and 
vocnoise things like that but vocnoise i think at least even if the democrats vocnoise 
do have that same vocnoise thing they seem to keep more in mind vocnoisethe vocnoise 
i dont know i dont think they represent vocnoise working class vocnoise you know vocnoise 
guy either but vocnoise at least more so than the vocnoiserepublicans vocnoise so like i 
said best out of a bad bunch id probably iver yeah vocnoise laughithink so vocnoise 
i think so vocnoise and like vocnoise they just cutoffddont neither of the candidates really 
seem like they have that much integrity vocnoise me you know vocnoise so iver laugh 
iver i have no idea i remember where i was too when the columbine shooting 
because like vocnoise my friends and i were sitting around drinking a few vocnoisebeers and 
vocnoise you know were channel surfing vocnoise and you know we see that kid fall 
out of the window and were like oh my god what is going on so 
sil we just left it on and vocnoise it was quite vocnoise cutoffeyz like it 
was disturbing because sil i unknown vocnoise like i was recently out of high school 
myself and like sure there were fights and stuff laughbutitwasalways like you could avoid them 
or vocnoise know what i mean iver vocnoise but now it seems like people are 
just vocnoise like vocnoise i dont know why thats a trend i mean vocnoise my 
dad said vocnoise uh he grew up in the bronx iver and vocnoise he said 
even in the when he was in high school that they had sil they had 
police officers there so thats not like a new thing vocnoise but he said vocnoise 
youd have people with like knives and youd have people with fist fights but you 
sil like guns was unheard of sil you know and i think vocnoise i dont 
know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh vocnoise theyre vocnoise 
people feel dejected vocnoise in high school im sure of it vocnoise you know vocnoise 
like vocnoise i dont i cutoffwaswasnt i didnt feel that way sil but vocnoise id 
like vocnoise in retrospect i look back and i thought sil you know im thinking 
maybe those people really felt like horrible and like vocnoise if every day was like 
extso traumatizing to them vocnoise like thatd be so like for four years every day 
youre just like extteased or sil something like horrible and you vocnoise like no one 
talks to you vocnoise im not vocnoise justifying what they do at all vocnoise but 
im saying vocnoise that would make them more sil that would probably in their mind 
give them the reason iver to say you know what im sick of this im 
gonna shoot those vocnoisepeople vocnoise but vocnoise i iver yeah i mean getting a gun 
doesnt cutoffseseem i mean i was surprised like vocnoise cutoffai vocnoise i would ive never 
owned a gun vocnoise but sil vocnoiseim vocnoise i think its pretty easy to get 
one laughactually iver yeah so vocnoise yeah and a lot people turn eighteen when theyre 
in high school so vocnoise vocnoiseim sure they can vocnoise go get one there iver 
laugh vocnoise thats just ridiculous too laughthough vocnoise but vocnoise yeah thats to me thats 
really weird vocnoise i dont like i said i dont know what theyre cutoffthithinking sil 
cutoffththe what theyre thinking vocnoise it vocnoiseorwhat their thought process was but vocnoise im thinking 
maybe vocnoise it the social because a lot vocnoise to me a high school is 
real social iver and like the social aspects of it were vocnoisethe problem noise so 
iver like i know uh like i was a vocnoise four year member of student 
council and like did that cutoffdidid went that route in high school vocnoise and i 
know we always tried to involve other people vocnoise but like they would look at 
us and be like thats so lame i would never do it iver so like 
vocnoise its like vocnoise you had these warring like vocnoise two different camps the vocnoise 
you know the camp that gets enthusiastic and vocnoise and thats where i was and 
then theres the other camp and im sure they have vocnoise their own sil hierarchy 
their whole structure and like vocnoise you know they do things their way vocnoise iver 
while cutoffsaysaying while poohpoohing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff vocnoise vocnoiseas vocnoise 
as far as bringing the two together like vocnoise socially sil i think thats just 
a rough age iver you know because cutoffyiyou vocnoise youre learning more about yourself vocnoise 
and uh sil youre cutoffalalso youre also learning more about vocnoise like youre vocnoiseexperiencing a 
lot of freedoms that you didnt have obviously sil you know vocnoise youre driving vocnoise 
vocnoise you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so 
vocnoise i really dont know how to how sil how they would go about doing 
that perhaps vocnoise like i know we used to have like uh vocnoise we had 
sil like the administrators actually allowed us to have vocnoise ah sil a day where 
vocnoise everyone like the whole class vocnoise as vocnoisea class could go have a picnic 
vocnoise like in the practice football field and that was cool because vocnoise everyone got 
along those days vocnoisebecause you didnt have to go to class you know you spent 
the second half the day vocnoisejust vocnoise hanging out and so everyone got along that 
way and i think that would be a start sil you know vocnoise but then 
vocnoise that hurts vocnoise the cutofff vocnoise the cutoffaadministration sil the administrators in a sense 
that sil theyre there to provide an errorediceducation sil education vocnoise so vocnoise itd be 
rough vocnoise in like my high school sil they sil they put up extcameras vocnoiseandtheyhadlike 
vocnoise they locked extbathrooms vocnoiselike at certain times you couldnt go in them and vocnoise 
like it was getting sil and they had like we were on the front page 
the akron beacon journal vocnoise because they had a lock down where vocnoise no one 
was allowed to leave their classroom vocnoise and then vocnoise they brought this vocnoise the 
dogs extthrough vocnoiseand vocnoise they found sil i was surprised they found a lot of 
drugs iver and sil i wasnt real vocnoise i was more surprised that they found 
a lot of cutoffllike vocnoise vocnoiselike sil alcohol like i wouldnt vocnoise like vocnoise you 
know like some people vocnoise if they do drugs at school and stuff vocnoise im 
not saying thats right but vocnoise theyll vocnoise theyll do it but like sil alcohol 
itd be so hard to like hide because it laughsmells you know and you laughgotta 
hold it out but they found like bottles of extliquor and vocnoise iver stuff like 
that and i think they even might have found like one or two vocnoiseguns vocnoise 
so vocnoise and that to me was vocnoise sil but my high school is two 
thousand people so i guess vocnoise by sheer numbers vocnoise one or two persons would 
bring a gun iver um sil its considered vocnoise urban vocnoise but because its north 
of akron we play vocnoiselike vocnoise a lot of like vocnoise the sil inner city 
like in akron schools vocnoise but in my opinion its suburbia vocnoise like vocnoise but 
we have the we have the big city problems like vocnoise theres a lot unknown 
drugs sil and cutoffiit i think thats just because vocnoise the buildings old so no 
one really takes pride vocnoisein it vocnoise and then sil its two vocnoisethousand people iver 
so that vocnoise like the just the sheer numbers of it i think iver i 
cutoffthithink i heswould like if you had to ask id say i was a straight 
cutoffmmid mid western suburbanite sil but vocnoise there are people that i go to school 
with vocnoise and ashland is twenty five thousand vocnoise like sil in the city iver 
and they vocnoise they say thats a city sil and vocnoise my school vocnoise or 
cutoffmmy vocnoise where i grew up was vocnoise more than double that sil just over 
double that it was like sixty thousand iver and iver cuyahoga falls iver and to 
me thats considered suburbia vocnoise so vocnoise and to me ashland is considered the sticks 
i mean vocnoise theres cutoffpeoppeople theres amish buggies that go by iver but like to 
some people thats considered a city so i think its youre perspective vocnoiseinthat sense iver 
for fun vocnoise weve been playing a lot of pool iver a laughlotof pool sil 
actually vocnoise uh we go to a bar vocnoise called the outrinn sil because its 
cheap and sil its fun there iver uh vocnoise outrinn vocnoise is over vocnoise i 
dont even know laughlike iver laugh i know how to get to it like the 
way we walk but i dont know what street its on iver yeah its real 
cutoffwawalking its like the one of the closest bars and we go there because they 
have a huge patio vocnoise and so you can just sit out and vocnoise talk 
and vocnoise and then uh we play a lot of board games lately too vocnoise 
like we just bought axis and allies me and my roommates iver so its really 
weird because uh iver its its kind of a fun game sil its just strange 
because vocnoise uh sil like sil were on cutoffsesemesters vocnoise i came down in semesters 
so there was still a month vocnoise where everyone was down here sil and now 
theres like vocnoise nobody down here so its vocnoise myself vocnoise my two roommates and 
maybe sil a handful of like vocnoise other people that we know vocnoise so it 
like vocnoise the social aspects like sil is vocnoise has diminished a lot vocnoise but 
that still i mean for fun we uh vocnoise play a lot of video games 
do like i guess youd think errorthikelike the natural vocnoise like vocnoise things you would 
expect from a college guy iver go out iver try and hit on girls that 
doesnt work that type of laughthing iver yeah just get out there and have fun 
vocnoise and then like we lift vocnoise uh probably like four days a week i 
know i dont look like it but laugh vocnoise but i go with them and 
have a vocnoisegood time vocnoise so iver yeah yeah its uh right around here like 
vocnoiseyeah iver its like down the hill kind of by the cutoffhorseshhorseshoe vocnoise yeah vocnoise 
yeah so thats where we go vocnoise and vocnoise i dont have a student i 
d so i just sneak in but its the summer they dont even care vocnoise 
they never iver i look like a college student that would go here so vocnoise 
ive never had a problem vocnoise so we go and vocnoisedo that vocnoise and like 
were planning a road trip were vocnoise we vocnoise were not we havent decided were 
thinking atlantic city vocnoise or uh sil florida vocnoise or new york city sil vocnoiseor 
vocnoise cutoffnnew sil new orleans those the choices were trying to narrow it down iver 
i know laughthoseare exthauls iver yeah vocnoisebut sil you know iver when else vocnoise cutoffihat 
cutoffihat sil at this point in my life when else would i be able to 
do vocnoiseit so iver laugh sil iver uh maybe vocnoise maybe i like i said 
like vocnoise its really weird vocnoise cutoffemmost most people make fun of me for still 
wearing detroit hats and being a detroit fan because ive lived in ohio for so 
long vocnoise but vocnoise when youre little is when cutoffyihyou vocnoise i think you learn 
loyalty like i love the sil old detroit tigers from the eighties vocnoise and like 
vocnoise thats when i learned vocnoise to like iver baseball like i collected baseball cards 
vocnoise i lived in detroit and so thats why it like stuck with me vocnoise 
so like i uh i remember when i had my tonsils out sil in third 
grade like youre allowed to bring one item because like youre a little kid vocnoise 
to like make you feel better vocnoise and i brought my detroit tigers hat so 
noiselike noise laughandlike i i cutoffowulonly like ill only wear detroit or boston and boston 
just because i cutoffllived vocnoise vocnoisei uh was born there vocnoise but sil and like 
people make fun of me theyre like you know because detroits horrible theyre in last 
place iver theyre like why dont you pitch vocnoise you know be happy for the 
indians im like im vocnoisehappy for them thats fine but iver oh yeah vocnoise yeah 
iver oh you get your laughchoicekindof sil well thats iver yeah yeah laugh equal distance 
iver laugh theyre definitely vocnoise i thought theyd be a lot vocnoisebetter vocnoise they got 
they picked up vocnoise ken griffey and then on top of it vocnoise they cutoffwewere 
cutoffhahad they were good without him vocnoise and now they picked him up and they 
seem to be cutoffdoidoing they still struggling im like vocnoise i dont understand that sil 
yeah but the indians are horrible right now sil i like i watched a game 
yesterday vocnoise and noise they were cutoffs vocnoise i think they were few days ago 
seven and a half games back from the chicago whitesox vocnoise we watched the game 
yesterday and vocnoise i dont know if we have a lot of injuries or anything 
vocnoisebecause i dont really follow the indians but vocnoise the cutoffai like i couldnt even 
recognize like that many of the names iver like vocnoise to me that was very 
strange iver yeah laugh thats thats pretty much out there iver yeah they definitely have 
the sticks vocnoise definitely sil yeah they vocnoise the vocnoise the big sticks are definitely 
sil vocnoiseon those two teams iver it seems that way i dont know why that 
is vocnoise you know in the eighties vocnoise they had vocnoise a lot of games 
were like vocnoise one to two sil you know unknown shutouts stuff like that vocnoise 
now i mean vocnoise he vocnoise my roommate was telling me the yankees beat someone 
twenty one to something the other day iver and thats ridiculous sil thats laughamazing to 
me iver i know yeah i know its ridiculous im just vocnoise i find that 
just vocnoisecrazy iver yeah it dilutes vocnoise theres theres only so much talent so it 
dilutes it iver and that that makes sense sil and a lot of the new 
ballparks are made smaller vocnoise so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans 
people go nuts vocnoise people would rather see a vocnoise tight game that was like 
vocnoise seven to like six vocnoise rather than watch like uh vocnoise a two to 
one ball game iver because thats more boring iver yeah vocnoise yeah iver yeah yeah 
exactly last three outs everyones like yeah lets hope he does it but until then 
youre like vocnoise okay this is ridiculous iver yeah iver laugh iver all right iver 
no vocnoise no i think laughimallright iver excludenonotatall noise iver iver yes iver umhum sil

sil laugh iver yeah sil i think it is further east than sil where i 
was i was right in the ural mountains so its like the sil border of 
europe and asia iver umhum it was pretty laughfarout vocnoise the city actually had a 
million people cutoffin that i lived in most of the time vocnoise but it was 
vocnoise the government that ran it actually was still sil um sil vocnoise communist sil 
iver they werent theyre not really sil acting sil they are the government there sil 
but vocnoise they cutoffsstill sil its just all so messed up it doesnt really matter 
whos iver the laughgovernment laugh vocnoise its whoever wants to laughbe iver um it was 
just sil yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem sil they just take 
over everything and they sil they dont pay their workers and vocnoise most people arent 
mafia so they sil dont get paid laugh vocnoise iver umhum sil yeah this was 
cutoffaabout sil vocnoise three years ago vocnoise about three years ago in august itll be 
three vocnoise sil and sil yeah it was vocnoise however many vocnoise was that in 
eighty nine or ninety or something like that vocnoise well sil its vocnoise it gets 
more and more sil um sil like cutoffaamerica sil its not like america vocnoise but 
sil more and more like a cutoffrregular sil regular democracy every year vocnoise i mean 
vocnoise not really but sil its closer and closer laugh sil a little bit vocnoise 
iver it cutoffwwasnt sil it wasnt easy sil and sil at first it was probably 
a lot harder vocnoise then after youve been there sil for about six months and 
you start to just get used to things sil but sil i sil i took 
for granted sil coming to cutoffameriamerica coming back here was iver vocnoise it was so 
amazing to be sil back in laughamerica laugh iver seeing all the sil nice things 
just vocnoise cutoffeeverywhere sil cutoffeeverywhere sil everywhere its just sil i couldnt believe it vocnoise 
but now its hesits easy to take it for granted again just vocnoise oh im 
back home laugh vocnoise iver well i was sil with sil um sil im sil 
vocnoise mormon so vocnoise we i dont know if you have ever seen how sil 
they go two by two always and vocnoise i was with what we call another 
sister i was sil and we would live in an apartment sil and sil vocnoise 
we vocnoise would pay for our own mission and vocnoise there was a mission president 
sil and they had different people sil with responsibilities sil leaders and vocnoise they would 
watch over you and make sure yknow call in the sil every night and check 
on you but sil it was really vocnoise up to us what we wanted to 
do we were vocnoise wed get up sil leave at nine thirty and sil be 
home by sil nine thirty or whenever it got dark iver and vocnoise we could 
do sil what we wanted laugh iver yeah iver i mean we had goals certain 
things that sil like we sil we had a set sil where wed like to 
do four hours of service every week iver wed sil like teach vocnoise english to 
little kids or sil or help clean or sil work at libraries or sil different 
things vocnoise iver oh wow iver oh did you really iver umhum sil iver it 
might have been where the president lived vocnoise they sometimes have like a mission home 
iver yeah iver laugh iver especially the guys laughyeah vocnoise iver just iver yeah we 
had um sil any sil not really just sil modest dresses you couldnt wear pants 
vocnoise and it cutoffwouwould vocnoise dresses couldnt be ankle length vocnoise they couldnt be sil 
um at the knee sil had to be mid cutoffcacalf mid cutoffknknee sil mid sil 
knee sil or whatever that is calf sil laugh vocnoise and that was vocnoise sil 
certain restrictions but yeah i mean basically just modest noise whatever sil i mean i 
wear sil boots with a dress in laughrussiabut iver i dont think youd do that 
here laugh iver i think so yeah like their haircuts are a certain way and 
vocnoise cant sil you have to shave and vocnoise um you always have to have 
your tie sil and sil your jacket if you can sil unless its really hot 
sil theres cutoffdidifferent its different sil also depending on the climate iver some places youre 
allowed to wear sandals sil and iver right iver yeah vocnoise laughno laugh iver right 
vocnoise iver just cutofftto sil i think its uh noise a cutoffrreflection to reflect vocnoise 
the sil the sil uh um sil beliefs sil that sil were trying to cutoffshshow 
carry and vocnoise and vocnoise sil because vocnoise i think if someone showed up and 
looking like sil i mean im not saying that its terrible it but if they 
had like a nose ring and all this stuff vocnoise then sil it sil vocnoise 
somebody might sil hesnot sil believe that they have anything credible to say vocnoise and 
sil a lot of times if youre dressed sil more respectfully that to vocnoise yknow 
sil i mean most the people will accept you vocnoise if youre dressed vocnoise in 
a dress vocnoise whereas sil i mean even a person in a nose ring will 
cutofftatalk vocnoise will respect you but vocnoise but then youre in a vocnoise youre at 
a cutofflloss disadvantage if you dont laugh dress in a certain way iver yeah iver 
right they look at sil more what you have to say then sil your clothes 
and that that was cutoffa sil something i remember them talking about too vocnoise you 
dont want them to look at what youre unknown sil what youre wearing vocnoise and 
sil thats mostly vocnoise that was a good sil thing for the dress code just 
vocnoise iver well not really they uh have a lot of vocnoise um sil religious 
beliefs sil on their own that theyve had held on to because vocnoise um they 
have just have had nothing iver unknown they werent even allowed to cutoffhahave believe in 
god iver right vocnoise so a lot of them already believe and that sil they 
have their own religion vocnoise and they vocnoise theyre really faithful vocnoise so that was 
the cutoffmmain one of the main problems is that they sil um sil they had 
been so sil holding on to that for so vocnoise long and its so strong 
vocnoise they dont wanna sil let go of vocnoise what and then the men sil 
their problem was usually that they would drink a lot sil and iver so vocnoise 
the it vocnoise sil it was hard to talk to drunk people laugh iver umhum 
iver yeah theyre russian orthodox sil same sil basically same thing vocnoise iver yeah i 
dont even know what their sil holidays are vocnoise i sil i dont know sil 
iver umhum iver like cutoffcatholcatholic sil vocnoisecatholcatholicism sil oh from mormons vocnoise well sil our 
basic vocnoise um sil real fundamental belief is that sil the church that the sil 
russians believed in at one time was sil the true church and that it was 
vocnoise um sil the sil the same church that christ set up sil when he 
was on the earth vocnoise with the twelve apostles and vocnoise and but the sil 
vocnoise after christ died that vocnoise the sil authority vocnoise was taken from the earth 
vocnoise to sil um have those sil apostles and to sil have the sil the 
church set up like it was vocnoise and sil it cutoffwwas sil must have been 
really strong because its still lasted all the same catholic and cutofforthoorthodox all the orthodox 
churches still carry unknown all these beliefs vocnoise sil but sil vocnoise our belief is 
that vocnoise it didnt sil it vocnoise sil it needed to be restored vocnoise cutoffanand 
vocnoise and we believe i dont know if youve heard about joseph smith vocnoise or 
iver vocnoise well we believe that sil um sil that revelation vocnoise that was there 
on earth vocnoise was vocnoise actually restored vocnoise again and vocnoise through joseph smith because 
he vocnoise had sil a desire in his heart to know what was true and 
he prayed vocnoise and he actually had a vision where he saw sil god and 
vocnoise jesus christ vocnoise and i know this is all really sil i mean this 
is like deep doctrine stuff but vocnoise and um vocnoise and he was told that 
there were cutoffnahnone vocnoise none of the churches on the sil earth were true vocnoise 
that sil vocnoise some of them had good things but they sil their um vocnoise 
they werent exactly hitting the mark iver and sil that sil cutoffiit vocnoise it was 
gonna about to be restored again vocnoise and so we believe that the true church 
is actually restored again to the earth iver and it was through joseph smith and 
he translated vocnoise the book of mormon sil with vocnoise help from god vocnoise and 
so thats basically it vocnoise i mean the book of mormon is sil a counterpart 
to the bible sil its a vocnoise its sil from vocnoise prophets that lived in 
america vocnoise iver so you knew youve heard about that probably iver oh okay iver 
unknown iver its easy sil to cutoffforforget laugh iver umhum vocnoise it cutoffiis its sil 
its american in the vocnoise from the fact that its vocnoise um vocnoise it was 
written by vocnoise native americans sil and sil and um sil unknown sil and joseph 
smith was an american vocnoise and he was sil used to vocnoise to translate it 
so it is vocnoise and it its actually funny though but errortheresttheres sil more members 
of the church that live outside of america iver its vocnoise gotten to the point 
where theres sil theres sil more than five million outside iver less in america then 
cutoffthethere laugh iver thats exactly what it laughiis laugh iver vocnoise yeah iver oh unknown 
there was a lot of discouraging things sil just vocnoise i mean vocnoise i learned 
so much sil vocnoise it cutoffwwasnt and it wasnt always just people rejecting you that 
was discouraging because that was kind of funny at times iver people would sil erroryounyoud 
errordockknock on the door and they would erroryeyalyell vocnoise yell that they werent home or 
something and iver and so vocnoise it was kind of funny but sil but the 
vocnoise discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that dont have any 
vocnoise hope and iver they get so sil cutoffs vocnoise theyre just so poor and 
they vocnoise and sil and you cutoffffeel i cutoffffelt sil cutoffwewell vocnoise we felt sometimes 
like vocnoise we could help them but sil they didnt want any vocnoise help and 
vocnoise it was kind of hard to sil just sil say okay well vocnoise i 
did what i could and iver i mean vocnoise not saying that they had to 
believe what we believe but just vocnoise even just sil the their attitude about life 
was so vocnoise down and iver yeah vocnoise they were just so vocnoise iver there 
was other things vocnoise right yeah vocnoise like we had our service wed clean up 
sil neighborhoods or vocnoise yeah there was a lot of different things iver umhum iver 
no i think they liked that sil it cutoffwawas it was really funny because here 
if you went into a vocnoise a vocnoise school or something and said vocnoise we 
wanna vocnoise help sil we wanna teach a class vocnoise or iver we wanna clean 
or anything vocnoise they would probably say sil yknow they might think it was kind 
of weird but they vocnoise would vocnoise let you vocnoise yknow vocnoise but they would 
be like you wanna do this and we dont have any money to pay you 
sil oh but we dont vocnoise yknow we dont want money thats the whole point 
were cutoffsserving iver we wanted to serve you vocnoise mm they cutoffv they didnt get 
that at all laugh vocnoise they were like vocnoise laugh some people would just be 
like no no way it doesnt make sense laugh iver probably a little bit iver 
umhum iver there is yeah iver itd be a lot more accepted i think here 
vocnoise even though it might be kind of vocnoise i wouldnt do that um sil 
on my own but vocnoise if im vocnoise i felt like vocnoise that was what 
i was doing all the time so laugh vocnoise full time iver vocnoise iver oh 
vocnoise laughyeah laugh iver i think sil the vocnoise one of the things that we 
sil when when youre baptized is that vocnoise sil youre really vocnoise supposed to vocnoise 
help other people to vocnoise cutoffna vocnoise like if vocnoise if cutoffyiyou somebody gives you 
a gift you wanna give it to someone else vocnoise but its sil easy a 
lot of times just to fall into the vocnoise yknow like vocnoise mold of vocnoise 
not letting anyone know what you believe and vocnoise just sil so that they vocnoise 
think well what are those weirdos yknow they dont wear makeup or whatever but we 
cutoffwewear sil we can wear makeup if we want laugh vocnoise but sil so vocnoise 
i think vocnoise unknown a lot of times people do fall in vocnoise to sort 
of vocnoise but i vocnoise i was not raised sil mormon so vocnoise i have 
a lot of sil my family and friends who are still not members of the 
church vocnoise and sil also because its so new to me that vocnoise i vocnoise 
am just sil yknow i will talk about it with anybody and vocnoise and vocnoise 
and so vocnoise and im also sil not afraid of people who arent mormons because 
i think if you grow up like vocnoise a member of the church and vocnoise 
you might be cutoffafafraid vocnoise more afraid of people vocnoise that dont sil believe like 
youve been taught vocnoise i think sil a lot of the vocnoise yknow vocnoise we 
dont vocnoise drink alcohol we dont sil theres a lot of restrictions vocnoise i guess 
you call them restrictions but theyre vocnoise cutoffelhealth vocnoise i feel like theyre more vocnoise 
just health codes vocnoise just keep you healthy and vocnoise so vocnoise um sil it 
might be vocnoise its like if we cutoffwu sil extif vocnoise america vocnoise yknow were 
vocnoise were used to being raised one way if we went to another country just 
kind of like vocnoise you might wanna get to know the chinese people but vocnoise 
you might not quite vocnoise be a little timid about sil yknow errorstamesame kind of 
thing sil but vocnoise i vocnoise im not i dont have any of those barriers 
iver since ive been vocnoise on both vocnoise worlds laugh iver well vocnoise and iver 
and it really isnt though because sil once vocnoise sil because sil i think its 
actually its really freeing not to have to drink and vocnoise all these things so 
you just kinda sil i feel like i can get along with any vocnoise people 
vocnoise and vocnoise so it doesnt really exclude you from anyone vocnoise unless you would 
vocnoise let it i guess vocnoise and nobodys sil perfect i mean everybody has their 
prejudices i guess and fears so vocnoise getting over that is a vocnoise is vocnoise 
part of life laugh for laugheveryone laugh iver umhum iver no they were from all 
over the world i had vocnoise um vocnoise one sil companion vocnoise who was from 
vocnoise russia but she was vocnoise on a temporary mission vocnoise i vocnoise uh mostly 
sil all over america but vocnoise there was a girl from mongolia vocnoise um vocnoise 
there was vocnoise girls sil there who vocnoise i never was companions with them but 
they were from russia vocnoise different vocnoise mm there was a girl from moscow vocnoise 
um vocnoise my mission president was actually from saint petersburg and his wife vocnoise they 
vocnoise they didnt speak english laugh iver you just get vocnoise sent vocnoise wherever laugh 
iver umhum iver its iver its funny because i had studied russian but a lot 
of the people i served with were vocnoise fluent in spanish or something else so 
vocnoise its like vocnoise i dont know why they got sent there but vocnoise its 
vocnoise i vocnoise i mean we cutofff vocnoise really believe that sil there sil that 
its inspired they send vocnoise our sil your name and a picture and your vocnoise 
application vocnoise to the sil prophet who is the head of the church vocnoise and 
vocnoise um vocnoise they vocnoise pray over sil it and they vocnoise decide where you 
go iver so sil its vocnoise and sometimes itll take a while to get your 
vocnoise call what unknown they sil we call your calling vocnoise or your call vocnoise 
but then you just its exciting to find out where youre gonna laughgo laughoh vocnoise 
iver umhum iver umhum vocnoise sil vocnoise iver noise iver vocnoise iver sil thats how 
i feel vocnoise thats thats what i laughbeliebelieve sil i choose to believe that laugh 
vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver noise oh sil cutoffwowould iver yeah it is iver 
no no no its not sil you can do whatever you want vocnoise there sil 
uh ive heard conferences where the cutoffpprophet sil um ive heard the prophet talk about 
how sil you should cutofft sil keep in touch with the people that you sil 
served and vocnoise or the people that you worked with and that you knew and 
vocnoise and that they sil even if they cant cutoffreremember sil you cant remember how 
to speak just try and laugh send them a cutoffleletter vocnoise sil ive been really 
laughbabad about that so i feel sil a lot of pressure to unknown i need 
to vocnoise i mean its cutoffnnot sil cutoffiit vocnoise i just dont wanna lose contact 
with them sil because you sil get these great sil friendships and sil vocnoise sil 
but yeah you can vocnoise theres sil i know people that have sil married people 
from their vocnoise i mean thats really not supposed to happen while youre on your 
mission but vocnoise when you yknow when youre done if you vocnoise wanna go back 
vocnoise um sil is that happens too sil but its really not sil looked sil 
i mean you shouldnt sil thats against sil the rules vocnoise on the mission vocnoise 
um sil if the people wanna get married sil when they get home vocnoise thats 
fine sil but sil um sil yeah thats sil its sil its another thing where 
youre focused trying focus on your work and sil youre not allowed to sil date 
sil never alone laugh so vocnoise and um sil vocnoise but vocnoise you can live 
where youve sil served you can do whatever you want sil after youre done vocnoise 
iver okay laugh iver i actually sil vocnoise joined the church vocnoise in uh well 
i dont know it was six years ago about six years ago vocnoise and they 
did a survey here at o s u sil and they were cutoffuum sil um 
just asking people vocnoise if they thought sil that christ had visited america and there 
was a record of that sil account if sil do i think that would be 
important sil and i was like sil well sil i think so yeah laugh vocnoise 
and sil but sil i didnt i was kinda hesitant sil i mean it took 
me a while to sil i sil read the book of mormon i really sil 
prayed about it and sil took me about six months sil vocnoise and sil and 
then i finally decided that i really sil cutofflliked liked it and it was sil 
what sil i had been wanting sil so vocnoise so thats how i decided iver 
umhum iver no sil i dont think it was because vocnoise i grew up sil 
just sil basic sil not even really christian just sil really vocnoise not sil no 
real religion vocnoise and id been going cutofftto to cutoffprepresbyterian presbyterian church sil as i 
was about nineteen years old sil looking for something a church vocnoise i just had 
a feeling that i wanted to sil have that in my life sil because id 
never sil had that before laugh vocnoise and so vocnoise i was just looking around 
and i was open to anything i had listened to sil eastern religions and vocnoise 
ive listened to the jehovahs witnesses and vocnoise and sil and then when i sil 
vocnoise read in sil the book of mormon its just vocnoise i sil its a 
feeling of like sil like sil i felt like sil i had heard it before 
sil vocnoise and sil it made sense to me sil and vocnoise sil and so 
thats why sil i really sil felt sil at home with this and thats sil 
why i decided iver no i never did i sil i dont know of sil 
many people that do but sil vocnoise sil but sil it was vocnoise also sil 
for me i think vocnoise if i know somethings true sil hesi sil i just 
know it sil and then vocnoise as long as it keeps on being true over 
and over again sil if its not just some exciting thing that sil for one 
day unknown oh this is great vocnoise but like sil six months later it still 
has the same vocnoise still ringing true vocnoise a year later two years later sil 
then vocnoise thats how i feel iver umhum sil i read it iver yeah sil 
i do i vocnoise and sil and if sil i read it vocnoise every extday 
sil i try to vocnoise and um sil and i vocnoise we go to sil 
church i have all sorts of activities that i do vocnoise and i just cutoffaalways 
sil always feeling like im reinforced sil that sil its not sil just some sort 
of vocnoise flaky idea that its vocnoise for me that its sil um real and 
sil vocnoise and it it just cutoffaalways always makes sense sil thats important to me 
that i feel like it sil makes sense iver noise iver umhum sil yeah iver 
yes vocnoise it does sil definitely he went on a mission to texas vocnoise and 
sil hes sil hes been back for a while hes thirty two laugh well hell 
be thirty two in april iver noise iver vocnoise probably it is youre right sil 
i vocnoise i asked him what language did he have to to learn to laughgo 
laugh vocnoise iver yeah vocnoise iver no he didnt either he joined when he was 
sixteen sil and he was catholic before sil vocnoise and sil similar just sil kind 
of thing with him just iver having meeting the missionaries and laugh iver umhum sil 
yeah we met sil um sil at vocnoise where we theres a singles sil ward 
vocnoise where we call ward vocnoise its on twelfth avenue sil down here vocnoise and 
sil its just where all the sil single sil people under thirty sil go to 
church and theres sil dances and sil different activities and iver umhum sil its at 
sil its at the same building actually its sil its unknown vocnoise its used for 
different things sil vocnoise noise iver yeah iver umhum vocnoise its kind of frustrating sil 
but sil vocnoise sil im sil i sil its a cutoffgogood its probably good for 
me because vocnoise im vocnoise so sil its hard for me to vocnoise just sit 
back and let other people vocnoise believe whatever they want laughtobelieve yknow vocnoise i just 
want to convince them but sil i cant do that sil vocnoise so its a 
good sil exercise for me i look at it that way and sil vocnoise just 
letting them sil go ahead and vocnoise iver umhum sil but theres things that are 
sil difficult like vocnoise there sil unknown the vocnoise where we go sil we sil 
we have a sil temple too sil vocnoise and they cant go in the temple 
vocnoise well they can but they have to sil fit sil fit certain sil criteria 
they have to be baptized and not sil and follow all these health codes and 
all the different codes and vocnoise but sil thats not what theyre sil vocnoise interested 
in doing laughso vocnoise and sil and thats hard i sil think sil and like 
sil going on a mission vocnoise really sil they didnt understand that theyre my dad 
was like sil do they know how small you are theyre sending you to siberia 
vocnoise sil so iver they didnt know sil iver no sil they thought it was 
sil my dad told me later that thought i was vocnoise getting sent off and 
sil just by myself yknow iver vocnoise yeah iver more like that sil right iver 
laugh yeah right vocnoise real war laugh sil iver extoh laugh vocnoise iver laugh iver 
vocnoise iver laugh iver thats all right sil laugh iver mm vocnoise iver umhum sil 
i think his mom was pretty sil yknow doesnt really talk about it wanna talk 
about it vocnoise he comes from vocnoise his vocnoise his sil real cutoffffamily sil biological 
family is very sil um sil vocnoise i dont know if guess youd call it 
dysfunctional or vocnoise theyre sil um sil he didnt live with them sil after he 
was sil fourteen or so his sil it was just sil vocnoise so bad that 
unknown his mom couldnt take care of him and his sil his siblings so vocnoise 
he was sil pretty much on his cutoffohown sil own but vocnoise he was taken 
in by a family that was members of the sil mormon church iver noise and 
vocnoise sil so sil iver vocnoise mm basically they didnt sil legally sil adopt him 
or anything but vocnoise theyre the ones that he considers his family really sil and 
vocnoise i mean he still keeps in contact with his sil mom and his dad 
sil but its always kind of a laughchallenge vocnoise iver theyre just sil her she 
was drinking sil i mean terrible alcoholic and vocnoise very his cutoffmamom his father was 
very abusive and they didnt werent even married iver that he remembers sil unknown sil 
he remembers the stepfathers and laugh vocnoise and that kind of thing vocnoise its just 
sil not good laughstuff iver no it was sil his mom ran away is what 
happened iver yeah his mom sil vocnoise couldnt take care of him anymore and he 
was like i think he was about fourteen and vocnoise he just sil unknown vocnoise 
he didnt have really anywhere to go vocnoise and luckily these families had taken sil 
his different siblings sil different families took them sil vocnoise i dont know how they 
got connected with the church because it was all church families that sil took care 
of them vocnoise but sil um sil vocnoise it was good for him because hes 
got that example iver and sil so sil iver i dont know if theres any 
particular sil vocnoise i think sil if someone knows sil if anyone knew of something 
like that going on they would sil sil in a heartbeat try and help them 
sil vocnoise sil but they dont i dont think they sil make an effort to 
like sil put out any sil yknow sil vocnoise iver laughyeah iver okay laugh iver 
umhum sil art iver vocnoise drawing and painting is my major sil and sil i 
sil i um vocnoise i like doing all sorts of different things they dont sil 
vocnoise i havent even had any painting classes yet sil so its kind of funny 
im like taking sculpture and vocnoise and sil drawing and vocnoise sil next quarter i 
have a painting class sil vocnoise sil vocnoise yeah sil right iver vocnoise umhum ive 
hesalways been into sil art sil in in high school i went to uh sil 
art sil vocnoise sil cutoffsschool sil like uh sil unknown sil excludename vocnoise sil and 
i was sil for fine arts sil and vocnoise sil i sil always sil vocnoise 
sil wanted to do art vocnoise because i cant do anything laughelelse vocnoise sil no 
its sil mostly sil im im not good at extmath or i mean i could 
probably major in english or something like that but vocnoise sil not math laugh sil 
laughyeah sil its is the talent sil my husbands good at math so thats where 
i laughgo sil im grateful for vocnoisethat iver umhum sil i did sil iver well 
i never really sil think i had sil first of all i didnt have sil 
the vocnoise motivation i dont think to put in the effort to do it but 
sil i dont think i had very good advisors when i was first here vocnoise 
i didnt really understand the idea of sil that sil u v c was separate 
from sil art college and sil that you had to sil apply and sil i 
didnt really know i just like oh okay iver noise vocnoise i just sil well 
but vocnoise i didnt understand as much as you laughprobably vocnoise i just like sil 
like sil clueless as to what i needed to do to become an art major 
vocnoise and id go to my sil advisor and theyd tell me what to take 
and it was the art sil advisor but vocnoise sil i didnt really sil think 
sil i had to do anything special like i didnt cutoffknknow know about the portfolio 
review and all that stuff vocnoise sil and that was probably my own fault for 
not vocnoise sil asking questions but sil so it took me a while and and 
i just sil kind of unknown sil went to columbus state sil and went on 
a mission then came back and sil so i just got accepted into that college 
sil vocnoise but sil laughyeah iver its the art school iver vocnoise year iver yeah 
sil its sil its a um sil probably about four years left sil im almost 
done with all my g e cs and everything like that so sil thats about 
done laugh iver umhum laugh vocnoise its all vocnoise ive learned a lot its been 
interesting sil ive liked my classes vocnoise iver well cutoffahi i have sil um sil 
ive sil a have a sil different cutoffopoptions sil options im thinking i could either 
extbe an art teacher or have some kind of vocnoise um freelance type thing to 
sil from my exthome sil and sil i sil i really sil want to just 
sil um hurry up cutoffsschool sil get done with school as fast as i can 
i vocnoise we really my husband and i really wanna have kids and so vocnoise 
we dont vocnoisewanna sil laughyeah vocnoise sil we dont wanna wait very much longer vocnoise 
the some of the classes im taking are sil hesprobably sil um sil kind of 
sil dangerous though sil like sil the sil fumes from the paints and stuff vocnoise 
so sil i cant sil have to wait till those are over sil laugh laughyeah 
vocnoise iver oh yeah iver stop yeah those are real chemicals iver yeah sil you 
still have to sil be careful and sil yeah iver so you have how many 
kids cutoffusjust iver one sil well thats good sil thats laughexciting iver oh thats great 
laugh iver oh iver yeah i cant wait laugh sil iver vocnoise well actually he 
was i dont know if youve heard about sil the excludename extacademy sil deal vocnoise 
well he was one the teachers that sil um sil tried to start a union 
sil and was sil laughfired vocnoise iver okay vocnoise iver well hes hes sil yeah 
he taught math but they had a general curriculum was just like he taught sil 
seventh grade vocnoise sil he gave him math science vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil supposedly 
social studies sil all the stuff that sil i mean it was just sil it 
was very poorly run vocnoise sil to begin with so sil we would go out 
and sil try and find books for the kids i dont know if vocnoise you 
heard that they he hadnt bought them books and vocnoise so we had to buy 
them laughand sil i mean they got reimbursed but vocnoise it was just ridiculous vocnoise 
so they were trying to sil do anything they could and sil just to keep 
their jobs and keep the school vocnoise iver humum vocnoise iver umhum vocnoise yeah its 
supposed to be an alternative sil type sil to the public schools vocnoise where they 
can vocnoise hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have 
not iver gotten somewhere extelse iver umhum sil right sil education definitely sil and its 
military sil so vocnoise iver yeah uh he cutoffhihis vocnoise he and vocnoise three other 
people sil well a lot of them had signed the union sil they have to 
have almost everybody sign sil for it vocnoise but sil um he was one of 
the people that had really vocnoise sil been vocnoise yes sil and so vocnoise sil 
he fired him but not for that because sil you cant do that its illegal 
vocnoise so he vocnoise but he sent a form letter sil with vocnoise everybody cutoffevereverybody 
it was exactly the same sil to the three people that were fired vocnoise except 
for their names were changed sil for the sil these vocnoise like basically made up 
reasons iver i mean hes uh hes kind of in big trouble they sil theyre 
vocnoise wanting to pull the charter on him and everything vocnoise so that cutoffiit vocnoise 
sil but hes gonna try and um vocnoise sil keep the school open which is 
gonna be ridiculous iver umhum excludename is his sil excludename yeah vocnoise sil but sil

vocnoise principal realized that nobody knew noisetheir times tables sil he had a big pizza

great time laugh it might be better laughnow laugh iver was a guinea pig type 
sil situation sil its probably better in high school as more college prep iver okay 
iver no thats fine iver iver once upon a time there was a gentleman named 
excludename sil and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot iver every 
time i fan myself it goes noiseupitsanice feature sil sorry ill stop go ahead laugh 
doesnt matter when i clear my throat and youre listening to it its gonna be 
annoying as hell sil yeah sil my apologies in advance iver were getting more fun 
stuff all the time but predominantly its still got way too much cowtown personality iver 
umhum iver noisewhere iver oh sil unknownupstate iver i live in albany therefore im cool 
iver i was born in new york iver and therefore im cool iver yeah noisethatshowitworks 
iver since i was five that makes it twenty years iver went to sil worthington 
high school sil and sil in sil the end of my third year it became 
worthington vocnoise kilbourne high school and thomas worthington high school iver vocnoise and so i 
got to be the first graduating class of this brand new school that they built 
because the old one had just overflowed beyond sil all noiserecognition iver vocnoise and sil 
we called it the uh the taj mahal sil because theyd spilled bunches of information 
into it sil or bunches of money iver and sil vocnoise it was pretty sil 
vocnoise it was fun to be the first class in the school cause everything is 
brand new iver vocnoise iver umhum iver cause theyre so stylish iver laugh iver what 
they should do is just tell people that their kids dont get to go to 
school sil vocnoise i bet the attitude changes pretty fast laugh iver extyeah iver but 
its such a good idea did i go to ohio state yes vocnoise sil yes 
sil i told you that earlier though but yeah it wasnt being recorded then so 
its okay iver laugh sil laughitwas um vocnoise well it started out as sil uh 
computer science under the college of arts and sciences vocnoise but then there was this 
whole foreign language requirement and a bad incident with a counselor and eventually i became 
a vocnoise a unknownel proud member of the college of business iver laugh iver i 
had foreign iver i had french in the sixth grade vocnoise and i got as 
sil i had sil um sil german and spanish in the seventh grade vocnoise and 
then the sil uh sil eighth grade vocnoise sil i had french vocnoise and then 
ninth grade sil i got sil um sil vocnoise sil in the ninth grade i 
had french vocnoise in the tenth grade i had french sil and sil my junior 
year of high school sil i had french vocnoise and my cutoffrereportcard grades went sil 
extbs sil straight bs sil noisecs sil straight cs sil ds sil straight ds and 
i said vocnoise i think i should get laughoutnowandi noisestopped taking it i didnt take 
french my senior year vocnoise but then the arts and sciences came around and said 
you will have a foreign language requirement vocnoise and i like well i already know 
all this french i might as well take cutoffssome more french vocnoise and a first 
year freshman sil year of french sil unknownyah it was not fun vocnoise my second 
year sophomore i started in for another year of french and vocnoise about three quarters 
unknownofthe way through the year i realized that sil every day was all about dreading 
french class before and after vocnoise i would spend extall up to french class going 
no no french class then all after french class going god that was so cutoffmisermierable 
vocnoise sil i was like sil this is stupid sil this is no way to 
live my life vocnoise so i went to my counselor i said sil no french 
class sil thats how its going be see you need to figure out how im 
not going end up taking cutofffrenfrench we have to take a french class you have 
unknownto i was like vocnoise no sil dont have to take a french class iver 
noiseshe said well vocnoise you have to take a foreign language you have to i 
said look im not taking any more foreign languages were gonna figure out how to 
avoid this or vocnoise no you have to take a cutoffforforeign i said look lady 
there are sixty thousand students in this university vocnoise and if you think that vocnoise 
im going to believe for a second that they all take foreign language classes after 
having seen the college of foreign language vocnoise youre insane vocnoise theres another way to 
do this experience sil what is it vocnoise cutoffwewell you have to take a foreign 
language i said sil okay sil were gonna change the question a little bit here 
you have two options now sil tell me how to avoid taking foreign language sil 
or tell me how to talk to somebody who isnt you cause thats apparently all 
ive got available vocnoise said vocnoise well you exthave to take i said how do 
i talk to somebody else vocnoise she said well you have to talk to me 
sil as long as youre in this college sil i was like vocnoise wheres the 
extform iver so i became a proud sil business major iver extno no it doesnt 
vocnoise iver unknownyeah iver laugh iver mmhmm iver there are some um sil foreign activities 
classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding noiseclasses iver yes iver theres vocnoise 
an unknown theres a feeble attempt to make you well rounded sil is what there 
is but theres no sil specific sil language extclass iver vocnoise iver extyeah its curious 
isnt it iver yeah and as i got older unknown noisei noisecontinued to lose interest 
noisetoo iver i dont have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you i 
just sil noticed that sil vocnoise sil it continued to decline all through high school 
and i was like yeah you should get out before you actually fail the class 
laugh noise and um sil vocnoise sil it was sil it was just unpleasant vocnoise 
i think i was stupid vocnoise i think thats what it amounts to noise not 
that i was not able to pick up the data sil i was just sil 
um sil thats uh unwise vocnoise in in whether or not it was worth while 
noise and i believe that its uh sil horribly worth sil while now vocnoise and 
yet now im not taking classes sil so iver noisein iver at the end of 
march i go extto sil europe vocnoise i travel around for a minimum hundred days 
with a backpack on my back iver and outside of english sil french is a 
unknown horribly popular language sil for sil different countries to have as a second language 
vocnoise so i think unknownitd be sil extraordinarily useful to me now if i had 
a greater understanding of french iver extyeah iver cutoffrereality reality strikes laugh iver sil um 
sil wander around look at things iver talk to people sil yes sil iver sil 
minimum hundred days iver umhum iver vocnoise iver extah sil i had three months sil 
and then it got postponed then it got postponed again and i was like this 
is stupid vocnoise in exchange for postponing it again sil my rationale was fine ill 
give myself another ten cutoffdadays noise iver vocnoise because it was also a nice sil 
like sil unknown a hundred is such a pretty round number iver um sil vocnoise 
ive a great employer vocnoise and i vocnoise i got hired in vocnoise sil one 
of the opening lines in the sil interview conversation is hi i am excludename sil 
and vocnoise sil in this particular month im going to europe but i may or 
may not come back sil you wanna continue talking sil he said sure lets keep 
talking sil i said okay vocnoise sil and then we continued talking so vocnoise sil 
um sil its up in the air iver i told him that he gets no 
guarantee that i will come back vocnoise sil and sil in exchange sil i dont 
get health coverage sil while im gone sil laughthat laughseemed laughperfectly laughreasonable to me and 
i unknown okay super vocnoise iver um vocnoise my sister had gone a couple times 
sil extand sil vocnoise basically took me aside sil and i have vocnoise but one 
sibling vocnoise and um vocnoise its sil its fun to have a sibling because nobody 
is sil more similar to you than that sibling because they had to deal with 
the vocnoise inanity that is your family iver for a long period of time iver 
extyeah vocnoise hesthere iver vocnoise iver but i imagine your sibling has a a similar 
world view sil perhaps sil noisetwisted in some sil unknownsome sil iver oh sil my 
my sisters sil cutoffparticularparticularly religious and that that sil tends to warp her view of 
everything iver in a fashion that sil makes it vocnoise almost diametrically opposed to mine 
a great many times vocnoise but at the same time vocnoise extthe sil the unknown 
pre religion understanding of something thing iver is extraordinarily similar vocnoise um vocnoise sil so 
what she says might not sil might be diametric opposed to what i say iver 
but how she got there she started out somewhere iver is vocnoise sil often so 
similar to where im coming from iver that once you unknown filter it through something 
it looks different sil but previous to that sil yeah theres a lot there vocnoise 
theres sil errorchjust vocnoise way too much shared experience to sil to gloss over effectively 
vocnoise so when she said sil look if you never listen to sil anything else 
that i say sil you will listen to this sil you need to go to 
europe sil i sil was like sil okay sil ill go to europe iver oh 
yeah iver later sil next vocnoise sil afterward vocnoise sil mmhmm iver vocnoise iver mmhmm 
iver vocnoise london paris prague budapest amsterdam venice vienna berlin munich sil uh theres sil 
probably some more on there but thats all of the ones that jump off vocnoise 
theres like a a sil a little hit list in my head obviously and sil 
another hit list in sil my palm pilot sil vocnoise sil life is good iver 
vocnoise sil vocnoise can i just say yes sil vocnoise laugh i like lots of 
stuff vocnoise um sil vocnoise i like games iver predominantly vocnoise i like vocnoise i 
like playing sil vocnoise um vocnoise sil i like puzzles sil vocnoise i like challenges 
sil i dont like jigsaw puzzles vocnoise um sil vocnoise i like sil anything that 
involves sil fixing it sil vocnoise i dont mind breaking things either sil because then 
you have something to fix afterwards vocnoise made me a very bad latchkey child vocnoise 
iver i am sil uh i dont actually think that i i sil i could 
call myself an engineer amongst engineers but vocnoise uh i think if i was calling 
myself an engineer to a psychologist it would be okay sil laugh iver mmhmm iver 
mmhmm iver yeah hesit says sil iver double e major iver unknown yeah iver sil 
ill just keep them as friends sil laugh that works sil iver um sil iver 
i dont think it ever really occurred to me iver honestly i dont think it 
ever really occurred to me iver sil unknownritheyre unknowntheyre hesjust like sil hmm vocnoise sil 
everybody else is taking double es vocnoise sil but im having fun over here doing 
this sil computer science thing and happy joy sil yeah sil iver maybe i should 
go back get a degree in sil electrical engineering that would be a lot of 
fun iver vocnoise even if they dont pay me itd still be fun iver so 
am i sil laugh vocnoise um sil i missed your question before that iver sil 
i play with computers sil um vocnoise normally when people ask me i tell them 
what i did that day sil or what i did the day before if they 
ask me in the evening or vocnoise so um sil what did i do today 
sil vocnoise what i do today vocnoise noise internet information server is a product by 
microsoft vocnoise it lets you sil house web pages vocnoise and put them out on 
the web sil index serve is another product that lets you sil put search engines 
on that vocnoise um vocnoise then theres another product by a company called splitcycle its 
called netstock it sucks vocnoise netstock basically goes out to yahoo and checks to see 
sil what the stock prices on something are sil and sil so sil i made 
netstock sil iis and index server sil all play nicely together today sil iver vocnoise 
both sil um vocnoise today i was farmed out to bank one vocnoise sil i 
sil yesterday sil was monday i was farmed out to bank one sil friday sil 
vocnoise sil farmed out to bank one but now ive resolved all those three issues 
vocnoise sil and they dont have anything else to throw at me interesting vocnoise so 
im leaving sil tomorrow ill be back at the home office sil working on some 
other stuff that sil vocnoise sil will benefit us in franchising because franchising is vocnoise 
sil a much better way to make sil money than selling time for unknown sil 
for money sil selling time for money sil for money sucks sil iver mmhmm iver 
selling time for money sil yes iver iver oh yeah iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver 
yes sil muchos money sil vocnoise iver familiar with sarcom yes sil laugh iver vocnoise 
yeah but its not a good way for me to make money sil vocnoise extbecause 
sil if youre farming out sil people sil or if youre better still sil drop 
it down a level vocnoise if you are exchanging sil hours sil for money sil 
or sil time sil for money vocnoise then you have a finite amount of time 
sil and that sucks sil iver should have some other thing to exchange for money 
sil vocnoise i would much rather exchange ideas for money vocnoise or previously done work 
for money vocnoise or something obnoxious and stupid like a franchise for money vocnoise im 
in favor of that vocnoise i come up with a good system by which to 
do things sil i sell it to you vocnoise you go do those things vocnoise 
i sit around and make money off of your efforts sil yeah that sil so 
vocnoise iver sil sure sil vocnoise sil laugh um vocnoise going into business for myself 
sil i need something to sell vocnoise sil and selling my own time doesnt actually 
seem to be a worthwhile endeavor vocnoise ive done it sil ive already vocnoise done 
independent consulting sil extah wherein sil i set up a contract and said vocnoise hi 
sil you pay me ill do this thing sil and i go do that thing 
and you make a lot of money like that vocnoise problem is you get taxed 
obscenely like that because you dont have an employer paying half your taxes for you 
sil vocnoise sil and um sil theres sil other bunches of overhead involved vocnoise and 
sil theres sil the constant cycle of marketing oneself vocnoise sil and it all depends 
on how much you wanna market yourself sil vocnoise marketing yourself is sil easier for 
some people than for others sil vocnoise sil and its sil more fun for some 
people than for others vocnoise sil extso vocnoise so far i dont know if i 
iver vocnoise iver its a lot easier to market yourself iver beggars i love it 
noise iver extmm iver mmhmm iver laugh iver vocnoise unknownokay iver sil vocnoise sil end 
of march i dont have a plane ticket yet i have a eurail pass though 
sil iver yes iver vocnoise yes sil iver hi im approachable sil laugh iver do 
do do iver vocnoise bruge in belgium vocnoise b r u g e vocnoise sil 
iver bruge in belgium sil vocnoise so i have a game going on with a 
good friend of mine named michelle vocnoise i have this stupid ring here you see 
the ring vocnoise sil so um sil i have lost noise something like two incarnations 
of this ring just flat out lost them vocnoise because well ah im an irresponsible 
cuss vocnoise sil and um sil vocnoise one of them sil a third if you 
will vocnoise i gave to her sil iver or more accurately i think she took 
it sil but sil its a fine line sil extum sil vocnoise sil and so 
she wears that around sil and sil exti sil replaced it sil so i had 
my own again i wear this one around so we have a competition to see 
who can get the most well traveled ring vocnoise you get two points for every 
country sil and you get one point for every state or province within that country 
iver vocnoise uh sil it counts if youre touching the ground sil or if something 
that youre sitting on is touching iver exti know vocnoise well sil you cutoffgget you 
get to take advantage of it vocnoise for layovers and stuff its iver its pretty 
cool iver mmhmm iver sil i i dont hate all vocnoise iver mmhmm iver noise 
extah iver noise sil okay sil vocnoise well im not adopting that rule sil and 
vocnoise sil fortunately the judge of our game isnt listening to our conversation so i 
feel kind of safe sil laugh vocnoise a mutual friend uh much better friend of 
mine than of hers vocnoise but shes more attractive than i am so we figured 
it all balanced out sil laugh we decided that made him unbiased sil iver mmhmm 
laugh iver vocnoise she has already been to europe twice sadly sil and has accumulated 
sil all of forty four thirty four points sil iver yeah sil vocnoise sil and 
sil iver two for country sil one per state or province iver sil no sil 
iver no sil iver once youre in it youre been in it and thats it 
vocnoise i have thirty two points sil iver noise belgium sil what do you think 
sil western europe sil netherlands holland sil vocnoise sil excludename doesnt know his geography for 
shit laugh for the record iver laughyeah laugh iver ive already learned an immense amount 
looking at my eurail thing sil okay so belgium is extuh vocnoise iver okay iver 
sil okay sil belgium is its own country iver i dont know where im going 
to fly into honestly im noisethinking noiseof errorihof doing a courier flight sil iver sil 
mmhmm sil vocnoise iver mmhmm vocnoise iver town with the chunnel iver take the ferry 
from errorsoutheasttsoutheast london sil iver prague sil vocnoise czech sil republic sil extum sil budapest 
iver thats the optimism yeah sil vocnoise sil okay i have now dover sil and 
ferry sil what else do i need to remember iver sil okay now i have 
sil bruge sil ferry to sil im sorry vocnoise dover ferry to bruge belgium vocnoise 
sil and then train iver at that point i errorgiget to activate sil my eurail 
pass iver vocnoise i teach a class on thursday nights noise sil extum sil how 
to play with computers sil vocnoise sil exti um sil play games on tuesday nights 
sil iver extgames sil i dont know extwe we vary it from one week to 
the next iver um vocnoise sil noiseeither sil role playing games iver under whatever system 
noiseis popular that sil day vocnoise sil extum sil extor card games sil iver sil 
vocnoise not usually fifty two card deck cards but sil other interesting types of cards 
iver or board games sil or sil vocnoise just sil vocnoise anything that happens to 
appeal sil iver is a iver group of five guys who know each other sil 
iver sil iver sil extmm sil no sil some of them play at game stores 
noisebut i sil done it once and said eh sil it wasnt that good vocnoise 
iver and continue merrily on with sil my day sil vocnoise iver sil vocnoise there 
you go iver i had enough sil friends who said to me vocnoise can you 
make money with computers sil noiseand i said sil yes you can make erroroneymoney with 
computers sil and i said vocnoise sil what sil could i oneymoney with computers sil 
iver then i finally just said vocnoise sil okay sil laugh training people to make 
sil money with computers vocnoise so sil iver none of these noisepeople vocnoise would sil 
well sil no sil some of these people would know what ebay is but probably 
only one or two out of like six sil iver sil so vocnoise sil what 
were talking an extraordinarily low level understanding of what computers are how they work so 
vocnoise class one was demystifying the computer sil we took it apart vocnoise we labeled 
everything inside i gave them all a piece i said put it back together vocnoise 
sil we turned it on we saw if it sil worked sil we went back 
in figured out why it didnt work sil took it apart again vocnoise this wasnt 
something can do hardware because hardware vocnoise sil has sil no money in it sil 
but vocnoise sil um it was so that theyre not scared of the magic box 
iver and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer 
scared of the magic box and could continue to operating systems extword extum sil the 
goal of learning operating systems is real simple sil vocnoise if youre playing with computer 
sil vocnoise sil and you screw something up sil vocnoise sil the worst thing you 
can possibly do sil is screw it up so badly that you have to start 
over sil iver starting over means sil putting a new operating system on it iver 
sil sil anything else sil is a hardware failure and you have to go sil 
fix it sil somewhere else anyway vocnoise so sil if you know how to put 
an operating system on your machine sil you can start over vocnoise sil if you 
can start over theres no reason to be scared of anything that you do sil 
problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that theyre 
going to break something sil iver so once you convince people that theres nothing errorneto 
be scared of here and theres nothing to be scared of there vocnoise i mean 
and then they start to play vocnoise noise and once you start playing you start 
learning sil iver if you cant play sil you wont learn you just sit there 
and follow my directions and thats dumb sil iver vocnoise most of them are still 
sadly just sitting there and following my directions but theyre getting better iver sil vocnoise 
iver vocnoise extum sil vocnoise sil weekends i usually try and keep sil free sil 
so that i can sil make stuff up sil extum sil and uh sil i 
dont vocnoiseknow sil because of the usually the the one night a week that isnt 
sil horribly well scheduled vocnoise wednesday nights are preparing for travel sil iver and you 
told me not to this that sil errorsso sil trying errortto stick to that sorry 
vocnoise sil extum sil iver friday nights are date night sil iver because i become 
unpopular if i have sil like sil noise any time away from my girlfriend sil 
iver vocnoise the more time i have away errorframfrom sil no sil iver sil no 
sil vocnoise sil uh this is sherry sil iver sil so vocnoise extuh i spend 
time away from sharon i become unpopular sil iver sil and if i continue to 
do that for a long sil for long period time i become very unpopular sil 
iver sil so to that end we have vocnoise a designated friday evening date night 
noise vocnoise sil sherry usually tries to get sil all of saturday and all of 
sunday as date night as well sil sort of like an extended date weekend thing 
iver this is a game we play every weekend vocnoise sil its sil its exta 
sil okay game sil vocnoise sil extum sil monday night sil i usually sil come 
up with something dumb that needs to occur sil iver sil this vocnoise was something 
that i would have done sil on a monday night sil iver sil iver for 
whatever reason laugh yeah vocnoise yeah vocnoise iver extuh girlfriend works for hell sil also

to him than anybody else i ever got to play with vocnoise sil extum sil

it sil chris you keep playing vocnoise ill be right back vocnoise downstairs out the 
front door see my sister on unknownthe couch go over to the car vocnoise get 
the stuff out of the noisecar vocnoise sil and extum vocnoise sil look up and 
there two police noiseofficers coming towards me sil iver like ooh sil police officers iver 
ooh scary vocnoise okay vocnoise and cutoffiit vocnoise it was funny because vocnoise you see 
the cops first vocnoise but in reality the cops are behind noisetwo other people i 
actually know sil vocnoise but it doesnt matter noise because you always see cops first 
vocnoise so sil the two other people that i actually know are extmy extstepmother vocnoise 
laughstepmothers vocnoise sil extum parents sil vocnoise stepmother and father have been split up for 
i dont know a month or two now vocnoise sil theyve been married for something 
like six months now vocnoise sil and um sil my sister and i both wanted 
to tell her ahead of time that shes making a horrible mistake but vocnoise she 
wouldnt have listened to us so we didnt bother telling her iver vocnoise sil um 
vocnoise so sil vocnoise theyre coming up and vocnoise sil uh there has been like 
divorce papers and stuff ah unknown and i knew that sil police officers are occasionally 
used to deliver important documents vocnoise i dont personally think that divorce documents are that 
important vocnoise but vocnoise nothings beyond the realm of possibility for people take things way 
out sil vocnoise way too seriously vocnoise yes iver yes vocnoise but vocnoise theres nobody 
at home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious 
affair so i just figured vocnoise something weirds going on i didnt know what was 
going on but at the same time vocnoise it was all divorce related vocnoise just 
sil basically dumb vocnoise because sil the divorce wasnt going to faze me because sil 
the entire marriage was sil vocnoise we knew heswe knew from the beginning it was 
a dumb idea vocnoise and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable vocnoise so were 
just kind of waiting around going oh theyre gonna be divorced in a couple months 
vocnoise and sure enough so anyway vocnoise um vocnoise extso vocnoise sil i sil i 
look at these people and their names are the excludename sil and so the excludename 
are coming forward with two police officers behind them vocnoise and mister excludename is kind 
of a large gentleman and hes way too somber noisefor noisethis experience and vocnoise if 
you have to like be that somber about something as stupid as a divorce im 
going to give you some sort of shit for it vocnoise and vocnoise at the 
noisesame noisetime noise vocnoise um mrs excludename vocnoise used to be a principal of mine 
elementary school vocnoise iver uh my stepmothers iver mother vocnoise used to be a principal 
of mine in elementary school vocnoise so vocnoise sil uh hes like excludename hesi think

was like errorhooh boy youre way too serious for this particular affair vocnoise okay thats 
errorsinefine vocnoise we knew ahead of time this also coming to an end dont worry 
about it vocnoise sil so i exti sil extum sil at this point in the 
story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for vocnoise i 
dont know where that is sil i never found it never saw it never it 
its vocnoise anyway sil not relevant at all the story but vocnoise it bugs me 
every time i tell the story because vocnoise doesnt exist vocnoise anyway vocnoise so sil 
we come back inside and hes like well ive got some bad news and my 
sisters like sil why vocnoise erroraeand like all sil okay go ahead vocnoise sil vocnoise 
sil and hes like sil no i cutoffthithink i think you should sit down im 
like vocnoise sil all right vocnoise iver all right vocnoise sil iver at at this 
point hesi hesi stopped for moment im just like vocnoise sil extso vocnoise sil nobody 
can think vocnoise sil their divorce was so important that i need to sit down 
to deal with it because hesi hesi obviously vocnoise i hesi i have the curiosity 
that something whack is hesuh sil is uh sil is afoot vocnoise noiseand sil vocnoise 
errortsoso i vocnoise okay sil vocnoise sil i sit down sil vocnoise sil say vocnoise 
your your father killed himself this morning vocnoise sil and i said sil oh vocnoise 
and then theres like hesa sort of a whited out sil period there so vocnoise 
you dont get like sil vocnoise decent details on on what occurred i noisedont noiseactually 
think anything exciting occurred vocnoise i think mostly its me and sil my sister on 
my lap vocnoise sil and me smelling my sisters sil wet sil stinky hair vocnoise 
sil because it smelled of cigarette smoke for some reason vocnoise so sil wet stinky 
hair vocnoise wet because i was crying into it vocnoise sil extand extum sil and 
then more time passes so some cutoffinindeterminate indeterminate length of time vocnoise later vocnoise sil 
um sil i i look over at the police officer whos sil standing on one 
side and the cops are there basically to make sure i dont freak out vocnoise 
and thats finally sunk in i was like vocnoise the cops are here so you 
dont freak sil and like vocnoise sil oh im not really in any danger of 
freaking out sil am i sil then youre laugh and unknown was like vocnoise what 
would freaking out look like vocnoise you would never know vocnoise thats why the cops 
are here oh laughokay laughcool laughthat laughmakes laughmore laughsense laughthen vocnoise i was like okay 
so sil i looked theres a cop i said sil i have a friend sil 
upstairs and i wasnt able to put on anything more than that sil and it 
noisedidnt come out noiseanywhere near that well iver but vocnoise managed get that much information 
out vocnoise so the other cop goes upstairs and sil vocnoise chris sil chriss interpretation 
of the story at this point is vocnoise one moment im cheerfully playing on the 
computer and the next moment vocnoise sil i noise i turn around theres a large 
police laughofficer laughihin laughdoorway of your room vocnoise he said vocnoise sil hi sil laugh 
he said i think you should come downstairs vocnoise they dont tell chris anything vocnoise 
sil so chris comes downstairs and he noisestands beside me sil iver vocnoise and the 
cops on unknowntheother side of chris sil and vocnoise sil and now chris is just 
sil noise near me trying to be sil near me has no idea what noise 
the hell is going on vocnoise sil and laugh hesi i this sil this sinks 
into vocnoise sil and sil i was like vocnoise sil noiseyou sil you sil dont 
sil vocnoise did they tell cutoffyyou cutoffyyou any sil cutoffddo you unknown vocnoise sil he 
said sil i have no idea whats going on vocnoise sil oh sil vocnoise and 
i couldnt noisedo anything about vocnoise i couldnt tell him i couldnt communicate i was 
vocnoise totally laughincapable laugh vocnoise yeah unknownand iver well the sil vocnoise it was just 
sil vocnoise communication wasnt there iver yeah well there wasnt even an opportunity for me 
to try and think of ways to say it it just noise there was nothing 
there there was no ability to communicate there was a vocnoise he needs to know 
this piece of information at the same noisetime theres no way i could tell it 
to him so vocnoise yeah vocnoise laugh is like vocnoise sil so sil so im 
vocnoise sil yeah you dont know and theres noise nothing else to do about it 
and continue on merrily and hes i he said eventually he said it was some 
time later when i actually found out laughwhat laughwas going on i said i had 
some suspicions vocnoise because you can do a quick party count and figure out whos 
not there and assume something bad has happened but vocnoise sil um but sil he 
said sil but it noise was a while before i found out actually sil so 
sil so we can stop sil we can stop the story here or we can 
go on because this story vocnoise it sil its a fun story but iver okay 
extso um sil vocnoise chris and i vocnoise sil extuh spent vocnoise sil the rest 
of the evening sil calling people vocnoise sil uh sil i got it in my 
head that i didnt want anybody to call and to say hows your dad doing 
vocnoise and so the best way to deal with that situation was to call sil 
extglobally vocnoise cross the board vocnoise plus it was a fun psychological experiment just vocnoise 
as sil as they go vocnoise sil cause vocnoise how often do you get to 
tell laughpeople laugh your dad just killed himself this sil morning vocnoise so vocnoise exti 
vocnoise sil exti sil exthi how you doing sil unknown vocnoise no i havent talked 
to you in a little while is everything going okay vocnoise sil actually no my 
sil my father killed himself this sil morning vocnoise sil youre kidding sil vocnoise so 
sil you you end up vocnoise after a dozen or so people vocnoise sil noise 
narrowing it down vocnoise youve got youre kidding sil vocnoise youre not serious sil extno 
iver extreally vocnoise oh my god vocnoise sil and then you can hash mark them 
if you want we didnt but you could vocnoise sil laugh vocnoise and sil we 
had two people who who vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise said vocnoise youre kidding sil 
vocnoise and then said vocnoise sil never mind im sorry pretend i never even said 
that sil i was like sil wow sil somebody mustve done this before laugh because 
everybody is just like vocnoise sil theres no other response vocnoise but iver errorthitheres so 
theres theres no faulting i mean these folks but sil still theres nothing else do 
and theres nothing creative in response to say to this experience so vocnoise sil you 
end up with youre kidding again and again and again vocnoise sil and you had 
two individuals who said youre kidding and then immediately following it cutoffyayoure unknownlike sil never 
mind pretend i never noisethat that laugh vocnoise iver oh yeah iver sil vocnoise iver 
yeah he was he was giving me phone numbers for sil at least sil two 
or three hours vocnoise we had sil uh several phone books vocnoise and vocnoise sil 
um vocnoise like sil a sil vocnoise church calling list and some other sil errornauseousobnoxious 
stuff we had just bunches of numbers vocnoise and so he just fed me names 
and numbers vocnoise and i noisewent noisethrough noisethem vocnoise its not ten after vocnoise okay 
sil and um vocnoise sil so lets see at the end of that sil um 
noise there was a lot of supporting sil uh sil erin vocnoise sil and then 
there was some calling of like family people vocnoise younger vocnoise sil and um vocnoise 
sil noise sil noise so there was supporting of erin and then there was calling 
of girlfriend vocnoise but you cant do the calling of girlfriend until youve arranged for 
ride because girlfriend lives two and a half hours away vocnoise sil and so if 
you call the girlfriend and tell the girlfriend that vocnoise sil that your father just 
killed himself vocnoise she freaks out because she unknownhhhas no way to get there vocnoise 
sil so noise you have to arrange for ride first sil vocnoise ended up having 
a guy who lives in logan drive up to bowling green vocnoise sil to get 
her sil and then drive back down vocnoise sil extto sil uh bring her back 
vocnoise sil and he said is there anything i can do i im gonna come 
up there sil i said sure sil drive sil by vocnoise laughi laughsaid continue on 
to vocnoise hes like okay sil fine sil no problem vocnoise sil i said vocnoise 
then i sil then i could call vocnoiseevan and say vocnoise sil he will be 
there extin three hours sil unknowntherell be a nice silver r x seven at noisethis 
location get in laugh vocnoise sil and so sil she spent the next sil two 
and a half hours canceling classes and stuff iver vocnoise oh sil he vocnoise hes 
polite ill give him that much vocnoise sil noiseokay well vocnoise iver vocnoise sil i 
defended my stepmother sil uh sil against the rest of my family immediately following my 
fathers death because there was ah some bitterness between the rest of my family and 
my stepmother vocnoise sil so my sister and i defended my stepmother against the rest 
of my family vocnoise stepmother eventually shafted us vocnoise sil and sil so stepmother is 
evil iver theyre fun iver just saying stepmother makes sil me go unknownih vocnoise sil 
iver hope your father doesnt drink iver oh well thats unfortunate laugh iver okay sil 
noise sil iver my name is excludename vocnoise sil iver okay iver what department iver 
noise oh just noise was going down like iver sil oh i tightened this good 
noise its like its falling i oh it there it can go sil noise noise 
cool sil perfect vocnoise iver okay iver okay sil uh my name is excludename sil 
exti extuh am an undergrad double major in german and history currently working on a 
senior honors thesis vocnoise in history vocnoise i will be graduating next quarter vocnoise after 
a grand total of six years as an undergrad vocnoise an impressive uh somewhat vocnoise 
disturbing six years as an undergrad sil ah i live in german village vocnoise sil 
uh sil i like it here sil grew up here sil like it here sil 
uh vocnoise i think of it as a big city sil vocnoise sil having been 
to other big cities it sil feels more like that then small towns which sil 
ive also sil been to of course but iver my thesis is on the sudeten 
germans those are the germans who lived in czechoslovakia vocnoise sil uh sil before the 
vocnoise second world war sil and uh specifically im looking at how they perceived their 
condition vocnoise switching from being part of the austrohungarian empire vocnoise sil uh and the 
germans being sort of the sil vocnoise sil uh sil the majority sil uh even 
though they werent the majority but sort of the the uh the vocnoise sil the 
master nation within the austrohungarian empire to becoming uh sil cutoffmitminority a minority within czechoslovakia 
iver ah ive always had an interest in vocnoise german history vocnoise and also in 
eastern european history vocnoise and vocnoise i mean it seemed to be a natural way 
that i could tie those two together for a thesis sil iver german sil yeah 
iver all right well laugh as most people dont like to hear vocnoise uh relatives 
and stuff im taking a year off iver and then ah sil errorabtendingattending grad school 
iver uh i vocnoise plan at this point to sil pursue history to the sil 
p h d level sil vocnoise sil ah sil anything of course can happen iver 
but sil thats my plan iver uh relax sil uh get a a dead end 
job that doesnt come home with me vocnoise uh sil try and pay off my 
debt sil and maybe make a little bit sil vocnoise so sil i i i 
uh vocnoise sil grad school yeah vocnoise vocnoise but vocnoise also enjoy all the things 
i didnt get to do iver uh sil while sil working on this thesis this 
is cutoffbebeen project that has been ongoing for about a year vocnoise and ive vocnoise 
voluntarily given up a lot of things i like to do and im looking forward 
to catching up sil uh vocnoise music vocnoise uh sil painting vocnoise vocnoise sil uh 
sil that sort of thing iver yeah just having fun iver yes i have several 
times sil iver vocnoise iver um vocnoise well one of the things im doing is 
im applying for a number of research grants to go to germany continue my research 
so hopefully ill get one of those vocnoise um sil i sil think im in 
pretty good vocnoise shape to get one of those so vocnoise sil uh thats vocnoise 
sil that might sil cause me to put off grad school for a year but 
sil i dont think the grad schools will mind if i sil iver if they 
have cutoffsosomeone someone who gets a grant whos already sil planning to go to their 
school so laugh iver yeah so iver yeah sil iver not too much sil uh 
i was planning on vocnoise sil vocnoise i hadnt always planned on taking a year 
off but getting into the research uh sil cutoffhahas like one of the things i 
sacrificed was looking into grad schools and applying to grad school this past vocnoise sil 
year so vocnoise yeah so sil uh sil i mean i id like to go 
here its one of my errors choices cause i like the faculty and i like 
the program but sil uh uh sil i plan to spend the next couple months 
well sil the first few months after i graduate looking at other schools sil iver 
oh yeah vocnoise sil iver yeah iver vocnoise take care of that soon vocnoise iver 
okay iver cool vocnoise iver ah iver right laugh iver vocnoise um i would like 
to teach sil um sil mm the sil the field is sil particularly saturated right 
now so im not vocnoise holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean id 
like to think that i could distinguish myself within the field and get a job 
but vocnoise i mean right now those jobs simply are not available vocnoise so sil 
uh im sil approaching things like whatever happens happens im gonna pursue my interests and 
then sil vocnoise sil go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about sil career 
plans after i finish my schooling sil iver laugh oh yeah vocnoise iver umhum iver 
um vocnoise i got into painting somewhat recently vocnoise sil uh ive always done a 
lot of art sil uh sil my mom is an elementary school art teacher so 
i was always exposed to sil art sil as child sil uh did pretty good 
sil too vocnoise i never got into painting it was mainly drawing that kind of 
thing vocnoise sil and just uh vocnoise sil yeah three or four years ago i 
thought im gonna learn how to paint sil and i learned how to paint sil 
iver and vocnoise sil i like painting iver so iver vocnoise sil um vocnoise laugh 
sil vocnoise sil most of my paintings uh uh cutoffthithis this is gonna sound funny 
most of my paintings sil are of sil uh sil images from star wars iver 
now vocnoise this sil most of my paintings were completed sil uh before vocnoise uh 
like nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six before sil vocnoise sil it came back out 
it was more of a thing sil like images from my childhood coming back out 
sil and now its suddenly sil uh vocnoise you hear about it more often so 
vocnoise thats why im a little funny but sil used to be impressed like i 
paint star wars iver unknownlike i paint sesame street or something i dont paint cutoffsessesame 
sesame street just something from childhood vocnoise that i paint and now its vocnoise somewhat 
mainstream so it sounds a little funny i also ive sil painted sil vocnoise sil 
a cutoffcoucouple couple of portraits noise pretty happy with of some friends i sil have 
done a self portrait vocnoise sil um sil that kind of thing sil iver okay 
iver umhum iver vocnoise iver um vocnoise sil vocnoise cutoffyeyes kind of sil uh i 
mean it was something i was really into sil uh vocnoise sil until sil i 
dont know maybe about fourth or fifth grade at which sil vocnoise sil point things 
sort of switched to sil yknow like i dont know like sil vocnoise killer robots 
or something like transformers that kind of thing vocnoise sil uh in high school sil 
i uh vocnoise sil i dont know i think i cleaned my room or something 
or cleaned my closet and found my old toys im like star wars is fun 
im gonna watch star wars more often i had them on tape so i sil 
started watching them and got vocnoise sil i dont wanna say into it because i 
know people who are sil really into it vocnoise im pretty into it but its 
not the same kind of thing i dont think but sil back when i started 
doing the vocnoise sil the painting uh vocnoise i i graduated from high school in 
ninety four just to put things in a little perspective sil uh vocnoise so something 
like my first couple years of college vocnoise sil uh from hesm sort of the 
second half of vocnoise high school to my first couple years of college i was 
just sort of sil vocnoise sil just sil i dont know i liked the story 
sil um sil i liked looking at the stories from a sil different perspective as 
a kid as a kid i was i was always like sil iver oh boy 
like sil action sil oh sil fight the bad guys yeah vocnoise sil and now 
its sil uh sil yknow like sil looking sil vocnoise sil sort of postulating deeper 
vocnoise meaning to sil vocnoise what the characters have to go through using sil elements 
of the story as a metaphor vocnoise for sil things in real life vocnoise sil 
uh sil and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect 
on me as a as a child and hesupon our culture i think its kinda 
interesting and now that its coming back sil out sil uh sil i mean i 
sil look at things from a little different perspective but vocnoise i mean yeah sil 
sil of the sil maybe vocnoise sil i think ive done about ten twelve paintings 
of which im sil like vocnoise consider to be done and sil and like vocnoise 
iver uh id say sil eight of them laugharestar wars related kinda thing vocnoise so 
the recent ones have been the laughportraits actually but sil i like star wars iver 
vocnoise sil i didnt like it vocnoise sil but sil i liked elements of it 
sil and sil its vocnoise sil unlike the the first star wars movie vocnoise this 
one really is meant to be part of a trilogy vocnoise the first star wars 
movie when it came out sil i mean it was sil uh uh in cutoffssome 
many ways an experiment it was sil vocnoise part of a of a larger story 
iver vocnoise because the larger story was too large to film in one cutoffffilm vocnoise 
one movie vocnoise but vocnoise sil this one as a as a sil as a 
part of a whole sil i im sil reserving complete judgment until sil iver vocnoise 
until see what else happens i mean from what i know vocnoise sil this story 
was kinda happy and it was it unknown sil many ways a childrens story vocnoise 
but what has to happen within the larger story between now and sil and sil 
yknow the end of sil episode three sil is vocnoise sil like sil the republic 
falls sil and the empire takes over and all the jedi are killed by this 
cute little eight year old kid iver yeah iver right iver umhum iver yeah vocnoise 
id always maintained that uh vocnoise sil back in the day uh sil the darth 
vader was the tragic hero of the star wars thing it wasnt sil yknow about 
vocnoise like sil the innocence of luke skywalker vocnoise and vocnoise unknown rebellion and iver 
sil casting off authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a 
bad choice vocnoise sil uh sil yknow gaining power because of it sil and then 
ultimately seeing the the folly of the ways and dying sil in the classic vocnoise 
sil um sil tragic hero sort of vocnoise way sil um vocnoise and so im 
looking forward to how they build up to that point vocnoise um lot of people 
when i was in high school theyre what the hell are you talking about bo 
vocnoise but uh sil vocnoise sil um sil yeah im looking forward to seeing how 
things vocnoise sil come about vocnoise iver ah i like star trek vocnoise sil um 
sil iver vocnoise not so much old star trek sil uh i like deep space 
nine of the new ones sil um sil i mean unknown vocnoise back when it 
was new i liked the next generation but sil vocnoise sil once deep space nine 
came out and it had a grittier sil darker story that sil wasnt so vocnoise 
cookie cutter in fashion there was cutoffkikind uh sil vocnoise a greater degree of continuity 
from episode to episode sil and sil more character development sil vocnoise it wasnt like 
these perfect sil people on this ship going and facing bad errorpeopeople the the characters 
themselves had flaws vocnoise sil and that caused for better drama so i like that 
dont like sil voyager so much i vocnoise cutoffssee vocnoise i see that it sil 
when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it sil as 
something that would be even grittier vocnoise sil cutoffeveeven sil they had the the potential 
for for sil excellent sil intercharacter conflict vocnoise sil but they glossed over all those 
immediately vocnoise sil within the first season sil um vocnoise sil and sil that sil 
really bothered me and then vocnoise it sil ultimately the storys like sil theyre trapped 
vocnoise but they dont sil really pursue like the sil issues of being separated from 
home in sil two factions that had iver very big differences sil stuck together on 
a small ship vocnoise they just sil glossed over those and it became just like 
the next generation except for they didnt sil talk to the federation as much anymore 
so i didnt like that one so much but sil vocnoise iver yeah sil iver 
sil yeah sil iver her her little boyfriend who was the sil the captain kirk 
vocnoise commander riker cutoffperperson like sil vocnoise stud persona vocnoise i see in many ways 
sil vocnoise sil i vocnoise sil i mean i agree in deep space ah um 
sil big deep space nine fan its like i dont dislike voyager i just dont 
like it to the same degree vocnoise sil um sil in deep space nine they 
had major kira who was a soldier sil and a revolutionary vocnoise and sil hesih 
i thought in many ways she sil like sil completely broke out of traditional gender 
roles i sil also like deep space nine in that vocnoise sil uh vocnoise sil 
vocnoise sil they address the issue of different people living and working cutofftogethtogether different people 
of different vocnoise sil i mean these were sil aliens rather than different cutoffethethnic vocnoise 
sil ethnic denominations of humans but it it sil approached that from a less vocnoise 
sil um vocnoise sil vocnoise sil from uh a more realistic standpoint in instead of 
having it yknow like an old star trek yknow everyone gets along then we sil 
come to people who dont get along and we look at the problems vocnoise it 
was vocnoise centered on that vocnoise sil uh noise sil i im getting off topic 
i wanted to go back to to vocnoise voyager what you were saying about the 
vocnoise sil the sil the uh sil generals i sil i liked cutoffhhaving vocnoise sil 
at first having vocnoise sil uh sil captain janeway being a female in the leadership 
standpoint but i cutoffffeel sil vocnoise sil i still think that sil uh sil the 
cutoffffemale vocnoise the women on the show particularly vocnoise seven of nine vocnoise sil um 
sil there are used as sex objects vocnoise sil uh for the for the viewers 
iver yknow she doesnt have to be wearing that tight outfit i think thats for 
ratings vocnoise i really do think its for ratings vocnoise sil um iver she wears 
high heels why would she wear high laughheels laugh iver laugh iver iver its vocnoise 
story elements iver her forceful personality too sil iver is iver laugh iver yeah i 
mean i dont see any particular reason for her to wear the spandex vocnoise cutoffiexcept 
except for to appeal to a sil uh eighteen through twenty five male audience which 
vocnoise sil i think it does laugh iver sil lets watch seven of nine sil 
iver vocnoise with the the children yeah vocnoise iver vocnoise sil yeah sil my favorite 
character sil unknown sil on that show sil had always been chacote sil and i 
dont like how vocnoise i dont like how his character has been portrayed in cutoffrrecent 
sil in the errorrecisrecent couple of seasons sil um vocnoise sil i liked the fact 
that he was someone who had been a star fleet officer vocnoise sil but sil 
because of a matter of principle sil uh left star fleet joined the makee but 
was still sil uh fundamentally an honorable person vocnoise sil um sil and sil had 
to deal with being welcomed back into the fold of star fleet sil by being 
sil uh first officer on the ship but still had to balance vocnoise his his 
new life vocnoise sil uh i saw so much sil potential for sil uh sil 
interesting stuff with that sil but i feel that sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil hes 
sil become just the sil just another character to unknown deliver lines for most of 
the episodes that ive seen from the sil this sil this past season i stopped 
watching it for a while sil period and then since sil deep space nine left 
i needed a little star trek fix every once and a while vocnoise so i 
started watching it i also dont have cable so ah its on vocnoise u p 
n and fifty three doesnt come in terribly well so vocnoise um i mean sometimes 
its like i dont want sil kind of see whats going on but iver vocnoise 
um i liked it theres an episode i think it was in the third season 
where they were stuck on an island sil or vocnoise island vocnoise iver its an 
island but a planet together i liked it sil there i kinda like and i 
figure vocnoise theyll probably hook up but vocnoise i dont like how the show vocnoise 
sil this show and this happened with deep space nine two and sil even with 
sil next generation for a little bit vocnoise how the shows become sil soap opera 
like vocnoise um i mean the romantic aspects of the stories dont extreally appeal to 
me very much vocnoise um im more interested in the social things and yknow good 
old special effects vocnoise um vocnoise sil but vocnoise i i think i like sil 
that how its kept with a sort of sil i sil tension and its not 
sil like sil unknownyknowimean theyre not sil completely thrown together like sil uh vocnoise belanna 
and tom sil which sil i dont like that at all iver and its just 
sort of like uh whenever it comes on i roll my eyes vocnoise that episode 
where they were stuck out in space and vocnoise extuh just vocnoise if the tape 
can catch me rolling my eyes its oh vocnoise iver every week sil i record 
them laughtoo laugh i vocnoise yeah vocnoise like xfiles laugh iver i love that iver 
no i dont want them to get together i love the tension if they get 
together its dead vocnoise whenever they get sil uh sil unknown any of there are 
like five or six examples where it looks like there gonna hook up i mean 
that one where theres like a vocnoise a cutofff vocnoise a the duplicate mulder iver 
unknown well that guy who can change form vocnoise that vocnoise in the movie theyre 
about to kiss and hesi i dont like it when they get that close vocnoise 
i sil i like the vocnoise how their cutoffperprofessional their relationship is still professional sil 
vocnoise and they interact with each other on that level first and theyre very good 
friends vocnoise sil and they have that tension but they dont sil succumb to it 
and vocnoise i really like it i just dislike it a little less iver or 
cutoffdisdislike um vocnoise sil like it a little less or dislike it a little more 
when sil when it sil it looks like its gonna come to cutoffclippingsomeusomething it looks 
like theyre sil it feels like theyre trying to tease me vocnoise as an audience 
and uh uh i vocnoise sil thats not something i feel peased by vocnoise sil 
noise particularly iver vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise which one are you cutofftalktalking iver vocnoise 
yeah vocnoise iver it felt innocent to me sil and i liked that sil vocnoise 
sil um because all the other times where they started to kiss sil its always 
been like vocnoise sil stereotypical romantic da da da da da vocnoise and thats like 
sil wow two friends alone sil its new years sil vocnoise perfect sil yknow it 
wasnt it wasnt like they were gonna jump in the sack or anything like that 
iver it was just sil vocnoise so i didnt object to that one at all 
iver umhum iver um vocnoise i feel that the past season sil the past two 
seasons really havent been as strong as the earlier seasons vocnoise and so sil in 
some ways im sil yknow hesi i unknown vocnoise im not as upset about sil 
the xfiles vocnoise sil completing its run as i have been about other shows i 
mean its also the simpsons sil final season ive heard iver ah sil ive heard 
it it hasnt been as sil cutoffiive ive heard it from sil less reputable sources 
iver so iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise yeah hesi vocnoise i love that show ive nearly 
every episode on tape but this past sil this past season ive sil ive been 
really disappointed sil with the simpsons iver yeah iver cutoffwidwith iver yeah iver been highly 
sil critical of of organized religion iver yeah sil iver yeah vocnoise iver yeah vocnoise 
i mean i i think that the stories havent been sil ah i i mean 
im sil some of my favorite sil like lines from the simpsons is where there 
highly critical unknown one of my favorites is uh when bart noise sil the one 
with where sil bart thinks he loses his soul sil which in some ways is 
kinda preachy sil um vocnoise cause i mean vocnoise like sil lisa takes vocnoise other 
positions like ya whether the soul is is real it doesnt matter da da da 
da da vocnoise but i love it one scene while theyre sil cleaning out the 
vocnoise uh vocnoise well noise bart and hesmilhouse are being punished theyre cleaning out the 
pipes sil of the organs vocnoise sil and sil the the pipes of the organ 
and uh vocnoise like sil barts like theres no such thing as a soul milhouse 
is like why would they lie to us what would they have to gain and 
then they unknown it cuts to uh sil errorrevelreverend sil reverend lovejoy vocnoise emptying vocnoise 
the uh sil uh sil uh what are they uh the sil the vocnoise tip 
jars the unknown the donation thing into a little change counting machine vocnoise like sil 
vocnoise sil i dont hear cleaning laugh what would they have to gain laugh vocnoise 
um iver oh yeah vocnoise yeah its like what religion are you laugh oh that 
one it has all those unknown those great rules noisethatdont work out in real life 
vocnoise christianity vocnoise laughyeah laugh iver laughyeah laugh iver yeah laugh youre happy and you 
know it clap your hands iver laughchristians laugh iver yeah i iver i like that 
aspect i mean i dont know i dont pay attention to who the writers are 
vocnoise um so maybe the writing sil has changed iver south pacific yeah iver yeah 
laugh iver gambling vocnoise iver laugh iver yeah i mean sil i want to see 
how the season ends out its just sil a lot of the ones this season 
to me have just been disappointing the vocnoise unknown vocnoise i mean i think every 
show sort of has a peak some shows sil peak towards the end some at 
the beginning and sort of sil level off i mean the the simpsons had a 
stretch vocnoise from like their third year sil through like their seventh where things were 
just sil like sil unbelievably funny and sil then they had some writing changes i 
think and this sil this season is just vocnoise sil its unknown been vocnoise completely 
outrageous story lines vocnoise sil and sil like sil the jokes arent as integrated into 
the story iver i mean therell be unknown there seems to me there more one 
liners vocnoise so im a little disappointed im sad that the shows going off sil 
the cutoffththe the shows gonna stop but im not as vocnoise sad because the product 
im getting now it sil with the simpsons vocnoise having it being replaced by futurama 
which sil ah i find to be sil absolute genius vocnoise unknown so its not 
so bad it sil xfiles vocnoise im sad but not as sad based on the 
past couple seasons when deep space nine went off the sil the air that one 
really bothered me vocnoise and vocnoise they even had a star trek replacement iver still 
on but uh vocnoise i dont know iver um iver kinda yknow we know but 
its iver vocnoise cutoffththe sil what ive sil liked so much about it is they 
tell you everything and then sil you find out that its not right vocnoise and 
that its wrong i mean sil there was the episode sil uh the two parter 
sil uh last season where it was sil the advertises full disclosure iver and iver 
what sil and the first episode the first half was sil excellent had the cigarette 
smoking man just sil it was from his perspective vocnoise he was talking that then 
the second half got like iver oh no vocnoise and it turns out it was 
the vocnoise sil the uh the faceless aliens set a trap for the vocnoise for 
the guys and sil i didnt like the way it was resolved but i like 
the fact that it wasnt sil resolved the way that they set it up vocnoise 
so i think that sil i mean cutoffwwe sil we supposedly know about samantha vocnoise 
iver but vocnoise cutofff sil shes out there somewhere vocnoise yknow we dont sil have 
sil again we dont have clear evidence vocnoise where she is and there were couple 
times where they sil where we thought we knew where samantha was vocnoise sil uh 
vocnoise and when there were all those clones of her vocnoise sil uh i think 
that was in the second season or so vocnoise um sil vocnoise sil i think 
if cutoffththe vocnoise if they were gonna end it they were gonna have to have 
like three episodes in a row that just were tieing up all these loose ends 
that they keep having vocnoise i suspect they probably wont do that vocnoise sil theyll 
sil um vocnoise leave things open ended for sil future tv movies or maybe another 
sil uh vocnoise feature length movie sil uh iver yeah vocnoise and theyre also talking 
about sil cause sil uh sil vocnoise uh sil the actors sil the the reason 
theyre sil ending it sil is because the actors dont wanna do it there was 
talk i dont know if there still pursuing this sil that vocnoise theyd have new 
sil characters sil take over the roles and sil i mean vocnoise sil the character 
development is the most important part i think vocnoise sil um sil so i think 
thatll be a failure but that also sil sorta sil tells me that theyre gonna 
leave things kinda open vocnoise iver right iver vocnoise cutoffiit iver they they couldve taken 
sil extother vocnoise i mean well they killed all these people off but cutoffi they 
sil couldve sil youll put them into the background sil you have them do a 
couple of shows a season vocnoise and then had vocnoise yknow i dont know the 
adventures of sil uh vocnoise oh cutoffsspender sil agent spender and cutoffwwhat sil the hell 
whats vocnoise whats her name vocnoise but then they they killed off sil vocnoise sil 
all those like sil supporting sil former xfiles associated people iver so they they couldnt 
go in that direction theyd have to just bring in new people which uh vocnoise 
i think it sil probably wouldnt be a good idea vocnoise iver laughyeah laugh iver 
yeah vocnoise and iver i vocnoise i used to kinda worry about the effect that 
tv had on me sil um vocnoise i when i was little i used to 
watch a lot of tv sil id come home from school and plop myself in 
front of the tv vocnoise sil and watch vocnoise sil i like yknow four cartoons 
back to back or so everyday after school or i sil that kind of thing 
and then saturday mornings it would be uh a block of sil yknow from six 
in the morning until afternoon vocnoise or something these days i dont watch sil nearly 
that much tv vocnoise sil um sil i dont buy these sil arguments that people 
make that say that sil like sil children sil are vocnoise like vocnoise like violence 
in tv is affecting children i mean unknown i ive seen some cutoffeevidence evidence of 
sil of sil exercises where in schools the sil kids will watch uh sil like 
a a violent cartoon like sil i dont know like sil roadrunner or something vocnoise 
sil and then vocnoise sil be a little sil rougher vocnoise but i cutoffddont sil 
i dont extthink sil that it sil it goes into like values i dont associate 
like vocnoise rising crime sil or something with vocnoise sil uh sil like crime on 
tv or something i vocnoise i mean it sil vocnoise if there is a correlation 
sil i mean i vocnoise im more of the sil yknow like vocnoise unknown sil 
parents have a greater influence on the sil children then tv ever could vocnoise i 
mean i errorlaugh watched a lot tv but sil i feel that my parents taught 
me was right and wrong and sil i watched a lot of sil rather violent 
tv violent movies all that kinda thing and uh vocnoise um iver cutoffyyeah vocnoise iver 
i have become visually desensitized to vocnoise like sil the violence that i see in 
movies and on tv vocnoise sil but vocnoise i still see a distinct difference between 
that sil and sil real violence sil um sil i mean sil in studying history 
im exposed to a number of sil like sil rather vocnoise gruesome events in history 
sil that still extare sil extvery sil i still find disturbing vocnoise sil um sil 
unknown also vocnoise hang out in low life bars and every once in a while 
therell be a fight and it it still it sil i mean it sil cutoffiit 
hesit sil it still is vocnoise disturbing to me i im sil i have a 
distinct difference in my head between sil reality and fiction vocnoise and sil vocnoise maybe 
kids sil like arent making that distinction but hesi sil hesi i dont think so 
and i think if if sil someone isnt making that distinction sil its vocniose i 
dont know that sil that theyre not cutoffr sil well vocnoise i cutoffddont i dont 
know i dont have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that 
i have it sil i feel that i have a distinct sil uh cutoffdistinction uh 
uh very clear distinction between what is sil uh sil fact and what is fiction 
what is sil true and what is imaginary sil and uh vocnoise so vocnoise for 
me i dont think that television has affected me sil in that way vocnoise sil 
um vocnoise i mean one way that cutoffteletelevision unknown sil television has affected me sil 
is vocnoise i am full of media references when i speak yknow when im hanging 
out with friends someone sil mentions a sil a subject im like hey sil simpsons 
made fun of that sil yknow at some point sil ah vocnoise uh sil thats 
the effect that it sees on me i dont think thats too big an effect 
people always used to sil yknow like sil quote sil shakespeare or something i guess 
thats sil ten times more sil elevated so like oh unknown references that shakespeare line 
or something but sil i mean it unknown sil vocnoise its a part of our 
culture and im a part of sil it iver but sil vocnoise i dont see 
it as negatively effecting me i still get all the stuff done i need to 
get done vocnoise iver vocnoise iver um vocnoise well i found that vocnoise that sil 
i mean cutoffeevery everyone sil has unknown cutoffsstereotypes sil people from outside the united states 
have stereotypes about the united states and when they actually get to know someone vocnoise 
sil those stereotypes dissipate vocnoise sil um sil i mean sil vocnoise sil i actually 
had a conversation very similar to sil this vocnoise the other night sil with a 
cutoffggerman sil couple of germans that i met sil at a coffee house vocnoise sil 
um sil i mean the sil the stereotype that most sil americans have of germans 
are those of bavarians vocnoise uh and not real bavarians but stereotypical bavarians uh vocnoise 
beer drinking bratwurst eating vocnoise sauerkraut eating vocnoise lederhosen wearing sil uh sil yknow iver 
blond haired blue eyed sil overweight people iver vocnoise iver unknown laugh iver yeah iver 
yeah well hesi sil i asked these germans what the cutoffsterestereotypes what stereotypes they vocnoise 
like are sil prevalent in germany vocnoise uh of americans and they said sil yknow 
americans are cowboys sil and eat at mcdonalds sil three meals a day sil vocnoise 
sil and sil now its our turn to deal with the issues vocnoise we see 
our parents we see this generation that all these things that are still popular its 
that we dont look down on the sixties i mean i sil cutoffththink think the 
sixties sounded like a pretty fun time to live vocnoise sil i would get into 
politics in a second vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise sil but sil those things are 
popularized but no we cant do it anymore because we got all these problems iver 
um vocnoise sil aids being one of them vocnoise iver um sil uh vocnoise politics 
sil i mean vocnoise we vocnoise we grew up sil or came of age sil 
after the cold war was over vocnoise um sil im sil very cynical about this 
i have a unknown cutoffffairly fairly leftist sil uh political cutoffsstance sil uh vocnoise cutoffsstance 
vocnoise uh stance vocnoise iver which i feel vocnoise has been sil cutoffcompletecompletely completely devoiced 
in america because of the effects of the cold war vocnoise uh sil vocnoise ive 
inherited this world where there was sil of uh sil uh where am i going 
with this laugh vocnoise um sil i mean the generation before us had sil like 
vietnam vocnoise and protested against it unknown i mean they were in many ways protesting 
against the generation before sil but vocnoise and when it came down to it vocnoise 
sil i mean the vocnoise what was the protest really about sil yknow and vocnoise 
im not being clear so im not exactly sure where im going with this i 
very cynical of sil uh about vocnoise about the world ive inherited vocnoise uh cause 
i see a world in which sil my political views sil have been silenced by 
sil fifty years of sil of sil you know like international politics sil unknown sort 
of like sil propaganda vocnoise um sil that says yknow like vocnoise to be left 
of a certain point is bad unknown like among conservative circles the word liberal is 
is like sil vocnoise sil laugh vocnoise almost like calling someone a communist in sil 
in the forties vocnoise um vocnoise where as unknown sil im very cynical about that 
cause it sil they feel that vocnoise it it wasnt sil it it its been 
a cultural process that has been developed vocnoise and now im being handed sil this 
current situation which i sil cutoffssee see is completely unfair vocnoise i mean i think 
the reason sil that our generation is cutoffcyncynical cutoffcycynical cynical and the reason im cynical 
sil vocnoise sil is vocnoise because sil were handed a world sil in which sil 
we see vocnoise sil the injustices of the past or sil not the cutoffiinjustices the 
the hypocrisy vocnoise i mean i guess injustice unknown sil also applies in sil terms 
of things like sil the cold war and stuff but sil vocnoise thats why im 
cynical vocnoise i hope that answers your question at least a little bit sil i 
dont know sil i feel kinda preachy laugh like this is my position vocnoise iver 
vocnoise iver vocnoise uh sil the technology vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil i mean sil 
like vocnoise i vocnoise like living cutoffiin sil in a world where technology puts everything 
i need at my fingertips vocnoise um sil i mean sil uh vocnoise i think 
that something that would not have happened had there not been sil a uh vocnoise 
uh sil a highly sil a sil highly populous generation suddenly that vocnoise was competing 
and sil within itself iver mean i vocnoise some ways i think vocnoise competition is 
a bad thing because in our society its usually not fair vocnoise someone always starts 
out ahead and is able to get ahead further but sil vocnoise i mean vocnoise 
i like the fact that weve got this super high tech tape recorder not a 
big reel to reel thing i like the fact that i could do a lot 
of my research for my thesis on a sil a computer internet vocnoise rather than 
vocnoise like sil going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that 
are cutoffhhere sil that are not in our library and then vocnoise where do i 
go from there vocnoise sil um vocnoise i like being able to look oh vocnoise 
library of congress has it sil ill just drive out to washington sil or have 
them send it here sil yknow vocnoise um vocnoise that i think is a major 
contribution of the past generation vocnoise uh vocnoise iver civil rights vocnoise vocnoise um sil 
well i i take the sil extreme position sil that civil rights sil are an 
illusion vocnoise um sil yeah theyre on paper sil which is a good thing because 
it was a terrible thing sil when sil uh there were laws that sil vocnoise 
sil restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender vocnoise but 
i think in many ways vocnoise it has had vocnoise little exteffect sil on creating 
an equal and fair society sil um vocnoise unknown some my leftist positions will come 
out right now vocnoise um vocnoise people have the freedom vocnoise but vocnoise i believe 
that based upon where sil where in the social stratum where you were born sil 
in the united states vocnoise uh you have a sil a limited ability to move 
sil upward sil and that the these vocnoiseclaclasses i mean i vocnoise unknown i dont 
want to say class lines because that has so many sil like sil historical connotations 
cause its sil not the sil exact same as say class was in the marxs 
sense vocnoise but sil class lines still today very much vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil 
follow race lines sil vocnoise sil and sil what good is sil like sil knowing 
that you have the freedom to vote sil when you know painfully well sil that 
sil you are not going to be able to get a job thats gonna sil 
buy a house vocnoise for your family and let them live in a relative comfort 
sil i mean vocnoise cutoffiin in real terms in things i think are vocnoise valuable 
to the individual iver uh civil rights vocnoise cutoffhahas sil cutoffwwent sil only went so 
far vocnoise sil they havent sil corrected the wrongs of the past they havent sil 
uh created uh a a sil vocnoise sil a sense in our vocnoise society that 
anyone can achieve like the american dream in in my opinion is an absolute lie 
vocnoise sil iver and that the sil the unknown the people who vocnoise whom most 
face that lie vocnoise are vocnoise sil the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation vocnoise 
um vocnoise so what sil i mean civil rights was an unknown cutoffaan an important 
step but once that step was made it was stopped sil and now i believe 
today there are sil uh vocnoise i mean it sil i vocnoise see a a 
growing movement of people who want to vocnoise who sil curtail the advances that were 
made sil in the sixties sil and its not our generation whos curtailing it its 
still sil the uh sil like sil our sil parents generation vocnoise um noise iver 
right iver right iver vocnoise yeah iver mm iver noise iver ah vocnoise iver it 
iver yeah yeah iver we have definitely made some progress in that direction sil i 
still think that there is considerable cutoffprogreshprogression sil progression that needs to be made vocnoise 
um sil vocnoise i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago whos 
a fellow history major vocnoise her vocnoise and actually her brothers a cutofffellahfellow vocnoise fellow 
history major too and a friend of mine i dont know him all that well 
which sil hesapparently her family sil i mean shes sil vocnoise shes double major in 
history and chemistry vocnoise she plans to go to med school sil vocnoise sil her 
parents sil her family supports her in this but theyve made it painfully clear sil 
that sil when sil vocnoise it sil she shouldnt plan on having a career because 
cutoffiit shes gonna hafta raise children at some point which is vocnoise sil uh vocnoise 
sil thats not the way things should work in my vocnoise sil belief uh and 
and sil the fact that its like the males telling the daughter sil like sil 
this is sil how things need to be i think sil i mean sil yknow 
i think an hesindividual sil individual should have the choice vocnoise sil but i feel 
i mean cutoffiim im concerned about a sil a uh sil like this push to 
the right vocnoise thats sort of going on hoping its sort of dieing out sil 
vocnoise sil but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four 
ninety five but uh vocnoise vocnoise sil i think uh uh sil weve reached a 
point sil where sil because not all of the sil advances sil vocnoise sil have 
vocnoise been one hundred percent successful vocnoise sil the the opposition is sil criticizing the 
advance vocnoise iver sil um sil and sil and trying to stop it sil um 
vocnoise uh im trying to think of some sil good examples sil i mean noise 
vocnoise when politicians start talking about like biological functions iver well i live on the 
south west side and work in dublin vocnoise i dont get to campus very much 
vocnoise i get to campus but its usually up to the o s u stadium 
of the o s u stadium sil uh studios iver yeah i work on the 
auction sil up there vocnoise so i sorta avoid the cutoffcacampus vocnoise main campus vocnoise 
its been a long time since i been around here laugh iver uh fawcett center 
so its sil its not even really on campus sil yeah iver uh vocnoise uh 
okay wait you know where the schott sil is iver yeah its over sil cutoffthethere 
its on olentangy down there vocnoise north of there iver okay sil noise iver vocnoise 
yeah they did it is warm in here vocnoise iver and now sil now its 
vocnoise now you iver uh huh iver thats fine noise iver hesumimum sil well my 
titles senior consulting data base specialist vocnoise work for company called excludename vocnoise its in 
dublin vocnoise um sil i work in vocnoise its hard to say what i do 
i consult on a lot of projects vocnoise iver we do cutoffah we develop a 
lot of software and vocnoise projects and vocnoise i consult on the data base side 
vocnoise iver no we run an online system where people sil cutoffususe vocnoise connect to 
our system and build a data bases sil or or access the data bases vocnoise 
hesum vocnoise its cutoffdadata vocnoise cutoffdin vocnoise cutoffda uh vocnoise cutoffeveverything everything o s u 
has vocnoise in their library collection sil is in our system sil their records came 
from us sil uhhuh vocnoise yeah cutoffththe well they yeah vocnoise and we do that 
for hesuh sil tens of thousands of libraries vocnoise yeah iver uh essentially all the 
big academics most the cutoffuus sil uh cutoffiit its actually vocnoise all over the world 
its international iver the cutofflilibraries iver yeah probably cause we have some public systems sil 
most of them are for the librarians but theres some for public too iver vocnoise 
yeah vocnoise iver right sil yeah we dont have a web browser version thats what 
were working on now thats what ive been working on iver yeah vocnoise iver well 
iver cutoffthathere there is a web access to some of our systems when thats all 
cutoffla were cutoffma putting a more uniform one up for everything vocnoise and i dont 
it may be vocnoise they vocnoise o s u has some system but they can 
also connect to our system sil for things they dont have in their system and 
its sil so im not sure what sil system youre talking vocnoise iver yeah and 
vocnoise i dont know what o s us is set up like sil yeah sil 
they might connect to us they might not iver its a lot of the its 
looks a extlook and feel is a lot a lot the same iver yeah sil 
yes iver and your display might be different but its its basic information and i 
and vocnoise we developed the system that people started doing that on is sharing the 
data vocnoise um sil actually it started here on o s u campus and now 
were independent iver yeah iver no i worked at the library when i was a 
student vocnoise iver vocnoise actually i vocnoise thats what got me interested and so i 
went to library school and iver yeah iver uh case western sil cleveland sil youre 
not from around here are you laugh iver well iver vocnoise oh okay vocnoise noise 
iver noise vocnoise a lot of exciting stuff going on now at the libraries its 
not vocnoise not the old hesyknow vocnoise old lady in the bun vocnoise noise sil 
yeah vocnoise yeah sil and the web has really changed that iver vocnoise no i 
work for the company but i consult on a lot of projects vocnoise within the 
company sil um vocnoise yeah were doing pretty well its about a hundred fifty million 
dollar business iver vocnoise oh thirty sil forty thousand its international sil yeah iver yeah 
i dont vocnoise well we just sort of started making a big splash in sil 
australia in about the last three years sil so uh they they may now they 
may have iver yeah vocnoise yeah they they cutoffaall all of them theres vocnoise actually 
other systems too and they all have pretty much the same look vocnoise but as 
you said theres little details that are different and vocnoise iver oh yeah sil ive 
been doing it ive been there twenty over twenty years so sil yeah im enjoying 
it vocnoise its always changing iver oh vocnoise the technology is changing i mean the 
web is really revolutionized what were doing sil uh vocnoise well its sil anybody can 
connect to the web iver uh before we used to have a noisesystem that only 
people in the back sil room of the libraries connected extto and it was vocnoise 
all mainframe and then people got p cs vocnoise on their desk and suddenly the 
whole world of vocnoise who could access vocnoise any system and what they could do 
on their desk vocnoise changed vocnoise uh and now weve gone more out in the 
public work in the public scene do its not just for the people in the 
back room vocnoise uh vocnoise and then the web yknow people anybody anywhere can connect 
we only worked with libraries before now were trying to figure out vocnoise how do 
we deal with anybody who just can wants to connect to us vocnoise iver most 
of them that are our site now we have more of a distributed system where 
we can actually go out and connect to others vocnoise people vocnoise connect to us 
and then go out as a gateway to other places sil yeah vocnoise were vocnoise 
getting more into that now vocnoise but that wasnt easy sil so easy before either 
the sil yknow the web again iver then that has changed it iver no we 
sil we havent sil uh vocnoise yknow theres always that laugh uh but we havent 
noise iver yeah it can be a problem uh if you get hit iver know 
like if our system would shut down it would cost us vocnoise i dont remember 
what it is yknow tens of thousands of dollars for every hour sil that were 
down vocnoise hesuh sil if our data base would be trashed sil our main noisedata 
base would be trashed wed have real serious problems and it could take weeks vocnoise 
or sil months to rebuild it sil uh yeah so it could be a problem 
vocnoise uh weve got people working in that area iver wait a minute i dont 
know what you mean iver oh iver uh sil well vocnoise yeah well librarians traditionally 
have problems with sil and its like a form of censorship vocnoise yknow big brother 
things noiselibrarians have vocnoise always had problems with that vocnoise uh vocnoise i sil i 
dont know its sil its hard to balance it vocnoise if somebodys out there actually 
doing criminal work vocnoise criminal activity vocnoise and causing damage you want to know about 
it but how do you vocnoise do that and still protect the rights of everybody 
else its vocnoise i dont know how to balance it vocnoise noise iver what do 
you mean iver cutoffriright right right and that sil yeah vocnoise and again if its 
criminal activity vocnoise you want cutoffsomeonsomeone you want somebody to stop it and know about 
it but if its sil cutoffiim vocnoise im not doing anything i want anybody to 
know about vocnoise yeah and then whats to prevent them from going and finding out 
what some companies doing what research is vocnoise and thats the part thats a threat 
on the web too is that vocnoise you can connect in somebodys system and they 
dont know that youre there and you can see what theyre doing if noisetheyre doing 
research vocnoise uh yknow developing a new product or something you can sil yeah sil 
its vocnoise corporate espionage vocnoise and im sure thats going on and ive heard cases 
of it vocnoise yeah vocnoise well sil and the thing is people are real sharp 
and no matter what you do theyll find a way cutoffaroaround sil yknow vocnoise its 
vocnoise nobodys found a way to prevent people from noisegetting in vocnoise and people are 
real good about finding new ways to do it iver vocnoise iver ah yeah vocnoise 
iver yeah hesi yeah i guess so there i mean there people who spend seem 
to errorpsendspend hours doing computers doing this type of thing vocnoise just going out there 
and seeing what they can find iver i know i hesdo i do not want 
to go i dont want to touch a computer when i go home iver uh

up through the board and sil just vocnoise its not as focused sil ya know 
i dont know how to describe its like sil the teachers are cutoffsahsort sort of 
cutoffhaehave it seemed like they almost had the feeling theyre on their own sil where 
its more cohesive within the catholic schools like that vocnoise seems to be very clear 
theyre all going in the same direction and working as a team sil i dont 
know if you ever listened to any of the uh sil columbus board of education 
meetings are on the radio iver uh pretty interesting vocnoise everybody talks and frequently nobodys 
listening laughits its noiseand yeah its its pretty interesting um vocnoise talking about how they 
dont have the money for this and they dont have the money for that and 
then somebody comes up with sil well lets spend the money over on something else 
and nobody acts on it then they go on to something else iver vocnoise iver 
oh yeah iver well uh its like the unknown iver well you cutoffhahow how long 
have you been here iver uh okay vocnoise well there noise few years ago there 
was this big fuss so ya know noiseweve got to close some schools unknown sil 
ya know noiseenrollments dropping its sil ya know noise its the way noise population goes 
vocnoise enrollments dropping we cant afford to keep them all going so lets close and 
they did this big study and they sil targeted some to close vocnoise well there 
was a big uproar from the people sil whos kids went to that school sil 
like there will be whenever you close a school so the board backed down and 
changed its mind sil the next year they came out with a study saying they 
need more schools sil but there wasnt the money for it so there was a 
big fuss about that then sil two years later they came out with another study 
vocnoise it says well they need to refurbish or not vocnoise some schools close a 
couple then knock some down and rebuild em sil and its like every two years 
its a different direction and its like theyre almost afraid to take a stand that 
somebodys not gonna like sil well if youre gonna shut a school down somebodys gonna 
be really ticked off iver vocnoise right iver i my cutoffsunknown my kids went to 
a school that vocnoise well my son had already left it but in sil the 
fourth grade they announced sil took all the kids in the auditorium and said sil 
were closing next year sil and it was hard but sil yeah once its reached 
the point thats decision is made and announced and sil i mean there noisewere good 
reasons for it sil um sil and they explained the reasons and sil ya know 
sil at some point vocnoise you have to figure out how much do you wanna 
fight something sil when its inevitable iver vocnoise well thats the problem i think sil 
school board theyre always stopping something and they dont seem to move forward very well 
sil vocnoise iver sil i dont sil vocnoise sil i dont know if thats what 
percolates it vocnoise its very different in the public schools the catholic school the public 
school sil you have all the problems of society school you have the drugs you 
have the absentee extparents you have the delinquency sil in the catholic school they just 
sil you dont have that for one thing vocnoise sil uh ya know its oriented 
around the church even though were not catholic sil vocnoise its still oriented as so 
theres lot of values sil that permeates everything well they dont do that in the 
public school because if you do that somebodys gonna get ticked off its the wrong 
value and vocnoise noise why are you doing this to my kid noise vocnoise sil 
um vocnoise so i think thats missing sil vocnoise thats a problem within the school 
sil the public schools vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise sil so just seems to be 
more distraction from the educational process know mean when youre in the catholic school and 
youre in classroom sil they deal with the discipline sil if they need to sil 
sil course part the hesproblem way they deal with it is they take the real 
problems and send them hesoh back to the laughpublic laughschools vocnoise uh but in the 
public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think 
hesthat sil hesit sil unknown its harder for the teachers to teach sil vocnoise sil 
cause theres too much stuff in the way of unknown they hesneed sil really theyre 
there to do iver i dont know i hadnt thought about that sil uh vocnoise 
sil vocnoise sil hesi i dont sil vocnoise sil no i dont sil i dont 
get the impression the values as anything sil vocnoise to do with what theyre doing 
in the school iver well i get the sense that if there are discipline problems 
its so hard to get anything done sil vocnoise sil solve them unless you unless 
somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school ya know thats sil vocnoise 
the big thing now but just that ya know sil vocnoise sil its just so 
hard to get anything extdone vocnoise um sil vocnoise sil and i think at that 
point the teachers get frustrated because they dont see the support sil vocnoise sil throughout 
through the administration and if they do have unknown sil unknown sil they have to 
wait til somethings pretty sil vocnoise sil pretty egregious before they sil before its dealt 
with sil iver yeah sil noise iver vocnoise sil theyre hesunknown errorerrorpreventedpreventive from doing much 
sil vocnoise sil yeah sil yeah i yeah i just dont think that they sil 
can do much vocnoise and i unknown im sure its very frustrating for them sil 
vocnoise sil well and i know it is unknown we got friend whos vocnoise sil 
was a teacher she just retired a couple years ago shes about our age vocnoise 
sil and uh sil its its very different now sil uh sil you know its 
she said its scary going into the classroom sometimes sil vocnoise sil uh and before 
it wasnt that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a 
hesunknown vocnoise know go and get something dealt with it sil noise vocnoise sil now 
you cant get backing on it sil vocnoise iver vocnoise sil no sil vocnoise sil 
and she said ya know and sil vocnoise sil and the hesword the last three 
or four years she just rode it out so she could retire sil vocnoise sil 
vocnoise sil and she used be very dedicated vocnoise sil noise sil uh very dedicated 
teacher she just sil noise sil it was a job then sil vocnoise sil and 
hesso i hate see that happen to good teachers iver right sil right when its 
just frustration after frustration vocnoise sil yeah that sil vocnoise sil yeah sil but i 
dont see that in the catholic school now in the catholic school theyre not even 
paid as well as the public schools sil vocnoise sil but the environment is sil 
better for education sil iver sil no sil iver well my son hesstarted sil vocnoise 
yeah i son started vocnoise public school for kindergarten vocnoise and he just sil my 
son is sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil my son is a very social vocnoise sil 
child well say cutoffhes sil hes the one that talks too much vocnoise as the 
teachers say hes the social sil child vocnoise he talks too much he likes to 
get up and run around and he needs something very structured sil i mean he 
needs time to run around but he needs something very structured you get him sil 
vocnoise near a bunch of cutoffkids other kids when he was little and it was 
like he would just run and scream at them cause he was ready to play 
vocnoise well sil vocnoise sil yeah and sil yeah my and my cutoffdaughter my daughters 
the opposite that vocnoise uh vocnoise but he would do that vocnoise sil and vocnoise 
so he wasnt sil he was very cutoffunknown he wasnt vocnoise learning things sil and 
he was constantly getting in trouble vocnoise sil it was like vocnoise sil i unknown 
i dont know sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil we would be told he was a 
sil problem but he didnt understand what was going on and it errorwasnt there wasnt 
structure he would go to school everyday and not know what to expect sil because 
there wasnt like sil this sil well do this and then well do this and 
well do this vocnoise so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized 
that way sil vocnoise sil and it just was a better cutoffmatch better match for 
him sil and then sil errorerrorwhen my daughter sil went to school was just easier 
to take them to the same school sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil cutoffand and that 
goes back unknown vocnoise reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about why 
the sil vocnoise discipline and sil and behavior may be different in the catholic school 
is vocnoise sil youre paying big sil youre paying bucks sil yknow its four cutoffthousand 
vocnoise forty five hundred dollars a year for sil us vocnoise to send her to 
school sil vocnoise sil uh sil and if we find out shes not doing her 
sil work sil its sil very different laughperspective iver vocnoise sil uh vocnoise yeah vocnoise 
sil vocnoise so i think shes getting a better education than he did but sil 
its because shes doing the work and and she knows shes expected to has to 
and vocnoise sil he sil my sons the kind hed rather play than work and 
so he vocnoise sil he rode a lot and vocnoise iver sil and he and 
he paid for it when he got to college it was rough cutoffstart for him 
to start out because he was behind then iver iver vocnoise sil no mean vocnoise 
sil noise sil iver oh they have religion they have a religion class they have 
religion everyday but some of it is just starting with prayer and bible stories and 
some its more the values sil vocnoise uh lot those teachers arent catholic sil which 
errorahvahi i was surprised to hear that sil vocnoise sil uh in fact the religion 
teacher that my daughter had in ninth grade she had religion class everyday wasnt catholic 
iver sil sil yeah i thought that was interesting sil uh so cutoffit it is 
a values sil yknow sil the the unknown christian sil values thing vocnoise uh vocnoise 
i dont have problem with we had little problems like my son had to learn 
the hail mary vocnoise and we had to find somebody to teach it to us 
vocnoise write it down for us because we didnt know and vocnoise sil they wrote 
it down wrong so he learned it wrong and he got marks off laugh and 
we and we didnt laughknow yeah little things like that vocnoise but it wasnt a 
problem vocnoise uh sil there was a problem vocnoise with my son for a while 
because the priest they had there wouldnt let him take communion and all the other 
kids were taking communion vocnoise and thats pretty much the priest decides that vocnoise sil 
and he sil and he felt noise vocnoise singled out sil and he was i 
mean he was the only one vocnoise and he was uncomfortable with that sil uh 
sil but it hasnt been a problem vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise im sil not 
a religious person myself sil but im not against it sil and if i hesand 
sil maybe ive justified it to myself by saying well theyre teaching values sil vocnoise 
vocnoise iver no well he right now hes really interested in eastern religions im not 
sure where that came from vocnoise yknow when they go to college and theyre gone 
and you dont see them much vocnoise sil uh vocnoise thats what hes interested in 
right now sil vocnoise so i dont think it it it it really took vocnoise 
iver right sil errorerroryeah and sil hesand hesand if my daughter doesnt seem ah iver 
yeah iver sil yeah vocnoise sil we have talked about some things that are sil 
vocnoise sil yknow the pope says this is sil what is and sil knowing full 
well that this is not what we think at home vocnoise we sil abortion and 
homosexuals and vocnoise were errorfwerif much more liberal than that and iver sil yeah sil 
cutoffclippingitjust thats where theres been a problem but were very open about that at home 
cutoffclippingandwith with vocnoise my daughter is strong willed vocnoise iver well no she sort of 
knows this is what she cutoffhas has to say at school vocnoise if shes asked 
on a test because she needs the points for a grade iver but she doesnt 
believe it vocnoise yeah yeah shes very pragmatic vocnoise sil cutoffyeahshe vocnoise cutoffimeanshe she could 
probably vocnoise iver vocnoise well shes shes interested in physical therapy sil is that what 
your wife is laugh oh laughokay iver and so you had iver physical therapist did 
it yeah noise iver but it fixed it iver yeah vocnoise sil drugs sil right 
vocnoise yeah so thats what shes interested in right now shes looking to see if 
she can find someplace to sil work this summer sil even if its just a 
day a week vocnoise some clinic or something just to sil to see whats goes 
on day to day iver whys that iver noise really iver you mean instead of 
a doctor iver huh iver i wonder if thats also socialized medicine there sil it 
is socialized isnt it iver yeah vocnoise unknown yeah my best friend lives in vocnoise 
on vocnoise outside canberra vocnoise and she has a lot of medical problems but sil 
huh iver theyre covered but it was real tricky because she sort of had some 
of she was a u s citizen sil she fell in love through email over 
the internet sil back in the early sil like nineteen ninety it was real early 
vocnoise and went over there and married the guy sil hesuh sil and so she 
had some of the medical problems when she emigrated and sil hesand vocnoise uh it 
was just sil it took years to get that straightened out vocnoise but shes covered 
now noise iver hm iver its medicare type thing iver yeah iver and as vocnoise 
more and more people are getting older and older there be more sil need for 
it laugh it be a lot of things theres gonna be more need for as 
people get older vocnoise iver tests sil uh yeah iver yeah sil well and i 
think chiropractors will be vocnoise more popular for the same type of reason sil yeah 
sil huh iver i uh ive gone to one but i had a back problem 
thats how unknown dealt with it vocnoise and it worked iver the same thing yknow 
i think theyre terrific vocnoise for the right things vocnoise sil yeah iver oh okay 
vocnoise iver oh you dont ask an easy one do you laugh thats a thats 
really iver yeah thats i mean thats really a tough one vocnoise uh because its 
sil unknown vocnoise i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no 
easy answer vocnoise um sil vocnoise and yknow i dont think its violence on tv 
vocnoise i dont think its working parents i think extits sil and i dont know 
what it is vocnoise it seems to be something more pervasive than sil could be 
solved easily sil um vocnoise hesi sil hesi i dont know its a tough one 
and sil vocnoise unknown i mean your daughter sil uh you said sil daughters yeah 
vocnoise is still young so you have to deal with but is scary vocnoise you 
send your kid to school and you hear these things and its just vocnoise no 
matter where it is in the country or the world vocnoise you hear of it 
yknow sil vocnoise sil really worries you iver heswell sil vocnoise im very sil much 
in favor of gun vocnoise control very strong gun control vocnoise um sil unknown i 
it they just seem to be too available vocnoise hesuh sil but then some of 
the things that the schools are doing about it sil know the kid who comes 
to school with a paper gun gets sil suspended thats sil a little much but 
iver i dont know i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he 
had a paper vocnoise he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 
iver and was threatening kids with it sil and so they suspended him iver yeah 
vocnoise uh vocnoise its it to me thats sort of a slap on the wrist 
and you tell the parents what youve done it what the kid did and you 
dont want him to do it again and let it go vocnoise they suspended him 
i dont know vocnoise course sil vocnoise um i probably say this vocnoise i got 
this version of the story from the columbus dispatch so its probably not the whole 
story vocnoise yeah vocnoise it it is unknown iver well vocnoise and if you want 
something local thats all you unknown got vocnoise i mean theres one paper iver vocnoise 
i dont even read it much laugh vocnoise its very conservative very republican sil yeah 
iver noise iver then theres vocnoise probably columbus its iver its vocnoise its the democrat 
laugh iver yeah franklin county usually votes differently than the rest of vocnoise at least 
the metropolitan areas of the state iver yeah iver oh okay iver yeah iver vocnoise 
i vocnoise iver well and its not just in the schools its in society vocnoise 
hesum vocnoise i mean violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things 
vocnoise and i extits sil i i just sil cant vocnoise cutoffiits its hard to 
imagine that the sil theres an easy fix if there is a fix i vocnoise 
its kinda frustrating because vocnoise you cant point to one thing and say this is 
what needs to be fixed vocnoise yknow its pervasive sil hesuh its like the noise 
i dont know if youve heard about this in the news a woman sil two 
of them were having an argument and one of vocnoise one of them set fire 
to the other one iver it was real close to my home laugh iver its 
the grocery we laughuse laugh yeah laugh iver vocnoise no i havent been over there 
since then laugh iver yeah sil hesuh sil but its like vocnoise i mean you 
sil theres these stories almost everyday you hear them sil and thats sil i mean 
thats even a big change from five or ten years ago iver or maybe its 
sil well iver vocnoise or maybe its crime thats going down in the sense that 
its supplying vocnoise yknow its vocnoise criminals arent as active but theres more and more 
of these sil acts of violence vocnoise maybe its because theyre so dramatic sil that 
you notice it iver yeah vocnoise yeah i mean maybe break ins are down laugh 
sil or holding up seven elevens are down but sil then you hear these yknow 
sil murders iver and then they seem like random or just spontaneous hesand vocnoise sil 
theres no way cutoffwa nothing you can do in life to really avoid it except 
exthide vocnoise hide in your basement or something sil and thats unknown yknow vocnoise iver 
and thats not a life iver right vocnoise and you cutoffn got it walking down 
the street iver vocnoise iver yeah iver cutoffuth iver vocnoise there seems to be an 
awful lot of sil publicizing some of it i mean some of its pretty dramatic 
a woman setting fire to somebody what happened in columbine sil its very dramatic but 
vocnoise when it happened in columbine it was sil all that was on the extnews 
sil for a whole sil day cutoffiit cutoffseeseemed seemed like you sil anywhere you looked 
vocnoise thats where it noisewasthis thing noiseis sil noisecoming loose a little sil there vocnoise 
uh vocnoise and thats sil all you could see and it was like sil well 
how much do extyou sil how much new is there to say from minute to 
minute on every channel vocnoise how much do people really need to keep hearing it 
iver and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that 
in a lotta places they pick something thats sensational hesand sil keep cutoffm sil theyre 
making it sil even more sensational like sil when vocnoise hesuh vocnoise hesuh john kennedy 
died iver fortunately we were out sil we vocnoise werent sil in the country so 
sil we didnt know so sil we had sil heard just iver well we were 
uh vocnoise we werent that far we were in vancouver so its not that far 
away vocnoise we didnt hear about it for a couple days but i heard that 
thats sil all that sil was on vocnoise every aspect of his life every aspect 
of the search vocnoise did people really need to know that sil do they need 
to have it driven exthome vocnoise and i think in cutoffih and i think at 
that point thats where the media are just sil theyre sensationalizing it hesand iver vocnoise 
oh sil everyday vocnoise exteveryday vocnoise there was something vocnoise hesuh vocnoise its like sil 
vocnoise sil i felt felt like i knew more about clintons sex life than i 
knew about my own laugh laughyknowitsaboutthe laugh and it was far more then i wanted 
to know about anybody elses vocnoise hesum vocnoise where as yknow in the past theres 
been presidents who had affair the press never even acknowledged it even if they knew 
it sil i mean at least thats what sil ya we hear vocnoise um vocnoise 
and now thats sil the most newsworthy story out there vocnoise so i think yeah 
the press have a lot to do with it sil the media iver well hide 
in your basement i guess vocnoise and cutoffiim i cutoffmmean but i mean what vocnoise 
you can unknown iver vocnoise not as an individual vocnoise uh vocnoise well see thats 
a problem unknown vocnoise its hard to find a balance between censorship and sil yknow 
free flow of information vocnoise uh vocnoise and as long as people vocnoise i mean 
some people vocnoise like this information uh sil jerry springers still running vocnoise laugh which 
i i actually kind of enjoy watching laughonceinawhile when i get the cutoffchchance vocnoise its 
kind of vocnoise interesting to watch these excludepeople vocnoise um vocnoise but i mean vocnoise 
i mean where do you draw the line what people should see and not see 
vocnoise i dont know vocnoise i dont want somebody telling me i can see something 
or telling me what my kids can see vocnoise uh i thats my job sil 
and if i dont wanna see something on tv ill turn it off sil if 
i dont want my kids to see something on tv vocnoise well i have an 
argument vocnoise unknown vocnoise it used to be easy when they were little yknow now 
laugh yknow vocnoise youre dealing with a a twenty one year old an eighteen year 
old is not as easy iver yeah vocnoise iver yeah iver youre much bigger vocnoise 
and you can control the thing and keep it away from her vocnoise uh sil 
yeah but vocnoise but i dont want somebody else telling me what sil they can 
watch and not watch thats my job vocnoise but i dont know how you i 
mean the sil the media errorper supposedly i mean vocnoise may vocnoise not supposedly this 
may be the way it works the media presents this stuff and people watch it 
or read it cutoffjujust sil or whatever they dont vocnoise but its when its like 
the constant barrage that this is what you get vocnoise the monica lewinsky stuff and 
vocnoise every day there was a new twist on the story that vocnoise or they 
announced that the news was that there wasnt a news twist vocnoise yeah sil i 
dont care sil but you couldnt turn it off because thats all that was on 
iver vocnoise i dont know iver well they are now in a sense sil uh 
vocnoise its easier to sil to go somewhere else i think on the web on 
tv if you have yknow like vocnoise four news cutoffchachannels unknown four local news channels 
and theyre all saying the same thing vocnoise and emphasizing the same things theres no 
sil choice there if you want the news youre gonna get it one way or 
the other but on the web you can go somewhere else vocnoise uh sil and 
yknow major newspapers are all over the web vocnoise uh sil you can pick and 
choose and you can see different vocnoise perspectives on the same story from different parts 
of the country and sil i think you get a a wider view sil yeah 
iver well yeah iver yeah iver laugh iver vocnoise oh that was the monica lewinsky 
iver vocnoise i think its been good i mean the economy has been very good 
sil uh vocnoise it seems like society seems to be vocnoise improving vocnoise yknow even 
though we talked about this iver crime and stuff vocnoise i sil i mean a 
lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the 
republican years and carried over vocnoise um sil but people have been better off financially 
vocnoise overall sil uh vocnoise and i and i dont think hes made anybody i 
dont i wouldnt say hes made any unknown major mistakes vocnoise policy wise well sil 
yes the vocnoise his personal life sil laugh sil unknown vocnoise hes well vocnoise yeah 
vocnoise laugh iver hes really just vocnoise laugh sil yeah he just doesnt think through 
the implications of things real well in his personal life iver well sil yeah he 
does back down too often vocnoise i think sil uh vocnoise you uh sil well 
sil yknow the well the health insurance didnt have a chance vocnoise i mean cutoffiif 
vocnoise no matter what position he took on the health insurance trying to radically change 
things it wasnt gonna get through congress vocnoise and so yeah he backed down but 
i wouldve liked to have seen something else happen to it vocnoise but it was 
also he i mean he gave up because it was sil it was useless to 
fight it sil he didnt think it wasnt gonna get through congress vocnoise so sil 
why spin your wheels on that sil i mean he raised the issue vocnoise it 
was clear that it wasnt gonna go anywhere vocnoise and maybe itll cutoffccome vocnoise its 
i think its regrettable it hasnt come back sil yeah but sil hes sil pretty 
much out of the picture now vocnoise as of this week vocnoise um vocnoise the 
gays in the military vocnoise i mean theyve always been there sil laugh i really 
vocnoise uh theyve always been there vocnoise um vocnoise i dont have problems being around 
gays vocnoise um vocnoise i never have my vocnoise yknow vocnoise have a brother in 
law whos gay my vocnoise sons godfathers gay vocnoise its not a problem sil um 
iver oh clintons position on it vocnoise well he sort of backed down from what 
it was gonna be and then sil just hoped that it would drop and sil 
i mean what vocnoise what you hear and read lately is that it really hasnt 
changed much sil uh sil and it but again thats i think part of that 
too is societys not ready sil on some level to accept that sil i mean 
gays in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gay marriages 
and iver well uh iver was it was sil they actually had a law or 
they sil or was it referendum iver oh really sil i hadnt heard that sil 
vocnoise sil vocnoise know it it uh vocnoise some of it when clinton has backed 
down i think i vocnoise sorta summarized what i just said is vocnoise yknow for 
the health vocnoise insurance and reform with that sil all that health insurance vocnoise area 
vocnoise um sil yeah he backed down but it wasnt gonna happen sil so he 
could keep sil know the furor going for months and months or years vocnoise and 
sil still nothing was gonna happen it was the wrong time sil or cutoffmomove try 
to move on to something else sil uh vocnoise i think its regrettable it hasnt 
come back vocnoise like you said its like vocnoise well i made the one attempt 
and didnt go anywhere so lets let it drop and vocnoise count for somebody else 
to pick it up well vocnoise clintons in sil lame duck its vocnoise why cant 
he bring it back iver its a good cutofftitime i mean what are they gonna 
do vocnoise i mean hes been through enough hell on his personal life this cant 
be much worse i wouldnt think vocnoise uh and he does cutoffbaback he does back 
down i think too much on stuff like that vocnoise and sil yknow iver vocnoise 
thats a extlong time iver vocnoise if they cant say it in three months they 
cant say it in eight months iver oh george oh sil w vocnoise i dont 
know i havent vocnoise really formed an opinion i cant iver i cant see a 
lot of substance vocnoise uh vocnoise he seems to say what needs to be said 
at the time and then vocnoise sorta cutoffbabacktracks unknown not really backtrack its just like 
its not anything really firm vocnoise i mean with mccain and bradley they were saying 
they wanted to do this and this was what sil the points they wanted to 
make and that sil i dont hear that coming from bush iver well i dont 
sil i hear some of that from gore but not as much iver itll be 
a extlong campaign vocnoise i thought it was interesting that vocnoise that gore suggested cutoffthat 
cutoffrecorecommended suggested sil two cutoffcampaicampaign two debates a week and i just cant imagine vocnoise 
watching two debates a week for months laugh laughyknow its like vocnoise well sil at 
least they could get things out into the open but vocnoise i vocnoise they have 
the chance but who wants to watch that much vocnoise who has the time to 
watch that much vocnoise unknown iver yeah iver vocnoise i dont think we need eight 
months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries its 
just sil too long vocnoise uh sil people start tuning out vocnoise and theres only 
so much you can say vocnoise yknow its like the candidates sil arent really saying 
much new where if they have a more compact time they could be so id 
like to see them vocnoise see the time reduced sil vocnoise sil the conventions used 
to be interesting because they debated the platforms and vocnoise thats all settled now vocnoise 
noise and its just sort of a vocnoise sil yknow the celebration type stuff well 
thats not sil interesting vocnoise sil well sil they couldnt change and move the primaries 
sil like to may vocnoise iver well thats its competition to be earliest and the 
cutoffststupid vocnoise the federal governments trying to stay sil stay out of the states sil 
vocnoise face and vocnoise so again thats another one of those things that vocnoise just 
live with it i mean theres enough of theres enough things to do and fight 
in were it life but thats not worth it vocnoise ya know vocnoise iver vocnoise 
iver vocnoise thats vocnoise probably what ill do ignore it cutofftitill cutoffununtill till like sil 
vocnoise august or july and then start paying attention vocnoise sil iver sil iver vocnoise 
sil yeah sil vocnoise wait right unknown the amount of money that is spend is 
just sil vocnoise sil i could just cant imagine vocnoise uh ya know millions and 
millions have been spent already sil hundreds millions and vocnoise its just starting vocnoise sil 
vocnoise iver my background iver unknownwhatdoyou mean iver vocnoise yeah i grew up in columbus 
i was born here vocnoise uh went to went and here at sil o s 
u at cutoffschschool vocnoise for school as an undergrad vocnoise iver yeah i went to 
columbus public schools sil uh didnt vocnoise yeah vocnoise um um sil always over on 
the west side same area of town vocnoise always lived there cutoffssince live there now 
vocnoise um vocnoise came up here to o s u sil vocnoise um sil got 
my bachelors in uh sil english lit vocnoise and then went to case unknown western 
reserve for a masters vocnoise then i decided i wanted to go somewhere else in 
the country vocnoise after i got my library degree sil and the only job i 
could find was here in laughcolumbus iver it was a cutofftitight vocnoiseit was real tight 
job market for librarians then vocnoise laughhellyeah yeah iver vocnoise sil well its good now 
sil uh vocnoise well the web again has changed that theres vocnoise computers vocnoise have 
made a big difference sil uh its more exciting now vocnoise for people who in 
that area um sil vocnoise who are interested in sil vocnoise its more emphasis on 
sil information not books and vocnoise things cutoffaare going to the library its vocnoise getting 
the cutoffinforinformation vocnoise iver making information available so its vocnoise i think its attracting a 
different group of people and its sil its sil more interesting vocnoise um vocnoise but 
it was real vocnoise sil tough job market then so i ended up at the 
state library downtown sil vocnoise worked there for five years and decided i cutoffhahad sil 
wasnt anything else there for me vocnoise uh and got a job at this company 
excludename which was still relatively new there were like vocnoise hundred hundred and fifty employees 
iver vocnoise was in seventy eight vocnoise um vocnoise and then ive just sil i 
have vocnoise stayed there and its vocnoise grown a lot and the work changes its 
an interesting place to work because vocnoise uh vocnoise well first the job is almost 
a different job every year vocnoise sil because so many changes are happening were trying 
to stay out in front of what vocnoise in front of what library innovations in 
front of web sil and net errorinnervationsinnovations and trying to incorporate it all so its 
vocnoise it vocnoise ya know its sil kind of exciting because youre cutoffiin getting in 
on things that are really new and vocnoise trying to master it the project im 
working on now sil um vocnoise its trying to find a way cutoffsso sil to 
automatic to sil create data that describes sil web resources sil so that libraries can 
take this data and put it in their catalog and integrate it with the regular 
collection vocnoise and were doing a lot of vocnoise with a sil yeah it is 
its pretty sil its pretty neat project a lot of new things vocnoise who at 
sil uh java and the web laugh give us vocnoise opportunities do things that weve 
talked about before but vocnoise couldnt really do very well vocnoise so its pretty neat 
iver yeah vocnoise iver sil vocnoise well we didnt even have computers iver at our 
desks we had terminals that connected to a system iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise yeah it 
was vocnoise uh vocnoise and ya know you sil vocnoise and isnt very ya know 
it was very slow and vocnoise and vocnoise key in a few characters and send 
it and wait and unknown much different now vocnoise iver very different vocnoise laugh vocnoise 
uh vocnoise just been a lot of innovations and sil iver vocnoise mmhmm sil iver 
vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise my first job over here at the o s u 
main library was key punching vocnoise iver for the system they have now key punching 
the old card data into that sil that was my first sil first library job 
vocnoise iver laugh i started at the real bottom of it laugh iver vocnoise yeah 
sil and i dont cutoffreareally iver uh its iver yeah vocnoise you just sit at 
the computer and vocnoise key the data in or vocnoise well the system were doing 
now is you can put in like vocnoise um the address the u r l 
for a web resource vocnoise it goes out and extracts data analyzes whats there vocnoise 
and comes up with vocnoise ya know subject terminology and call numbers and sil presents 
it back to you and then you can edit and do whatever you want with 
it vocnoise so sil ya know its vocnoise its doing some of that vocnoise some 
of that the automatic assigning and sil subject headings and call numbers thats vocnoise thats 
a lot of vocnoisereresearch were doing a lot of research on that its vocnoise got 
a ways to go its getting better iver sil vocnoise um sil its i mean 
its a lot better than it was even a year ago sil iver vocnoise iver 
vocnoise uh vocnoise well we put all kinds of information out on our own website 
vocnoise which theres so much its very hard to find what you want sil ya 
know its vocnoise thats a constant problem with information is sil the more you put 
out there the harder it is to find what you want vocnoise but if you 
cant get to it vocnoise if its not out there you cant find it vocnoise 
uh vocnoise it its a problem for us and for libraries because theres just a 
barrage of what theyre getting and its not just from us its from the literature 
vocnoise uh vocnoise theres literally cutoffdodozens sil ya know vocnoise hundreds of library publications vocnoise 
uh sil and its a problem that vocnoise librarians are facing all the time they 
cant keep up sil vocnoise iver theres too much information and too much change vocnoise 
uh librarians vocnoiseseseem sil and this is against probably of the image of librarians are 
theyre very vocnoise very sil eager to embrace change vocnoise uh vocnoise internet came out 
and sil ya know sil and when it sil and when it got out of 
the area that was being used by universities or whatever for research thats what it 
was at first vocnoise librarians were right there they wanted more and more and they 
wanted to figure out what they could do with it vocnoise um when p cs 
vocnoise we didnt sil you know it was revolutionary when we announced we were gonna 
use i b m p cs vocnoise for access to the system and we provide 
you software you can do some of the work that you used to doing but 
sil with us vocnoise in your computer vocnoise and its like it was incredible that 
sil i mean sil we had trouble with the demand it was cutoffffantastic sil ya 
know like triple what we expected sil librarians were ready for it iver vocnoise yeah 
make their job earlier and faster vocnoise uh sil ya know and cutofflibrarianlibrarians libraries like 
sil so many other places especially at universities or vocnoise theyve seen budget problems and 
vocnoise the subscriptions for cutoffseriouserious vocnoise periodicals are just outrageous iver some of those vocnoise 
triple every year iver yeah vocnoise yeah they do sil vocnoise iver well thats what 
vocnoise thats what theyve done sil well theyve done that here too theyve done every 
university iver well iver right but the ones that are raising are the ones that 
are the standards in the fields vocnoise but sil right sil and but more and 
more those are also available sil on the web but you have to subscribe to 
them sil vocnoise so its still and institutional subscription vocnoise i mean thats a constant 
problem for the serials people everywhere i mean vocnoise just its incredible whats happened with 
the costs sil ya know sil i mean ive seen sil articles that say some 
of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year iver but if you do 
that to sil ten things its some but its in sil integral to the universitys 
collection vocnoise that really hits your budget vocnoise ya know sil vocnoise and then theres 
always the professor who wants a particular journal because they like it vocnoise iver that 
you really didnt need vocnoise because then you could get more bang for your bucks 
iver yeah vocnoise yeah iver yeah vocnoise yeah sil yeah we do a lot of 
inter library loan too vocnoise iver vocnoise thats it iver oh okay that was easy 
iver yeah it was easy vocnoise laugh iver yeah it was yeah it was interesting 
vocnoise iver i usually dont have trouble cutofftalkitalking excludefourfivesixseveneightnineten vocnoise sil is that vocnoise just 
to get a volume level sil iver sil vocnoise sil vocnoise iver excuse me vocnoise 
sil iver vocnoise iver laughyoudidntscrewit on right and iver yeah iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver

uh no not anymore laugh sil vocnoise iver noise sil vocnoise iver umhum sil vocnoise 
iver iver vocnoise oh yeah iver vocnoise ive uh one son nineteen vocnoise hes trying

vocnoise sil hes very creative uh sil very talented musically vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise 
sil he was taking lessons from um sil gene walker that teaches jazz saxophone here

of uh mental health problems iver errorcreepcrept crept up multiple sil health problems vocnoise sil 
he ran away for a while there was drug abuse vocnoise alcohol vocnoise sil and

went to columbus alternative which is considered one of the sil top high schools in 
the state and he was asked to leave sil vocnoise sil um he errorwimswas in 
a psych ward for a while vocnoise sil uh vocnoise in some ways hes seemed 
to have gotten it together vocnoise um vocnoise sil vocnoise uh hes working full time 
at united dairy farmers vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil vocnoise hes involved with an uh 
sil vocnoise very much involved with uh having a baby in another month vocnoise sil

her g e d sil is filling out forms now to start vocnoise go to

im vocnoise not sure which uh she cant convince him to cutoffgiget he says he 
needs the g have a g e d vocnoise but he vocnoise hasnt done anything 
about unknownidont sil think he vocnoise sil weve always had the feeling that he had 
a uh um sil vocnoise sil a fear of failing vocnoise sil because he was 
so good at anything that he really wanted to do vocnoise sil that the areas 
that he was not good at vocnoise math for unknownper instance is an example vocnoise 
sil he just got very frustrated with and just wouldnt try vocnoise sil vocnoise uh 
hes very talented hes had artwork published sil poetry published vocnoise sil um sil vocnoise 
hes won sil vocnoise sil he won a statewide award sil a gold medal for 
vocnoise bagpipe playing iver yeah vocnoise sil hes doing none of that anymore vocnoise so 
its very frustrating for us and the baby theyre giving up for adoption vocnoise so 
thats a vocnoise whole different sil problem vocnoise sil iver vocnoise iver vocnoise sil not 
really vocnoise sil uh hes come to accept it vocnoise sil but uh it was 
her decision vocnoise sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil yeah it was one thing to know 
that its the best thing for the baby unknownkid but its another thing vocnoise my 
wife and i are trying to deal with emotionally that sil vocnoise were very family 
oriented vocnoise that this is a grandchild well never sil get to see watch grow 
up and thats very hard on us vocnoise but its is an open adoption vocnoise 
sil uh theyve met the couple several times sil uh theyve promised to ya know 
send pictures and keep sil keep them updated and stuff like that so iver vocnoise 
sil unknownuhthey unknown uh westerville sil yeah sil vocnoise sil so vocnoise sil thats difficult 
for us to deal with iver vocnoise sil and and im gonna hold you to 
this confidentiality cause vocnoise very few people know about this iver vocnoise my brother knows 
about it and my mother and thats the only ones in my family that are 
even aware of it so vocnoise sil vocnoise sil vocnoise because vocnoise we just dont 
wanna be bothered with a lot of questions iver sil cause its hard for us 
to deal with vocnoise sil iver vocnoise sil cutoffnno sil no this all started long 
before that actually vocnoise sil just recently he seems to sil have accepted the idea 
that yes the babys gonna be born i i think he just kind of sil 
tried to ignore it for a long time but sil vocnoise laugh its all very 
obvious now vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil and shes vocnoise shes great iver we really 
like her and she has helped us straighten him around a lot vocnoise he has 
been under a psychologists care for about sil three years sil and a psychiatrist for 
about a year and a half sil iver vocnoise shes very bright shes very cutoffdidifferent 
she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her um sil parents divorced when she was 
about four vocnoise her mothers an alcoholic her father said that he would sil take 
her cutoffwwith sil vocnoise with him and then after they got divorced he changed his 
mind so shes pretty much raised herself sil vocnoise cutoffetits its a hesbig sil it 
vocnoise its terrible things what shes laughhad to go through vocnoise and shes made it 
very clear that sil she will not live with an alcoholic vocnoise sil and thats 
helped straighten him out some sil vocnoise sil and our feeling was never that sil 
the alcoholism or the sil vocnoise sil the drugs sil vocnoise sil was not the 
problem vocnoise noise and weve dealt with several counselors and thats all they wanted to 
deal with our vocnoise cutoffpromproblem has always been its a symptom sil vocnoise uh sil 
took the psychologist a year and a half but he finally vocnoise sil cutoffagreagreed vocnoise 
charlie is vocnoise hes very intuitive sil and cutoffeheven even as a toddler he could 
do this he cutoffwuwould sil hed sil seemed to be able to give adults what 
they needed from him iver as a toddler and its sil its not intentional its 
just the way he is vocnoise so he was able to circumvent anything that the 
psychologist was trying till he had finally admitted it yeah he had a problem sil 
and then things went much more smoothly vocnoise sil vocnoise and that theres still not 
sil really vocnoise sil convinced of the diagnosis cause theres multiple problems and vocnoise they 
havent ruled out that some of the other things yet vocnoise sil vocnoise he could 
he just knew how to get around anything vocnoise sil iver vocnoise yeah it its 
sil its laughdifficult laugh iver to deal with iver vocnoise iver vocnoise sil he was 
tough but he was uh he was always tough and we didnt realize it for 
years we didnt have anything to compare to hes the only one kid we got 
vocnoise sil uh he was vocnoise very vocnoise the psychologist told us that vocnoise ya 
know we were talked about things that happened when he was growing said you must 
had a terrible time cutoffgragrowing sil unknown raising him cause he was not an easy 
kid we didnt know any different iver vocnoise was our job iver so we laughdidit 
vocnoise sil vocnoise its well hes always had some problems its vocnoise um vocnoise sil 
his problems staying focused on things sil unless its something hes extremely interested in then 
you cant get him away from it vocnoise sil vocnoise um sil if its something 
he vocnoise its vocnoise sil vocnoise the vocnoise just an example in school he would 
sit there and vocnoise hed be rolling around on the floor and stuff while theyre 
trying to teach something in class or cutoffspesupposed sil working on a writing assignment or 
something vocnoise and half hour to work on it hed be sil the last five 
minutes vocnoise the teacher say you know you really need to get that done hed 
sil sit down and write it sil vocnoise excludein the fifth grade he was writing 
on a college level and vocnoise hed could do it that quickly sil vocnoise sil 
um sil vocnoise i think hes lost ground on that now but vocnoise sil vocnoise 
and that was just an example in the second grade vocnoise sil vocnoise the school 
he went to was an open classroom sil and uh vocnoise sil he had been 
through some couple the traditional schools already vocnoise and the sil excludethe principal said we 
had told the cutoffprenprincipal talked to the principal about the problems we were having with 
him sil vocnoise staying focused and she said well we can work with that well 
cutoffhahalfway about halfway through the year she says its not working vocnoise and they have 
an arrangement and with sil and vocnoise i doubt if most the cutoffppeople sil people 
in the cutoffschooschool parents in the school are even aware of this with childrens hospital 
sil the counseling center they set a room aside and they sil send counselors in 
once a month to work with the students vocnoise its open classroom vocnoise its experimental 
so theres people coming and going all the time and no but how we were 
never aware of it i i doubt if most the people are aware of it 
sil vocnoise sil and they met with us and then a week later they went 
and observed him sil and sil he was they were sil the teacher was telling 
a story and then asking questions about vocnoise and said he was sil the counselors 
said he was up and walking around and running around and sil playing with his 
shoes and stuff like that she said but if came time to answer the questions 
he knew every answer sil vocnoise sil so he said he that they decided not 
to precede at that time because vocnoise this is frustrating too vocnoise it was our 
wedding anniversary and my wife said now how about for our wedding anniversary sil we 
just get a good report for the whole week vocnoise but that was unusual sil 
vocnoise sil and he wasnt sil a bad kid iver hes just disruptive sil vocnoise 
sil and uh sil he said sil okay sil week later she said we didnt 
get any bad reports thank you and he said she said are you gonna continue 
he said yeah its a lot easier sil for the rest the year we got 
no bad reports from iver sil vocnoise first grade sil vocnoise sil the first grade 
teacher was aware of what he needed and but the principle wouldnt let her give 
it to him vocnoise to give him something had to do what everything anybody else 
in the class was doing vocnoise he was even tutoring some of the kids in 
first grade sil vocnoise and sil it sil the last grading period shed give him 
vocnoiseshshe everyday shed give him a cutoffmmath math sil paper to work on and he 
said i showed you i sil i know how to do this im not doing 
it sil iver sil vocnoise iver sil vocnoise we were up talking to her almost 
daily vocnoise sil vocnoise on the phone in her office vocnoise sil and the ya 
know the last week he cutoffsdsaid she said you know theres only one week of 
sil school left she said well i better do my work and sat down and 
did it sil iver vocnoise its sil extremely difficult to deal with vocnoise iver uh 
sil vocnoise and he had been through a counseling experience before and it cutoffjihjust and 
it sil vocnoise he just played along with it then sil to get out of 
it i think that sil vocnoise iver sil vocnoise iver vocnoise he does vocnoise sil 
and vocnoise his love cutofffuhfor vocnoise he unknown sil he vocnoise his music is extremely 
good he sil taught himself so he by ya know sil sixteen hes playing eight 
instruments sil very well sil vocnoise sil uh he just sil and he cant do 
that now where he lives now he lives with sil uh this excludeis another thing 
that boggles my mind vocnoise his uh vocnoise girlfriends mother she hes afraid her cutoffgirlfgirlfriend 
his girlfriend that her daughter was gonna run away so she lets them sleep together 
in their house sil vocnoise when she her daughter was fourteen vocnoise sil iver vocnoise 
sil uh sil iver sil vocnoise yeah iver its a little hard to accept vocnoise 
sil um vocnoise sil yknow i cutoffthingthink errorsits its its hard to know what hes 
going through sil vocnoise sil errorwawhat how much of it sil extis sil um sil 
normal sil teenage rebellion sil and how much of its just vocnoise iver vocnoise cutoffhhe 
sil and plus the mental health sil aspect of it and everything iver and some 
of thats controlled with medication now but sil not all of it sil because they 
because of the drug and alcohol they wont put him on some of the medications 
so vocnoise but as far as i can tell hes been pretty clear and clean 
on that end uh sil yknow like sil once she got pregnant they both stopped 
smoking sil vocnoise shes taking very good care of herself she uh vocnoise sil she 
sil lately has been going with him to the psychologist sil and oh sil uh 
weve been paying for it but we dont have a problem with that sil because 
hes laughgoing laugh vocnoise he likes the psychologist so vocnoise took a long time to 
get to that point but vocnoise sil uh sil so weve been talking to the 
psychologist about it and he said this should be sil errorshehe he said sil most 
people that raised in that background he said they go two different ways ones they 
vocnoise they just fall into the same sil uh pattern as their parents or theyre 
survivors she appears to be a survivor vocnoise uh sil shes never really had sil 
what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us 
vocnoise uh which im glad vocnoise uh sil and she we really like her shes 
sil really sil it sil we enjoy being with her but sil sometimes more than 
being with my son vocnoise uh iver so it sil its been very difficult sil 
for us particularly the last four years and sil about the time he ran away 
vocnoise was er between the time my father in law died and my mother in 
law died which was in a five month period so my wifes had an awful 
lot to deal with vocnoise um sil vocnoise shes had a lot to deal with 
in that time iver yeah iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise plus a lot of work stress 
that shes had and stuff vocnoise iver vocnoise uh she works at franklin university shes 
assistant vice president there iver vocnoise so theres been a lot of pressure there iver 
vocnoise every time she thinks shes got it fully staffed and everything covered somebody quits 
but uh vocnoise and thats what the main problems been iver vocnoise sil yeah vocnoise 
iver vocnoise sil i retired about uh four years ago vocnoise from the state i 
worked there for thirty years actually i started working for the state when i school 
here sil i worked here vocnoise and that cutoffccounted cutoffffor counted cutoffffor those five years 
counted towards retirement so i was able to retire early vocnoise and then the last 
uh about the last two and a half years ive been working the symphony sil 
in the box office sil started part time and then i was full time for 
a while and then vocnoise i requested to be cut back to part time again 
vocnoise because uh iver i dont need to work that many laughhours laughwhatthe sil laughimean 
iver vocnoise i sil right i didnt need to sil so i didnt want to 
vocnoise uh iver vocnoise im fifty two sil yeah iver vocnoise noise iver vocnoise i 
was forty eight when i retired vocnoise so its great sil its terrific iver uh 
iver vocnoise sil uh vocnoise all those years and vocnoise after i left at school 
sil here i was at the bureau of employment services i worked for about uh 
vocnoise twenty years sil with uh vocnoise research and statistics labor market information uh federal 
state programs collecting information on sil three different programs in that time vocnoise then i 
worked for about a year and a half on a special project sil uh sil 
they were automating the employment services activities and they were going in a complete different 
cutoffderdirection direction to match um sil job needs of employers and sil applicants vocnoise to 
vocnoise to get sil vocnoise more placements for interviews and that sorta thing vocnoise and 
i developed sil that vocnoise method the the mechanism that check lists and stuff i 
did uh sil worked on that vocnoise uh vocnoise and i worked for the last 
three years in jobs training sil uh for economically disadvantaged youth adults and dislocated workers 
iver vocnoise the sil uh sil technical assistance and policy end of it vocnoise and 
sil hated it vocnoise the other years were fine but those last three were pretty 
bad vocnoise uh vocnoise iver vocnoise cutoffyyeah oh yeah iver and they are actually offered 
an early retirement because the funds vocnoise i dont cutoffreremember sil you may not remember 
about three years ago vocnoise four years ago the sil the federal government was not 
gonna pass a budget and all this stuff so when that doesnt happen on budget 
errorunknown vocnoise sil cuts in at seventy five percent of what the previous year budget 
was or something like that vocnoise laughwhichwasactually more money than they were gonna give us 
before that vocnoise uh sil so sil they had to cutoffddo vocnoise they would either 
have go lay off people or offer retirement vocnoise so i took the retirement sil 
vocnoise sil because i was not happy there anyway sil so sil vocnoise then sil 
took couple months off and did some consulting sil was worked on a consulting project 
at a bordens for sil about six months sil vocnoise then when that project ended 
vocnoise just sil same time it ended my sil father in law was diagnosed terminally 
ill with cancer vocnoise and he needed daily treatments here in columbus and they dont 
sil they were from chilicothe so vocnoise uh sil i became his caregiver for about 
three months till he died sil vocnoise and then took a couple months off and 
started working part time at the symphony sil vocnoise have been since then iver vocnoise 
iver answered an ad in the paper sil uh sil but ive sung in a 
vocnoise well shawn sings in the symphony chorus too vocnoise ive sung in it for 
sixteen years iver um sil so i just you know was something i was a 
little familiar with anyway vocnoise uh vocnoise sil i was just looking for something part 
time iver so it worked out well iver vocnoise it is really is laughnot laughitreally 
vocnoise it really is great vocnoise iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver i just havent enjoyed 
it youre right yeah before that i was fine if i ever still it if 
i i made a mistake by applying for that one job i just wanted to 
get something different because i didnt wanna go back where i was well i wouldve 
been better off back where i was vocnoise i wouldve been better at the job 
for one thing vocnoise and i knew uh knew cutoffththe sil kind of insanity id 
be dealing with there vocnoise iver oh uh iver yeah yeah i applied for it 
and went after it aggressively iver vocnoise uh sil i was good in the laughinterview 
laugh i mean vocnoise i knew what i was doing i kind of wish i 
hadnt been as prepared but vocnoise uh noise sil vocnoise but it was vocnoise sil 
a lot of the cutoffpeoppeople i moved into a management position vocnoise i was in 
it was a lateral move wasnt even a pay raise or anything it was a 
lateral move vocnoise sil and the people that i was supervising some of them been 
doing it for twenty years sil vocnoise and they made it very clear to me 
that sil they knew the program and i didnt vocnoise sil iver and uh sil 
and cutoffyyou you know i was there for sil three months before i got hit 
with a vocnoise uh sil uh cutoffrarace sil hesrace discrimination suit and vocnoise but then 
i found out later this woman had vocnoise in the twenty years she been there 
had filed twenty suits so vocnoise vocnoise sil vocnoise vocnoisebrrr sil vocnoise sil vocnoise she 
couldnt cutoffunersunderstand accept the fact that you could just disagree with her vocnoise it had 
to be because she was black or she was an older woman or vocnoise noise 
vocnoise sil vocnoise sil you couldnt just disagree vocnoise had to be a reason there 
vocnoise but fortunately cutoffmmy vocnoise cutoffshuhshe she accused me of that in front of my 
boss who was black sil who sil didnt believe it vocnoise he knew better so 
iver yeah iver yeah it did and then she cutofftuh vocnoise but she was vocnoise 
kind of a gossip she went around talking to everybody trying to get them all 
support her and nobody would support her iver theyd uh heard it all before and 
they unknown sil some of them had known me for a few years vocnoise but 
sil uh vocnoise i was told errorlafterafter i retired that she was actually easier to 
get along with when i was there than anyone else vocnoise vocnoise i dont believe 
laughthat laugh laugh vocnoise yeah vocnoise umhum vocnoise iver vocnoise well i wasnt i was 
in cutoffmanagermanagement for about thirteen fourteen years and it wasnt bad where i was before 
vocnoise sil uh sil this management it was it was the whole department it was 
uh vocnoise i dont know what it was people they were always arguing and fighting 
it was just the whole sil vocnoise sil atmosphere like of that place and it 
was just vocnoise sil people that id known for years and gotten along well with 
were just sil they were different when they went in there they just changed it 
was just vocnoise it was just not a good place to work vocnoise iver yeah 
iver yeah vocnoise iver i think theres been a lot of mistakes made by everyone 
on that vocnoise sil and i really think sil vocnoise sil vocnoise even though i 
sil would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the 
right thing by taking him away from the cutoffothaother sil the cousins vocnoise i mean 
theyve the cousins have been stressing all along he needs family he needs family well 
theres not much closer family than your father vocnoise and that that that they love 
this country and this stuff well then sil vocnoise accept the laws and follow them 
whether you laughdont agree with them or not vocnoise um sil vocnoise i cutoffththink vocnoise 
i vocnoise i it was very unfortunate the way it happened uh but i think 
the government should sil vocnoise not unknown let it go on as long as it 
had iver vocnoise right iver its the way i feel iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise iver 
vocnoise iver vocnoise cutoffwahwe vocnoise we were talking about this at work one day and 
they said you know im cutoffsusurprised sil surprised you think that way because vocnoise i 
vocnoise tend to be a little left of center on most things vocnoise sometimes far 
left but vocnoise and vocnoise i said now this isnt vocnoise i she said vocnoise 
seems like that would be the conservative view my opinion the conservative view is vocnoise 
they dont want him to go back to cuba vocnoise not to the communism or 
vocnoise but people ive talked to even vocnoise extreme conservatives sil and liberals they all 
pretty much feel the same way that the ones ive cutofftatalkedto i havent heard anybody 
iver thats accepted the other vocnoise the cousins side yet iver right iver unknown yeah 
but it vocnoise the conservatives and liberals are all agreeing on this iver thats what 
iver i vocnoise its not a presidential cutoffississue candidate issue as far as im concerned 
but sil vocnoise sil uh vocnoise sil vocnoise im sil iver vocnoise oh yeah iver 
even my mother who is a vocnoise she said if nixon were running today shed 
vote for him shes that much of a conservative vocnoise uh vocnoise agrees with whats 
happened vocnoise but most people will say the same thing there should have been another 
way to get him out of there but vocnoise at this point i dont think 
there really was sil a vocnoise a few months ago yeah but iver i think 
the news media have hyped it up too much really vocnoise i mean we have 
an accord with cuba that says anyone thats vocnoise trying to escape from cuba to 
united states thats found at sea is immediately returned to cuba vocnoise whether you agree 
with it or not vocnoise thats the accord and thats what cutoffkee thats what sil 
castros vocnoise sil vocnoise thats the premise hes operating on vocnoise uh sil you know 
and the news media they havent really been sil a vocnoise cutoffjijust vocnoise they just 
sil they havent been real objective about it vocnoise i mean vocnoise uh vocnoise you 
know like there two fisherman that sil found him at sea you never hear about 
the other one because that this was on one sil just briefly i heard on 
the news because vocnoise he thinks he should go back to his father sil but 
you dont hear about him vocnoise theres three cousins two of them think he should 
stay vocnoise miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you 
dont hear about him vocnoise i was reading about him vocnoise news week or someplace 
vocnoise uh vocnoise so i think the news media is not been vocnoise totally objective 
about this iver vocnoise oh sure iver im sure vocnoise uh iver vocnoise right iver 
its its sil its more a vocnoise it tends to be more of entertainment vocnoise 
i dont remember that being that way thirty years ago but sil it does now 
vocnoise iver right vocnoise well vocnoise thats something ive noticed in the local news particularly 
errorlatrihlately they say exclusively on our channel and stuff sil and its usually not that 
big of a deal what theyre talking about uh but theyre making a big point 
that you heard it here first and vocnoise i mean if you hear it five 
minutes earlier on one station than another what difference does it make iver vocnoise im 
just kind of appalled what they put on the news anyway its not vocnoise sil 
usually what i consider news vocnoise its lot a human interest stories and things like 
that which iver unknown nationals getting that way too theyre all heading that way anymore 
vocnoise uh sil used to be an sil analysis with the news you dont get 
that at all anymore vocnoise iver right vocnoise the vocnoise kind of the u s 
a today syndrome iver light news vocnoise uh vocnoise sil thats why i read vocnoise 
tend to read the alternative newspapers and things because you do get a sil different 
perspective its vocnoise its vocnoise sil probably just as slanted vocnoise but it is different 
vocnoise youre right iver vocnoise uh usually whatever ones i can find uh vocnoise hey 
you got vocnoise columbus alive and vocnoise sil just not quite that iver yeah the 
local ones more than anything vocnoise uh vocnoise iver sil vocnoise oh no never have 
iver years ago there was a cutoffcitizcitizen i dont know if you were unknown what 
your background is where you cutoffwewere sil cutoffih sil were here but or not but 
sil citizen journal was a daily paper vocnoise and it was sil it was the 
opposite of the dispatch vocnoise was much more liberal vocnoise they used this and sil 
it sil it was a morning paper and the dispatch is an afternoon paper vocnoise 
evening paper vocnoise and uh sil they shared the same facilities vocnoise the same printing 
presses and everything and then dispatch sil when their lease expired wouldnt renew their lease 
iver vocnoise uh sil and at least it gave you a lot different sil view 
iver vocnoise sil uh but the dispatch sil the only reason i get the dispatch 
is i do wanna know whats going on locally iver vocnoise you iver right you 
vocnoise you you cant really ignore vocnoise ive heard people say i refuse to read 
the dispatch well you got to know whats going on locally im sorry vocnoise but 
uh iver the day your trash is picking up vocnoise what movies are playing vocnoise 
uh sil vocnoise but i dont really rely on heavily for news iver even they 
dont get facts right a lot of time sil uh sil vocnoise iver vocnoise oh 
not very right on vocnoise and sil i would vocnoise twenty the twenty years the 
first twenty years i worked at the bureau vocnoise i was worked in statistics sil 
so i learned a lot about sil numbers and how to use them and vocnoise 
what you can do with them how sil easily theyre misinterpreted vocnoise and my wife 
vocnoise does it it has been a director of institutional research at the university sil 
vocnoise um vocnoise data sil research sil uh uh vocnoise they dont really have other 
kinds of research there vocnoise um iver and she says sil its amazing you can 
vocnoise give these cutoffpeppeople give people numbers sil and they immediately sil vocnoise sil use 
them wrong vocnoise they just dont know how to use them sil vocnoise uh they 
vocnoise completely misinterpret even though its very clearly stated what theyre doing sil and uh 
vocnoise the newspapers do that a lot too iver vocnoise iver people want a number 
sil they dont wanna know the methodology that goes into it sil or the the 
disclaimers or footnotes sil they dont wanna read the footnotes they want a number vocnoise 
uh vocnoise when i worked for the state one program we worked on was uh 
occupational employment statistics which was collecting uh sil numbers employees by different occupations in different 
industries in different areas sil of ohio sil uh sil vocnoise which actually used sil 
originally started here the university in ohio it was a federal program department labor it 
was administered state level vocnoise and uh sil it didnt sil didnt turn out very 
well so they switched it over to me vocnoise uh vocnoise sil for a variety 
of reasons which is not entirely the universitys fault vocnoise um sil vocnoise sil they 
had to rely on confidential information which we couldnt give them because it was confidential 
sil vocnoise uh vocnoise sil by federal law it was confidential we couldnt give it 
to them sil but they needed it vocnoise so it cutoffjujust it was just not 
a good one sil good way to do business vocnoise vocnoise uh sil vocnoise sil 
and we would present information ok there vocnoise for cutoffinsinstance vocnoise theres this this number 
of people in an occupation vocnoise vocnoise but there was also a range of error 
on there where people wouldnt notice that vocnoise and they would take that number as 
gospel sil and you just could not convince them that sil well it really means 
more than that vocnoise uh the big one would be uh wage levels and we 
didnt really vocnoise at that time collect wage data so if we were kind of 
a conduit for vocnoise theres several different departments in the sil the state sil and 
the federal government collect vocnoise occupational data and we were kind of a conduit for 
the state for that vocnoise um sil people would they wanted an hourly rate they 
didnt want a range they didnt want vocnoise they uh they wanted a number and 
thats what that was gospel vocnoise but its based on survey data so and and 
you know theres always statistical error in there and stuff sil and sil try to 
explain that to we spent more time sil uh sil when people call up and 
give information explaining vocnoise sil this is what this really means then the just giving 
them the number sil that we spent more time doing that sil uh iver vocnoise 
i think a lot of people dont sil understand vocnoise a lot of people dont 
vocnoise sil its a mindset sil uh sil uh vocnoise they dont wanna deal with 
sil numbers a lot of people or they want something easy and simple vocnoise and 
thats what theyre looking for sil they dont really wanna know sil what it means 
sil uh sil vocnoise and a statistic under vocnoise any sil cutoffterterm uh any sil 
definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind iver and people sil 
dont seem to understand that sil vocnoise uh its not like youre sil collecting data 
for a hundred uh the the entire population of the entire universe you youre working 
with a sample trying to vocnoise represent the entire universe well sil sometimes vocnoise its 
good and sometimes its not iver they tried sampling vocnoise well my brother rich was 
one of the families they sampled iver yeah sil and it just didnt work iver 
and uh and the sil data they collect is just sil i mean vocnoise well 
i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of 
detail but vocnoise the basic vocnoise sil data has essentially how many people live in 
the household and what are their ages and race and thats it vocnoise and thats 
not a sil i dont think thats a big secret myself but iver vocnoise right 
iver vocnoise and uh sil i think sil uh some of my feelings about that 
sort of thing is uh vocnoise is is sil colored by the fact that i 
collected data sil for twenty years from sil employers vocnoise uh sil im a lot 
more sympathetic sil to that sort of thing vocnoise um sil vocnoise yeah just lot 
more sympathetic to people collecting data sil vocnoise iver yeah sil right iver vocnoise i 
had did one time iver i had somebody call and they were doing a survey 
and they wanted know what i did for a living and when i told them 
they said well were done laugh iver laugh laughwere were finished laugh vocnoise iver vocnoise 
right sil iver sil oh sure sil yeah sil iver sil oh sil laugh sil 
iver vocnoise thats not enough laugh iver sil vocnoise iver sil iver vocnoise sil yeah 
and hesunknown and i think it could work sil uh but i dont think people 
were sil ready to accept it sil vocnoise and if sil the people cutofffillifilling giving 
the information arent ready to accept it then sil iver its not gonna work sil 
iver vocnoise sil im not sure sil uh sil vocnoise sil im not sure that 
the sil vocnoise sil the federal government has the vocnoise sil ability to convince enough 
people sil to do it sil vocnoise sil and i dont think its i i 
think the people that are going to be sil ready to accept it sil vocnoise 
sil and vocnoise go with it are vocnoise sil vocnoise i dont think excludeyoure gonna 
get a sil good cross section population sil i think the people would be willing 
to understand it and go with it more if gonna be the more educated in 
this sort of thing then youre leaving out a large part the population so im 
not sure its gonna give valid results anyway sil iver period sil and its thats 
a long process i mean this has been going on for two hundred years this 
way sil vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise and people are suspicious of government sil asking 
questions noise sil iver vocnoise oh yeah and you just you just send that right 
on over but if you dont want to tell how many people live in your 
house iver vocnoise iver right vocnoise yeah iver vocnoise sil see checking to see what 
kind of things youre ordering where youre vocnoise hits are on the inter net sil 
and iver vocnoise iver sil thats just because its in the name of government sil 
theyre suspicious and uh sil vocnoise sil iver vocnoise iver vocnoise sil yeah sil iver 
sil iver vocnoise its sil difficult you feel alone a lot of the time vocnoise 
um sil vocnoise sil and im not as liberal as i used to be sil 
uh sil its i think cutoffsomebsomebody vocnoise sil with age it gets tempered a little 
bit sil but still sil vocnoise tend to be a little more liberal and its 
uh vocnoise sil you know sil it doesnt matter who i vote for theyre gonna 
lose vocnoise uh sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil vocnoise sil and i just stay out 
a lot of sil laughdiscussions vocnoise was cutoffinterestinteresting my vocnoise our mother raised us sil 
in a way that we were always allowed to discuss sil politics and religion anything 
we wanted to vocnoise uh but you know shed stop if we got to excludethe 
point where we were vocnoise getting physical or name calling or something like that and 
it was vocnoise long sil vocnoise sil after i left home i actually before i 
realized that not everybodys laughthatway vocnoise not everybody wants to hear your views vocnoise sil 
um sil vocnoise so i cutoffihin particularly around my in laws theyre very conservative sil 
of southern ohio sil uh vocnoise raised during the depression vocnoise sil um sil in 
a depressed area sil so it sil ive learned vocnoise my mother in law vocnoise 
sil took anytime you disagreed with her as a personal attack on her so sil 
vocnoise i just learned sil vocnoise sil youre not to say anything vocnoise yeah sil 
uh sil my father in law wasnt that way but my mother in law was 
sil vocnoise iver sil iver sil iver vocnoise iver vocnoise sil i think iver i 
think they do vocnoise sil vocnoise unknownwhoknows sil iver sil vocnoise sil iver sil vocnoise 
iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise my uh vocnoise sil my brother in law was very much 
opposed to any kind of gun control sil vocnoise uh the whole family was hunters 
hunters and things like that and now my vocnoise father in law was a hunter 
sil but he was not opposed to gun control either sil uh sil as long 
as he could hunt iver sil vocnoise sil and uh sil and theyre not the 
kind that would go out and just shoot any animal unknown shoot it they would 
sil vocnoise sil use it food they sometimes they sil vocnoise sil i know one 
time that sil they gave it to a family that was uh didnt have any 
money and didnt have any food they did sil went and killed some animals and 
gave it to and i dont have a problem with that vocnoise uh sil vocnoise 
sil uh sil but my brother in law was very much opposed to sil any 
kind of gun control sil he sil he believes whatever charleton heston tells him vocnoise 
iver sil iver vocnoise iver vocnoise uh i think that iver i think that that 
you with all the violence in the schools and that sort of thing i think 
people are starting to look at it a little differently iver vocnoise yeah and its 
not vocnoise i mean it gets it sil any is too much but its not 
that big a proportion that its happening vocnoise but i remember even my son the 
third grade somebody kid brought a gun to school iver yeah iver he went to 
columbus schools uh sil uh sil and the kid didnt know what he had he 
just found it laying around sil his fathers car in the sil glove compartment vocnoise 
brought it in to show the other kids vocnoise uh sil that was very upsetting 
to my son hes very sensitive sil uh sil he used to be laugh vocnoise 
again i dont know if thats normal for teenagers or not but he used vocnoise 
used to be very sensitive to other people and sil but uh sil vocnoise i 
dont think i vocnoise i dont know if he is or he just doesnt sil 
wont let him be himself be right now but iver right vocnoise sil uh sil 
vocnoise iver oh yeah sil and thats normal we understood that we errorkacame knew we 
knew a lot of stuff we were gonna vocnoise we raised him to be very 
independent sil and i always said that were gonna regret this someday vocnoise i said 
another ten years well be pleased but vocnoise uh sil we were not particularly raised 
either of us my wife or i to be very independent vocnoise uh so it 
gets to point that sil when we were first married pretty it was hard to 
make it simple decision on anything vocnoise vocnoise yknow weve worked through that after twenty 
five years but vocnoise uh sil or to stand on our own or anything but 
sil you know we learned to do it but sil we always he was always 
very independent sil vocnoise his teachers said sil independent we said it said stubborn but 
vocnoise its like even sil go to mcdonalds or something and he was vocnoise didnt 
want onions on anything he sil if he ordered a sil a happy meal without 
onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even 
as sil six and seven years old and sil and tell them iver vocnoise sil 
uh sil which heswe we encouraged that iver because we could know that sil hell 
need that someday i would never have done it iver vocnoise iver vocnoise but it 
uh he he would hes vocnoise iver and hes very opinionated vocnoise and its interesting 
when he talks about sil uh sil anything sil he loves to talk about politics 
and social issues and that sort of thing vocnoise sil uh sil you can tell 
that hes thought hes uh thought about it sil and his sil yknow clearly formulated 
what his stance is on it vocnoise and hes sil very articulate about it vocnoise 
uh vocnoise sometimes sil his responses are immature but hes nineteen iver i mean vocnoise 
im sure at nineteen i was saying some really bizarre things too vocnoise uh but 
you can tell that hes thought about it iver so sil vocnoise because he and 
i always discuss sil politics and stuff vocnoise iver vocnoise he had cutoffvavariety vocnoise a 
variety vocnoise uh sil eighth grade is when he was probably in some ways his 
better year sil uh sil he was taking a cutoffcomcomputer sil had taken computer class 
for grading period vocnoise sil and um sil vocnoise it wasnt going well they were 
teaching keyboarding well he learned that when he was in third grade sil vocnoise so 
we were talking to the teacher about it says well hes disruptive hes supposed be 
doing keyboarding exercises and hes writing programs vocnoise vocnoise vocnoise so anyways sil and he 
said i knew the first day he was in here he knew every cutoffththing thing 
that i was gonna teach this unknowncouldntdoanything sil grading period well that sil kind of 
flew up a red flag to me and laugh vocnoise can you give him other 
assignments vocnoise oh no hes got do what everybody else is doing vocnoise so we 
went to the principal and sil i was sil president of the sil uh parents 
advisory committee at the time so i had an easy access to the principal vocnoise 
he took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library and 
the librarian worked sil with him one on one teaching data base and spreadsheet vocnoise 
uh sil applications to him vocnoise but then sil but he had another teacher in 
the ninth grade who contacted us his english teacher vocnoise and errorheshe she cutoffsesaid said 
told us uh said he knows everything i wanna teach vocnoise so i want your 
permission to give him a separate curriculum and she did she but he was sil 
using reading books like invisible man sil my cutoffeellimon sil ellimen ellison vocnoise ralph ellison 
sil and ellimen guess it is vocnoise anyway um sil vocnoise and writing papers on 
it he was reading like three books by an author and then trying to write 
a short story in that authors style vocnoise and she still tested him with the 
other kids just make sure she hadnt missed any he hadnt missed anything vocnoise and 
she was he was using her grad school notes to write papers and stuff like 
this sil and uh sil it was sil he loved it vocnoise and thats what 
he needed vocnoise though when he got to high school sil and we would talk 
to teachers about they said no they couldnt do that vocnoise uh it was very 
frustrated sil frustrating iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver in the kin iver in uh sil 
first grade his teacher sil knew that he needed that but the principal would not 
allow her to do it sil and thats one reason we put him in different 
school for second grade vocnoise uh iver right iver yeah and uh sil in the 
eighth grade he took the ninth grade proficiency test and passed all four parts sil 
the first time vocnoise uh sil so he was learning what they vocnoise sil were 
sil teaching which and thats another problem teaching to a test but vocnoise um sil 
thats a whole different problem vocnoise uh sil iver right iver and you learn what 
you have to to get through the test course i did that sil when i 
was here at school iver uh sil if was a class i sil knew i 
had to take i didnt really want to vocnoise thats what you do vocnoise uh 
you just get through it sil uh vocnoise iver umhum vocnoise yeah iver i was 
bored in high school and i wasnt all that bright iver vocnoise and uh he 
needed sil that but uh if i uh iver it it was difficult sil uh 
sil vocnoise i cant tell you how many times he had papers or projects due 
at school that wed just have to sit there with him to keep him focused 
on doing it vocnoise its sil one of the sil uh diagnosises probably vocnoise a 
d h d which has trouble vocnoise with uh working memory how and how to 
get a project done and stuff like that vocnoise uh we taught him how to 
do time lines and vocnoise errorgatgot charts and things like that vocnoise um sil but 
it was very difficult for him be task oriented iver and it still is vocnoise 
uh and that was the problem with school he just wouldnt do the work sil 
i mean he give him a test and he could pass it vocnoise do really 
well but sil he just wouldnt do the work sil iver well he wasnt really 
diagnosed then until just the last couple years uh sil and part of the problem 
was it was fairly new and everybody was being diagnosed a d h d uh 
and it wasnt really there werent really good screening instruments for that there are now 
sil uh vocnoise and weve often felt that he needed to have vocnoise sil gifted 
vocnoise emphasis for gifted children because vocnoise uh sil and the uh sil the schools 
wouldnt do that for him because his grades werent good enough because he didnt do 
the work iver vocnoise and sil the state of ohios definition of sil a gifted 
child is uh anyone who goes scores seventy percent or higher on sil some test 
that they give vocnoise well uh yknow they saying half the students in columbus schools 
were gifted students now thats not sil it cant its impossible vocnoise gifted students theres 
fourteen different characteristics to look at you cant just look at sil one thing iver 
and vocnoise one of them theyd looked at in columbus was vocnoise uh sil how 
well he was doing in school sil well gifted children you sil cutoffofteoften have the 
high uh one of the highest drop rate of sil out rates in schools theyre 
not doing well vocnoise so they need to be taught differently sil and then they 
cut this moneys uh vocnoise cutoffmumy my feeling is you know theres lot of unknown 
programs in school theres sponsored by the federal government particularly sil vocnoise uh to help 
the the students are that are behind and thats important iver and it should be 
important but there needs the students that are the other end need the help too 
vocnoise lot of people think if you have a child thats gifted that all your 
problems are solved but its not its a different set of problems theres personality quirks 
that go with that emotional issues vocnoise iver right iver and the theyre not willing 
to do that for gifted students iver only if for those unknown students who are 
cutoffachuacheivers high achievers who are very bright vocnoise talented may be truly gifted vocnoise who 
are willing to vocnoise jump through the hoops iver and those the and the other 
students were lost vocnoise to the system sil and thats what happened with him iver 
and and its just iver yeah iver vocnoise well we figure in a few years 
he will sil um iver thats what we figure in a few years hell be 
fine sil its just getting there sil its been very difficult vocnoise i mean theres 
times when we didnt know where he was sil for sil a week at cutofftaytime 
a week at a time he vocnoise i was driving vocnoise sil lane avenue once 
and saw him begging money on the street and sil thats sil its its hit 
pretty heavy load to go through it really is iver right iver no i had 
no idea where he was sil uh and at the time vocnoise my mother in 
law was in a nursing home had alzheimers and my father in law was in 
the hospital iver vocnoise uh essentially dying sil and so we were dealing with all 
of this vocnoise at the same time and it was i mean there was one 
night i remember we were ready to leave the hospital about seven thirty we checked 
to see if there was any messages at home to see if wed heard from 
him vocnoise uh sil and got a message that my mother in law had fallen 
and she was in an sil emergency room the same hospital fortunately so went down 
there vocnoise then on the way home sil got a phone call on the cell 
phone vocnoise uh sil from the hospital that my father in law had to had 
some bleeding so we had to go back to hospital sil and then we went 
around driving around looking for my son this was all and this was not unusual 
vocnoise it was a horrible period sil vocnoise and uh vocnoise i think what sil 
made my wife and i the angriest was that hes the only one that really 
could control his behavior the others couldnt iver vocnoise and their needs were sil immediate 
iver hes admits now that he felt neglected at that period iver well sil how 
he felt and knowing that werent neglecting him were two different things vocnoise weve always 
emphasized that sil vocnoise sil knowing whats right sil or knowing that vocnoise whats just 
is one thing its dealing with the emotions is another one iver vocnoise like dealing 
the with this adoption of the baby we know that thats best but dealing with 
the emotions of it this is a you know its grand vocnoise were very family 
oriented vocnoise and its this is a grandchild well never see iver and its very 
hard on my wife and i sil but well get through it sil iver vocnoise 
right vocnoise iver yeah vocnoise its uh well youre right vocnoise iver yes sil so 
its tough to go through but sil vocnoise he uh i guess he always did 
take things a little on the extreme iver so its vocnoise probably wasnt unexpected we 
just werent prepared for it i dont think you could be prepared for it vocnoise 
iver vocnoise right and he just pretty much sil cut ties with all of his 
old friends and vocnoise we still see them all uh a lot vocnoise and we 
were close with their parents and iver hasnt for about four years he refuses to 
vocnoise refuses to live with us vocnoise because we have rules iver vocnoise he seemed 
confused sil parenting with controling iver vocnoise i mean we would like when he was 
fourteen years old we wouldnt let him go out and take a walk at cutoffeleleven 
three in the morning and he couldnt understand that laugh im laughsorry laugh i dont 
think thats being vocnoise a bad parent vocnoise sil to tell you no sil vocnoise 
sil uh iver iver right vocnoise iver and he did that too sil uh iver 
no and he iver yknow he had he had vocnoise iver he vocnoise was living 
with this one family for a while vocnoise um vocnoise sil and they were nudists 
and taking him to nudist camps and stuff like this unknownandithought vocnoise cutoffwawhat sil what 
do you think they would vocnoise they never had any contact with us they just 
let him move in vocnoise can you imagine letting your sil fourteen year extolds friend 
just sil move in sil and not sil find out why or laughanything iver i 
just vocnoise he uh he did vocnoise talk to one of his friends who sil 
he wasnt really a cutoffw did cutoffwa didnt really know that sil this friends mother 
and i grew up together sil vocnoise uh so he was sil he sil asked 
if he could move into their house and the mother said there were three things 
sil one i need something in writing from your parents vocnoise two i need to 
talk to your parents vocnoise and three there are rules youll have to obey iver 
of course that never happened iver vocnoise iver i think he really does iver uh 
yknow hes paying rent at his mother in law sil hesas wasnt not really his 
mother in law but in her vocnoise so she can vocnoise sil right sil uh 
sil hes he has become more responsible sil but responsible about a lot of things 
vocnoise which is again sil cutoffnnormal sil at normal maturation vocnoise and hes just doing 
it the hard way iver he was sil yknow pretty much promised a free ride 
through o s us music program vocnoise and he turned that vocnoise and hes thrown 
that away sil and i vocnoise vocnoise i dont even know if he regrets that 
sil i really have no idea vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise he just doesnt want 
talk to us about things like that vocnoise he does talk to vocnoise his girlfriend 
about it and shes become very close with my wife vocnoise shes sil never had 
an adult sil really the vocnoise um a mentor of any kind even vocnoise my 
cutoffwiwife she wants to go to sil school my wifes vocnoise agreed to go with 
her when she goes for the interviews and stuff sil cutoffsshe sil she says she 
doesnt know what to ask or anything and iver course my wifes worked in higher 
education for thirty years so vocnoise iver and she wants go to columbus state sil 
vocnoise uh wants to get into vocnoise one of their engineering tech programs sil um 
sil um hum sil vocnoise sil and i i hope she does sil um sil 
cutoffcabecause she cutoffbebecause vocnoise sil she never fit in in high school she is very 
bright sil shes vocnoise mature in cutoffsosome many ways but shes had to be responsible 
for herself her whole life vocnoise um sil vocnoise iver but she was never interested 
in vocnoise sil and never really interested in boys or in sports in high school 
sil or uh sil make up sil and clothes and things like that and sil 
yknow cutoffyoyoure vocnoise youre setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that vocnoise 
and thats what happened shed come home in tears because kids made fun of her 
and stuff and finally sil she just stopped going sil and within a couple months 
sil she got her g e d iver vocnoise may be kind of hard in 
a sil when she gets into a sil engineering tech program because she hasnt had 
all a the sil math prerequisites sil because she just didnt stay in school long 
enough iver vocnoise iver i iver i think she yeah she will iver and cutoffsheshes 
and shes very determined vocnoise uh sil vocnoise she has said that sil cutoffhahad vocnoise 
having this being pregnant having this baby has made her focus on things a lot 
differently vocnoise she cutoffdoedoesnt she doesnt wanna go back to being the way she was 
before she doesnt want go back to the vocnoise the drugs and the smoking and 
the drinking iver vocnoise iver cutoffhuwell cutoffeverytheverything uh cutoffththe all focus changes it really does 
iver and it never goes back to the way it was before did you just 
know that theres someone thats completely dependent on you for sil everything iver everything you 
do sil right iver right iver and shes taken very good care of herself she 
followed all the doctors vocnoise uh sil orders and sil shes very careful what she 
eats and iver vocnoise and theyve met the couple thats gonna adopt the baby sil 
which sil seems kind of odd to me but sil iver vocnoise iver vocnoise iver 
uh right and cutoffththey they were actually able to select the couple from a they 
talked to hesa a lawyer who arranges adoptions sil and she had a file and 
they vocnoise yknow threw kind of a bunch of questions and answers type thing were 
to limit to sil cutoffththree down to three couples and they liked the first couple 
sil they met vocnoise so iver vocnoise iver right iver but uh you know with 
people sil coming back later and saying that vocnoise uh sil they errordidid changed their 
mind and stuff as the adoptive parents id be concerned about that but vocnoise thats 
not gonna happen in this case i dont sil think vocnoise sil and the sil 
because of her age and this makes no sense to me vocnoise the state law 
says that she has to have custody of the child for seventy two hours sil 
before she can give it up for adoption vocnoise uh sil because of her age 
and it sil doesnt make any sense to me but sil vocnoise so the yknow 
theyre sil talking to a social worker now to find out they dont want take 
the baby home sil because theyre afraid of being too attached to it then vocnoise 
and they dont think its a good hesatmosphere for it sil because her mother smokes 
constantly her mothers alcoholic vocnoise um sil they iver noise vocnoise iver no iver sil 
uh so she does not want sil to take the baby home so theyre sil 
arranging some other things sil vocnoise we have actually talked about taking the baby home 
ourselves for that time but we think thats gonna be too hard for us iver 
we even talked about adopting the baby vocnoise but at our age iver thats sil 
i mean wed be seventy years old when the kid graduates from high school vocnoise 
uh and that wouldnt be fair to the kid sil cutoffanand and we were doing 
it for the wrong reasons too so sil we talked about it decided it wasnt 
a good idea iver im not sure im ready to go back through laughallthat iver 
vocnoise as much fun as it was the first time vocnoise sil uh sil i 
just not iver ready willing to do that again iver vocnoise its a great experience 
it really cutoffiit cutoffwawas cutoffiit cutoffwawas sil even when sil yknow we were having problems 
with him and stuff it was great sil uh he couldnt understand vocnoise yknow vocnoise 
my wifes once said told him she says yknow vocnoise something about spending time together 
sil she sil she said that vocnoise sil there is no time that we spend 
with you thats wasted vocnoise and he couldnt understand that vocnoise she said you mean 
this is fun i said i didnt say it was fun laugh laughjujust iver its 
just not laughwasted iver vocnoise and uh sil vocnoise i dont sil think he really 
understood that he might someday but iver yeah vocnoise and i really think both of 
them will be good parents someday vocnoise but she says sil were not ready iver 
vocnoise shes cutoffbebeen iver shes been very mature about it vocnoise sil uh sil vocnoise 
sil and she has sil they are working on an arrangement with the iver uh 
sil couple that are adopting baby will get sil counseling for her iver afterwards too 
and thats one things theyve asked for in the sil adoption agreement sil vocnoise and 
the vocnoise couples sil willing to do that iver oh yeah sil cutoffiit iver vocnoise 
right sil and yknow cutoffththe vocnoise while the babys in the hospital be covered under 
my sons insurance and shes covered under her fathers insurance so vocnoise their medical expenses 
are not gonna be very big iver so iver sil excludename iver mmhmm iver okay

iver mmhmm iver laugh iver umhum vocnoise iver vocnoise iver umhum vocnoise iver sil about 
my brother being in there uh vocnoise being over there and everything yknow he he 
was vocnoise uh sil pretty upset that i did uh that i did that yknow 
that i just went ahead and flunked out of school and uh vocnoise and sil 
and he said unknown yknow vocnoise enlist in something dont go in the damn army 
yknow iver vocnoise so iver yeah he knew it was a bullshit war laugh iver 
vocnoise umhum iver noisenot much noise iver noise iver laughumhum laugh iver umhum iver right 
vocnoise iver vocnoise well sil vocnoise a long time ago uh vocnoise when they had 
cutoffen signed the declaration and everything they said yknow build a fence around your place 
and sil vocnoise and take care of your own yknow and vocnoise i think basically 
thats the way the philosophy should be i think vocnoise theres times when you need 
to be when we need to go help out other people but we try to 
be too much of a policeman now vocnoise sil iver mmhmm sil iver vocnoise you 
get into a vocnoise situation where you really where theres a no win situation from 
the get go and uh vocnoise uh sil i think that vocnoise had we been 
able to sil do what we went over there to do initially vocnoise it wouldve 
worked out okay but we werent so sil so it became a political war as 
everybody knows that knows anything about it vocnoise iver vocnoise iver mmhmm iver vocnoise yeah 
there was a lot of positive things sil uh from it as far as discipline 
as far as uh vocnoise uh vocnoise sil growing up sil faster and everything yknow 
sometimes when i see a girl like my daughter or like other sil other vocnoise 
people at that age yknow and everything i vocnoise yknow they tend to act grown 
up yknow or sil i felt like i was sil forced to grow up yknow 
iver a little bit faster vocnoise uh but vocnoise and then in sil then when 
i get out of service like at twenty two yknow i was kind of like 
behind everybody yknow as far as my age group and stuff sil that didnt have 
to go sil and uh vocnoise so vocnoise i had cutoffhhad sil had a lot 
of uh sil good times as far as that goes and vocnoise yknow cleanliness and 
next to godliness and all that stuff yknow i mean a lot of people dont 
sil vocnoise theres just a lot of lax sil stuff goes on today sil in 
my opinion but vocnoise iver vocnoise iver mmhmm iver mmhmm iver vocnoise well i i 
think that vocnoise my opinion is that if you aint going to school and youre 
not going youre not working and everything you should uh vocnoise be doing something besides 
sil causing problems yknow sil and a lot of kids thats all they really wanna 
do nowadays is just vocnoise cause aggravation to people sil iver vocnoise iver vocnoise the 
lack of discipline at the home vocnoise iver well ive been cutoffththe see i wasnt 
much i cutoffwwas sil my vocnoise being here and my daughter being there i didnt 
really have the uh sil time with her that i wished i wouldve had yknow 
but uh vocnoise uh sil her mother would yknow wouldnt did her all right and 
everything but vocnoise i wished that i wouldve been more involved in her vocnoise growing 
up vocnoise and vocnoise i think two people families are generally better sil yknow for 
vocnoise not necessarily living being cutoffloloved yknow its about being married and everything but iver 
at least being able to be a part of their sil your kids vocnoiselife iver 
vocnoise iver mmhmm iver mmhmm iver vocnoise well i believe its quality not quantity vocnoise 
uh sil ideally vocnoise sil yknow um one parent would be there be it sil 
male or female well yknow man or cutoffwiwife vocnoise man or cutoffwowoman or lady vocnoise 
but uh vocnoise sil but yknow your quality times more important sil yknow vocnoise maybe 
go come home and you vocnoise and all you wanna do is sit down and 
start watching tv or drinking beer or whatever yknow and not spend any time with 
your child it doesnt matter vocnoisewhethwhether youre vocnoise there all day or whether youre there 
for two hours sil vocnoise iver sil well i believe thats way it was originally 
set up you know so vocnoise iver mmhmm iver i personally dont believe that they 
should be allowed to sil vocnoise because i believe they they should have the male 
gender as well as the female gender vocnoise for a proper bringing up vocnoise iver 
balance vocnoiseparent vocnoise iver humum vocnoise iver i dont see any reason for it myself 
but uh sil thats vocnoise interesting uh um vocnoise yknow when they when the first 
when the uh sil vocnoise sil vocnoise when time began yknow according sil my cutofffphilosophy 
vocnoise uh vocnoise sil what i believe in and everything yknow it was vocnoise man 
and woman got married yknow and vocnoise and reason they got married was because of 
procreation yknow keep the vocnoise keep the uh population going vocnoise uh vocnoise i think 
thats the way it was set up originally so vocnoise i have no problem with 
a man being with a man or woman being with a woman but vocnoise um 
sil if vocnoise if that was the relationship vocnoise for everybody iver laughthen uh vocnoise 
then obviously the sil the civilization gonna be dead yknow so vocnoise iver mmhmm iver 
mmhmm sil well ive ive had gay friends and uh vocnoise uh sil one of 
them worked at a t and t and he retired sil and then uh sil 
and the other one was on a disability and everything so uh vocnoise that never 
even came up in their relationship vocnoise nor did it come up in uh a 
cutoffddifferent sil another couple friends that ive had yknow that they uh vocnoise they more 
or less sil took care of each other yknow sil so sil vocnoise iver i 
dont agree with it we had gays in there when i was in there yknow 
so iver yeah i mean you generally sil could vocnoise i mean they didnt broadcast 
it obviously but iver sil yknow they uh sil i mean my personally would i 
would personally wouldnt care yknow as long as uh if i was in a foxhole 
with somebody i could care less whether he is gay or not laugh as long 
as hes shoot a gun yknow to help me out if i was in trouble 
so vocnoise sil iver i think its good and uh sil ive yknow i think 
women are are capable of doing that my only sil disagreement with it is that 
id have a real problem sil being in that foxhole and have a woman beside 
me and sil uh sil shed get shot yknow i dont know how i could 
deal with that itd be vocnoise it sil men i dont know if you you 
sil you sil women have vocnoise yknow different feelings but with about each other than 
they do with men and men have different feelings about each other vocnoise uh than 
they do with women and everything and they tend to be more protective iver sil 
so vocnoise um sil where a man yknow you kind of feel like he can 
carry his own weight yknow a woman you may not sil you may sil feel 
like you have to sil do sil a special thing in order to uh sil 
uh to keep her from getting killed yknow or something or cutoffkkilled just shot or 
something vocnoise so i wouldnt sil personally i dont like that myself sil vocnoise but 
i aint had no problem with them being like a pilot or something like that 
yknow sil iver vocnoise iver sil iver vocnoise i wouldnt like it to be that 
way but uh basically when i was in the service the cutofftaunknown the women uh 
sil had their own sil area of the service that they vocnoise were allowed to 
be basically nurses and stuff yknow iver uh vocnoise noise sil and vocnoise they had 
they you know they went through their own training and everything we didnt vocnoise interface 
with each other or nothing like that you know i mean you might see one 
sil walking vocnoise or marching somewhere but sil as far as fraternizing you werent allowed 
to iver um hum iver um hum iver um iver no not really i mean 
different cultures and everything uh vocnoise but sil i i went to school with blacks 
so i mean that wasnt that big a thing except for the sil influx vocnoise 
of the you know sil i didnt realize how many sil were being drafted or 
being enlisting into the service at the time and everything or how many actually were 
even in the sil in the country you know iver but it didnt bother me 
vocnoise uh sil religions basically everybody when i was in there back in the sixties 
the i mean everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity either catholic or 
something like that but uh sil nowadays you know you have the uh vocnoise uh 
sil more outspoken errorislaislam cutoffmusmuslims muslims and error uh vocnoise islam and uh cutoffjudiajudiasm and 
judaism and everything so vocnoise and there again i dont have a problem with that 
you know because you sil you got to sil meet yourself vocnoise you know you 
got to make your peace with your maker because you know vocnoise if you believe 
in religion youre vocnoise youre here temporarily for an eternity later on you know iver 
um hum iver um hum iver well i hes one thing uh you know being 
uh vocnoise uh vocnoise i came from basically a poor cutoffneighneighborhood errorpoopoor poor uh vocnoise 
uh lifestyle uh early life and everything you know so uh vocnoise um sil if 
anything i guess it kind of made me negative uh sil towards people that sil 
had an influence had money vocnoise and sil didnt do any sil thing good with 
it you know vocnoise im a firm believer that if you got something that you 
should share it with other other people vocnoise i dont always sil practice what i 
preach but sil you know thats sil id be a good philosophy to live by 
vocnoise uh sil vocnoise sil vocnoise and people of other religions and everything um vocnoise 
you know i learned a lot about religion when i cutoffwwas i was raised baptist 
basically but uh sil i vocnoise practice more catholic than anything else now uh sil 
but im sil generally pretty knowledgeable about judaism and muslims and vocnoise everything just because 
i find it sil interesting iver um vocnoise you know was in sixty nines when 
i went in so vocnoise you know you can vocnoise kind of figure that it 
was noise the iver okay vocnoise sil it was kind of uh laugh it was 
different when i because see because when i went in vocnoise uh sil and you 
know well i never had any problem with a black person or or i didnt 
really care you know as long as they uh vocnoise did their job and everything 
im basically the same way today vocnoise uh iver but people coming from other vocnoise 
cities vocnoise like chicago new york yknow and places like that where they were vocnoise 
treated poorly by whites you know they vocnoise um vocnoise they tended to sil act 
differently towards you and everything vocnoise until they realized that you werent like that you 
know sil uh we only had one racial incident when i was in the service 
uh vocnoise where it was sil we were predominantly white vocnoise uh sil platoon vocnoise 
and sil the vocnoise because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so uh 
vocnoise and sil then sil the security cops were errorpapredominantly sil above us and they 
were predominantly black you know vocnoise and i dont know what happened something sil happened 
one time there was only like twenty people in our vocnoise whole uh vocnoise platoon 
it was all in the same barracks vocnoise and uh vocnoise some guy said something 
vocnoise off color to one of them or something like that you know and vocnoise 
got kind of out of hand for a while but vocnoise you know thank god 
nothing cutoffrreally really happened iver um hum iver i think that the iver i think 
society is today of today is less tolerant of uh sil a lot of things 
that they see where getting by with stuff you know vocnoise and theyre more vocal 
about it as opposed to being violent about it back in vocnoise the sixties and 
stuff you know uh sil not here sil but you know down south there were 
people still getting sil hung and stuff you know for being sil a black or 
something and uh vocnoise know there are bad blacks and theres bad whites too you 
know sil so vocnoise but not all of them are vocnoise you know sil are 
that way iver um hum iver but thats what i mean its more you know 
its theyre theyre more vocal about it more uh uh more t v about and 
everything that stuffs been going on for years so sil iver um hum sil iver 
well i think its more sil capable of being violent because of the uh sil 
information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or vocnoise sil 
before you know if somebody got mad at somebody you know you vocnoise might sil 
they might shoot them or something but vocnoise sil not extkill a hundred innocent people 
for no reason iver um hum iver vocnoise sil no i i personally dont because 
uh vocnoise sil yknow ive seen maybe not to the degree of the violence but 
mean i still knew it was violent uh sil stuff when i was kid you 
know that didnt make me a violent person sil so iver sil i think thats 
a cop out myself vocnoise iver um hum iver um hum iver um hum iver 
um hum iver vocnoise i wish i knew the answer uh sil but sil the 
reality you know uh sil i just feel sorry for the the people cutoffw that 
not only feel that they have to do that sil but error and also for 
the people that sil are involved in it on the other those victims and everything 
and their parents and everything vocnoise the only one i really had a vocnoise i 
was really upset with uh was the columbine deal vocnoise sil and that was because 
uh sil vocnoise sil the one kid sil was making bombs and stuff like that 
in the basement and the parents hesknew nothing about or or they did they didnt 
even think anything about and i dont think that behavior sil its uh appropriate for 
a sil sixteen seventeen year old kid sil um iver sil yeah iver vocnoise iver 
um hum iver vocnoise sil and but you know that there and goes back to 
uh vocnoise you know the quality or the quantity i mean if sil obviously this 
sil poor kid you know apparently vocnoise was so miserable in his life that he 
was going down the stairs in basement to vocnoise yknow vocnoise sil to sil figure 
out some way of uh sil reaching his vocnoise sil nirvana or whatever you know 
and uh sil then his parents didnt have a clue sil or if they did 
they didnt care you know iver vocnoise um hum iver um hum iver hum um 
iver vocnoise iver um hum iver hum um iver vocnoise iver cutoffmah cutoffyyknow well vocnoise 
nowadays vocnoise vocnoise unknown i grew up my dad hunted and everything you know so 
we had always had uh sil guns in the house and everything you know but 
uh sil you know i wouldnt sil no more unknown go sil near one unless 
he was around because i uh vocnoise i was told not to you know vocnoise 
uh vocnoise and vocnoise they they always used to say you know if you if 
you stop letting vocnoise sil uh normal people get a gun and the criminals will 
always have a gun well obviously thats not true you know sil uh sil my 
personal belief is that we have the right to bear arms vocnoise uh sil if 
youre of a legal age and everything im not really sure the background checks sil 
really do that great of a job iver um hum iver vocnoise iver vocnoise vocnoise 
how they going to how are they going to judge sil how they going to 
vocnoise uh sil make sure the lock is on a gun i mean sil that 
just seems like a waste of money to me sil all youre doing is cutoffgetgetting 
letting a vocnoise sil a company vocnoise sell a a trigger lock sil for a 
gun sil or and make it make the guy make somebody have to buy one 
vocnoise but youre not going make you put it on the gun so iver vocnoise 
just seems like a waste of sil legislation vocnoise money vocnoise iver um hum iver 
um hum iver um hum iver vocnoise iver vocnoise sil vocnoise well hesthe hesthe sil 
vocnoise sil vocnoise sil definitely this happened to me when i was in the sil 
third grade uh a friend of uh two of our friends were uh sil uh 
sil went home after school we were playing with a gun and everything and one 
uh one of them shot and killed the other one yknow accidentally vocnoise uh sil 
vocnoise sil vocnoise vocnoise it just goes to vocnoise sil vocnoise sil yknow my dad 
always had a gun he hesdidnt didnt have it locked up all the time but 
yknow wasnt necessarily in the same place all the time either yknow i mean so 
vocnoise if you werent really looking for it sil and you know ah you cutoffhaphappen 
to cutoffhappenstanhappenstance sil vocnoise just sil happenstance on to it or something you know uh 
sil uh sil i believe nowadays you know that vocnoise perhaps with the uh with 
the sil the guns unknown you know the availability being more people having guns that 
dont know dont sil shouldnt have them sil apparently vocnoise uh sil you know they 
should be uh sil cutoffloclock under lock and key vocnoise uh sil and as for 
the vocnoise sil you know the parents vocnoise somebodys responsible for you know sil but 
see then you get in to catch twenty two because of the legislation i mean 
you cant require vocnoise sil i dont see how you can require a laugh sil 
uh sil a guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then 
buy a safe for the sil for the gun and and and do all that 
stuff because that vocnoise in the case of a burglar comes into your house sil 
which is why sil vocnoise sil why you have a vocnoise gun anyway you have 
some fear of something like that happening otherwise you shouldnt have one unless youre a 
sportsman vocnoise and uh sil vocnoise then you know youre vocnoise sil its not gonna 
be worth it to have the gun in the first place so iver uh sil 
i do believe that in some the cases sil uh cutoffththe sil the parents or 
the uh sil responsible adult sil should be uh sil found guilty of that iver 
um hum iver um hum iver right iver um laughhum iver vocnoise hesi exti well 
noise thats a vocnoise thats a tough one uh sil i remember when you know 
when we were we had you know sil some movies like that but they were 
like the bowery boys and stuff you know or sil vocnoise it was vocnoise you 
pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but vocnoise and to me 
thats fake sil and uh uh noise and i never really thought about when was 
growing up that it was vocnoise what was real and everything uh i always knew 
that vocnoise by i there again know by my dad being a hunter and everything 
you know i knew that when you shot something that it died it wasnt a 
it wasnt a game you know sil uh vocnoise sil and sil noise sil id 
hate to think that that would vocnoise sil vocnoise sil cause some kid to go 
off his rocker and shoot somebody out errorshishoot shoot another human being i mean that 
doesnt sil noise sil noise sil i dont even know why there should be any 
concern for it guess is what im saying iver sil no cutoffwewe vocnoise we uh 
sil vocnoise sil i generally tried to keep her childhood her childhood yknow sil theres 
a time to grow up and theres time to be a child and and uh 
vocnoise we divorced when she was eight years old so vocnoise i would get up 
every saturday morning and watch cartoons with her and stuff like that yknow sil and 
vocnoise sil tried not to let her watch some of the ones that i sil 
that i didnt like yknow so sil and then on movies and stuff uh sil 
wed let her see some sil shoot them up movies and everything but vocnoise the 
the weirdest movie shes seen uh vocnoise was e t sil i remember that i 
mean sil vocnoise her and her mother went and seen it and everything we were 
vocnoise divorced at the time and uh vocnoise then i went and bought the movie 
vocnoise and iver and brought her over to my house on the weekend and everything 
and vocnoise showed her the movie and vocnoise i said this is e t were 
going to watch vocnoise e t she goes all right you know we was eating 
pizza you know and vocnoise and put it on and then when he extdies vocnoise 
she starts bawling and everything and im going vocnoise well whats the matter and she 
goes vocnoise well hes going to die i said no he aint youve seen the 
movie laugh vocnoise but you know it wasnt sil to her vocnoise the way i 
vocnoise took it was that you know sil it wasnt the same it sil it 
was just wasnt the same movie so iver and in this one he could die 
so iver um hum iver vocnoise iver um laugh iver um hum iver no theres 
a lot of people go to church that arent worth anything too you know so 
i dont really believe that cutoffperperson vocnoise going to church you know uh vocnoise uh 
cutoffr sil makes you a better human being than another human being vocnoise i believe 
that the you know your vocnoise i believe that most people with basic vocnoise uh 
vocnoise structure in their life if its vocnoise based similar to the bible vocnoise or 
you could say buddhism or whatever you know uh vocnoise uh vocnoise that youll tend 
to have a better vocnoiselife than you will if you vocnoise vocnoisepractice vocnoise non vocnoise 
quote unquote religious cutoffwways vocnoise religious ways vocnoise but i dont believe somebody going to 
church makes them a better human being than the next person vocnoise uh vocnoise vocnoisebecausetheres 
a lot of vocnoise hypocrites that go to church vocnoise now these kids i vocnoise 
i think more just more than anything else i mean vocnoise one thing i cutoffrremember 
vocnoise i remember hearing it a lot about too was they cutoffwewere they were picked 
on iver i mean laugh come laughon vocnoise who wasnt picked on you know iver 
i mean just because youre i mean i wasnt really a vocnoise an athletic i 
did cutoffssports play uh sil sports when i was in in high school but i 
cutoffwawas vocnoise damn sure wasnt any good you know unknown like vocnoise other guys but 
vocnoise whether i did or whether i didnt you know i vocnoise i dont vocnoise 
i dont vocnoise nobody picked on me unknown i mean one time i got into 
it errorwhawith vocnoise with one of the uh vocnoise centers in football you know big 
old guy vocnoise and then uh vocnoise and i vocnoisewas still about the same size 
but vocnoise iver oh he said hes going to vocnoise kick my you know what 
and everything i said well be outside you know iver no he vocnoise he didnt 
even come errorbabye i mean he came out but vocnoise its like he went the 
other way i thought well you know he vocnoise you take it if hed vocnoise 
get a big kick out of kicking my skinny little butt you know then iver 
but you know vocnoise and years ago it was kind of funny wed seen him 
uh seen each other and everything and uh vocnoise and vocnoise at the vocnoise someplace 
around and he sit there and went vocnoise hey remember that time i said yeah 
yeah yeah iver he says i didnt iver he said i didnt think youd stand 
up to me i said well you know what the heck vocnoise you know iver 
unknown only thing you could do is vocnoise beat my rear end you know so 
iver i think theres a heck of a lot more to it then what well 
probably ever know um vocnoise you know cutoffthothose they really havent checked into the background 
of the parents you know theyre still cutoffb vocnoise what their beliefs were and everything 
vocnoise uh vocnoise and i think thats a shame because you know you mentioned it 
vocnoisebefore about vocnoise something accidentally errorhappingeninghappening vocnoise where uh vocnoise some kid shoots another kid 
you know and then the parents are vocnoise are responsible vocnoisefor it and everything you 
know these two kids vocnoisedeliberately went in vocnoise to kill vocnoise and they wanted to 
kill more than what they killed vocnoise uh vocnoise then they killed extthemselves so well 
never know vocnoisefrom their endpoint why they did it vocnoise but vocnoise i think theres 
got to be something vocnoise that we could vocnoisefind out vocnoisefrom you know uh vocnoise 
from their parents as to how they lived you know they could have been vocnoise 
anything you know vocnoise they could have been down there they could have been vocnoise 
making him making him do it you know iver uh uh vocnoise iver i just 
think its a different time now i dont think i think everybodys vocnoise living more 
vocnoisefor today vocnoise and talking about the future you know vocnoise hoping that the futures 
extthere vocnoise i think theres a vocnoise quote unquote uh sil in time aspect to 
life you know iver everybodys living longer everybodys uh theres more medical things where people 
get uh vocnoise can cutoffgget be healed vocnoisefrom things that they couldnt be healed vocnoisefrom 
uh vocnoise so everybody today is living vocnoise uh sil basically as today as their 
vocnoisefuture where back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know 
i mean vocnoise i wasnt really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about 
vocnoise tomorrow iver noise getting married having kids you know and having a vocnoise nice 
place to live iver noise um hum iver yeah and then you know then sil 
ill show that son of a gun you know ill vocnoise ill shoot him you 
know vocnoise uh sil like you know the guys that were vocnoisesupposedly picking on him 
i dont even know whether they even shot him then but vocnoise um vocnoise but 
yeah i think they kind of just thought you know cutoffiill vocnoise sil ill vocnoise 
you know ill vocnoise ill vocnoiseprove to them that noise you know they cant push 
me around iver and errorunfortunanleyunfortunately uh they didnt really vocnoiseprove anything except for that they 
that vocnoise death is vocnoisefinal laugh iver um hum iver she graduated last year vocnoise 
so uh noise but vocnoise she went to vocnoise she went cutoffhohome she was on 
home study noise so noise cutoffshshe iver um hum iver um hum iver no she 
did uh she cutoffd vocnoise my ex wife did uh vocnoise i wouldve vocnoisepreferred her 
unknown to get continue going to school but vocnoise she had some problems with some 
students and stuff noiseand noise iver um iver right vocnoise she just went there last 
year iver vocnoisehumum she had a uh sil she vocnoisewas taught a cutofftututor by a 
tutor vocnoise noise from vocnoise she vocnoisewas from kirkisville thats vocnoisebefore she graduated sil which 
is a suburb of saint louis vocnoise iver um um iver vocnoise um generally its 
in the summertime uh vocnoise thats the way it was when she was going to 
school vocnoise uh sil now you know with her going to school at like at 
like at uh saint louis vocnoise um noise i guess it would be that way 
iver but we really ever cutoffhahavnt vocnoise really havent talked about that but my ex 
wifes got family here vocnoise so uh vocnoise you know she comes in about two 
or three vocnoise weeks at least out of a summer iver and i tend to 
see her then iver um hum iver oh yeah vocnoise i uh vocnoise i think 
she really kind of knows that from conversations uh with me and vocnoisestuff while she 
was growing noiseup noise uh vocnoise you know mine uh my values and stuff vocnoise 
basically are uh more religious oriented vocnoise you know vocnoise uh vocnoise than i would 
say sil my wifes vocnoise but uh vocnoise uh vocnoise so i think she kinda 
she knows vocnoise what i value as being important what i value as vocnoise being 
not important and sil vocnoise but noise on it the rest of the question cutoffih 
id vocnoise id love to have been able to have uh vocnoise uh been cutoffyknoyknow

having joint custody vocnoise but then vocnoise our divorce was vocnoise somewhat bitter vocnoise or 
became even more bitter and everything you know vocnoise um vocnoise so vocnoise that tended 
not to vocnoise not to happen vocnoise and then she ended up getting transferred to

tell noisepeople they can go there vocnoise its the v v a vietnam veterans association 
some people dont even know about it you know iver vocnoise a lot of them 
they dont want any better they wont want anything different thats all they want iver 
i think that basically thats in a nut shell theyve reached a point in their 
life where vocnoise you know that theyre cowards as far as going out and killing 
themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death or sil 
um sil smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh cutoffp crack or whatever and 
uh vocnoise then just living sil in a hell i mean iver basically because you 
know sil the open shelter i dont know whether you ever been around there but 
it sil it isnt a pretty sight you know iver id say of uh vocnoise 
vocnoise sil i think they the the v v a in generally sees on the 
average sil five seven ten something like that a day vocnoise and not all of 
them homeless iver and not all of them are sil are vietnam vets either you 
know iver uh vocnoise noise but you know they tend to say id say of 
those theres about three vocnoise three to four of them that are vietnam veterans vocnoise 
uh a day sil and they tend to sil come back i mean i cutoffsstarted 
vocnoise originally started going in there just drinking coffee you know to kill time and 
everything you know sil and uh vocnoise sil now i kinda know everybody you know 
and vocnoise somebodyll walk in and ill say hey hows it going you know vocnoise 
and theyll talk vocnoise cutoffththen then theres sil i theres another thing to cutoffaabout cutoffaabout 
sil about vocnoise a lot of the uh sil people back uh vietnam cutoffevereverything and 
everything that the sil theyll tend to talk to maybe you or talk to somebody

vocnoise sil satisfaction for what ails them you know that side of a vocnoise you

thing you know well you lied to me once you lied to me vocnoise four

that thats a as a as a sil as a sil yknow sil as a 
secondary agenda iver their sil their main purpose is vocnoise is that yknow iver laugh

iver im comfortable iver im from columbus ohio i was born and raised in columbus 
uh vocnoise i grew up on the east side of columbus exti vocnoise graduated from 
excludename high school vocnoise i sil then sil started working for ohio state in nineteen 
seventy seven and have been there here for twenty four years iver um my family 
personally my parents uh vocnoise my parents vocnoise my father was born and raised in 
daytona beach my mother was born and raised in uh vocnoise portsmouth ohio both of 
them are ohio state graduates my father was a c p a vocnoise my mother 
was a school teacher but didnt work vocnoise at vocnoise when we were kids vocnoise 
actually they met at lazarus working vocnoise at lazarus vocnoise yeah they both vocnoise were 
different vocnoise yknow he was in vocnoise oh yep vocnoise they both worked during college 
vocnoise i guess my dad was on the vocnoise g i bill after the war 
so thats how he got in here vocnoise had to work some part time work 
to sil get his degree sil umhum vocnoise its just east broad street just franklin 
park conservatory iver um no actually now i live in hilliard iver and i have 
a wife vocnoise been married thirteen years have two kids age five and seven vocnoise 
both of them ones in second grade and the other ones sil still in daycare 
at ohio state university iver umhum mobile laugh laughyeah vocnoise it is its a lot 
of work it really is vocnoise shes a a nurse and she works at the 
excludename medical center vocnoise in the breast cancer department sil shes a sil o r 
nurse sil shes worked here for twenty two years also got her degree at ohio 
state sil she grew up in dayton and then moved here to go to college 
and vocnoise then stayed uh at ohio state after college iver we met at ohio 
state vocnoise um yeah everything revolves around ohio state huh vocnoise i worked when i 
first started working here i was working as an vocnoise orderly in the operating room 
for ten years and she worked in the intensive care unit so vocnoise only been 
in the maintenance area for maybe ten vocnoise years also vocnoise um i dont know 
it just vocnoise i dont know it didnt seem like it was heading anywhere and 
i wanted to start doing something that was more career oriented now i do vocnoise 
h a h v a c for vocnoise twenty two buildings in the northeast area 
vocnoise do a lot of vocnoise chillers and vocnoise laser labs and chill water for 
uh sil different kinds of experiments theyre doing in the chemistry departments and stuff like 
that so sil went to school vocnoise through our sil technical school vocnoise for it 
to get a degree in the vocnoise uh h v a c stuff vocnoise oh 
yeah i like its everyday is different you have different problems everyday yknow and vocnoise 
i like vocnoise working with tools and fixing stuff so vocnoise thats uh come in 
handy but iver yeah from the laughstrike yeah laughyeah vocnoise um actually a lot of 
our stuff did pretty well while we were off so didnt make you feel as 
needed as you wanted to be maybe sil yknow vocnoise yeah yknow vocnoise we got 
a lot of our buildings up and running before they went vocnoise on strike and 
i think vocnoise the bosses vocnoise knew this was coming so sil a lot of 
the air conditioning was already running by then iver right yeah the middle of may 
is when they usually start most of this stuff vocnoise heating cooling and ventilation vocnoise 
uhhum iver um all of them the university is divided up in different areas vocnoise 
and theres a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs 
for those areas usually vocnoise there are about twenty buildings or so ours is vocnoise 
in the northeast area vocnoise from wexner down through the oval to vocnoise oh i 
dont know about vocnoise uh derby or so around in there and then on over 
to woodruff iver nope vocnoise not my cutoffararea vocnoise not my area if its hot 
in here laugh iver you better call the north shop vocnoise umhum iver because yeah 
iver yeah iver well thats probably the roof right there so iver there was snow 
or something iver ill bet vocnoise yep iver hm iver control problems vocnoise of course 
theres always a leak somewhere vocnoise yeah vocnoise well it could be hot water they 
vocnoise send out heat and hot water to all the different buildings from the power 
plant vocnoise but about now they drain that vocnoise its drained for the summer to 
give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so vocnoise they might have 
drained it and thats why it quit vocnoise hm yeah vocnoise laughthen run quick laugh 
vocnoise put plastic up vocnoise oh i dont know it seemed like vocnoise its a 
tough call because its very unusual situation here at ohio state where they have a 
union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions 
you think of autoworkers you think of pipefitters you think of you dont think of 
such a wide variety of people vocnoise and thats very hard to negotiate for anybody 
yknow when youre talking raises and lots of money like this which what they were 
going for vocnoise and the majority of the people in the skilled trades vocnoise arent 
real big participaters in the union yknow we just ride along and from what ive 
seen over the twenty years ive been here vocnoise is it seemed that vocnoise a 
lot of the union vocnoise what they did was was keep vocnoise the trouble maker 
employees around longer yknow vocnoise and vocnoise so weve really never had a lot of 
use for the union but vocnoise recently we just figured out that you laughknow vocnoise 
if they decide to strike we have no choice too and vocnoise you cant work 
because they will take all the money you make vocnoise crossing that lines so vocnoise 
you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that 
they made theyll take them to court vocnoise and theyll vocnoise yeah vocnoise its against 
vocnoise yeah its against the union contracts so vocnoise you have just iver no no 
they take no they take the money whether youre in it or not you have 
no choice you have a choice as to whether youre a member or not but 
they still take the money vocnoise and if you cross the line theyll take that 
money back vocnoise so anybody that vocnoise yeah yknow youre better off getting another job 
if it lasts for a long time vocnoise i did some of that laughinterviewing vocnoise 
its tough to yknow columbus has a big vocnoise yknow vocnoise job market theres everywhere 
you look theres help wanted so but its tough to get a job where you 
can just walk in and start today or yknow tell him hey yknow the minute 
strike is over im gone and vocnoise so that was kind of tough looking for 
that type of job so vocnoise oh yeah three weeks of pay its cost yeah 
cost quite a bit of money but vocnoise if you got some sil strike pay 
and this and that but it wasnt a lot yknow two hundred dollars a week 
isnt much at all so vocnoise and when you have a laughfamily and vocnoise i 
mean two hundred dollars a week dont pay my day care bill so vocnoise so 
its gonna be tight for our family for vocnoise a few months yknow to get 
back on iver no iver no vocnoise i mean vocnoise the money vocnoise yknow the 
money is great yknow fine its the biggest raise theyve ever given anybody here at 
the university vocnoise and vocnoise actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they 
went out on strike vocnoise was a better deal than what theyve really settled for 
now as far as because the signing bonus was more and vocnoise the big stipulation 
was the fact that these people didnt wanna be separated from the hospital vocnoise they 
dont think its fair yknow that vocnoise you start down at the hospital as a 
janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus 
you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and vocnoise then they did 
the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on main 
campus and stuff so vocnoise thats kind of a sticky situation because theyve always kept 
the university vocnoise and the hospital separate budget vocnoise they are definitely a separate budget 
and you know the u vocnoise hospital i can see where theyre coming from everybody 
in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and 
that vocnoise and theyre vocnoise thirty five million in the hole because they bought o 
s u east and all this but vocnoise yknow its not the unions fault that 
they vocnoise ran out the contract yknow and yknow so vocnoise and what we find 
in our area mainly is vocnoise that vocnoise people vocnoise the vocnoise entrance wage is 
so low that vocnoise its hard to find anybody that has any skills to come 
in and do the jobs thats yknow and they want this place to be the 
top ten in the nation or whatever as far as but theyre not willing to 
pay a lot of these people and vocnoise yknow they think contracting is the way 
but youre always gonna have to have people here to because vocnoise contractors just dont 
drop what theyre doing and show up today vocnoise and a lot of times we 
have a job finished before theyve written up the work order vocnoise yknow were right 
there within moments if theres a flood or yknow something like that you call the 
cutoffcontracontract ill be in thursday yknow if your air condition so vocnoise theyre always gonna 
have to have people here so i just feel sil theyre either better to downscale 
the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people vocnoise than have twenty 
people that half of them know whats going on half of them dont so but 
thats tough to do when youre starting sil people at eight dollars an hour and 
stuff so vocnoise theres yknow wendys laughmcdonalds theres places that you can make that money 
so vocnoise umhum vocnoise my vocnoise yknow vocnoise to me the thing that hurt me 
the most out of it is vocnoise they wanna put caps vocnoise on our salaries 
vocnoise so im at the highest scale i can go vocnoise right now as far 
as job title vocnoise i theres no other job i can move to until unless 
i move in to sil supervision or some up in the vocnoise and ill be 
out of the union if i do that anyways so vocnoise but theyre gonna put 
a cap on that sil where you can only make so much money sil at 
a point which im almost there right now im only like fifty cents away from 
that cap vocnoise and if thats the case sil if i retire in six years 
vocnoise sil ill be capped out right now so then in other words im wanna 
retire in six years if i dont change jobs vocnoise making exactly what i make 
now which that was my worst fear of it all but vocnoise that wasnt even 
on the laughnegotiating table they were still worried about this two dollars and get this 
cutoffhosphospital yeah vocnoise thats what they were fighting for was the low end and didnt 
vocnoise try to get the hospital and the uh sil main campus the same iver 
vocnoise um yeah theres sil yknow our shop only has about five people out of 
twenty maybe that have been here over ten years probably vocnoise sil lot of turnover 
sil a lot of vocnoise people go on to management positions and vocnoise or vocnoise 
leave or vocnoise but once youve got laughtwentyyears and its like you vocnoise you cant 
leave now vocnoise yknow im like iver locked in now so vocnoise yknow ill be 
forty eight when i retire from here and ill be able to go out sil 
in the workplace and vocnoise feel like ive gotten good education and work skills from 
working here for this long and vocnoise yknow theyve definitely paid for classes for me 
so i dont know what theyre big vocnoise gripe is for education when theyre striking 
and all this because vocnoise ive never had a problem if you wanna take a 
class we get classes sil we can take anything we want so iver vocnoise sil 
its available its just whether they go and sil put forth the effort so iver 
vocnoise iver sure iver yeah vocnoise you can take yeah i mean vocnoise iver people 
graduate get degrees from ohio state vocnoise working here vocnoise taking one course a cutoffququarter 
sil one course a quarter sil and get a degree in history or whatever it 
might take them sil to cutofffunknown ten years or something yknow but vocnoise its like 
why not sil its free iver yeah why not take advantage of this vocnoise yeah 
vocnoise why not take advantage of that so sil vocnoise iver vocnoise um i dont 
know yknow iver ive sil keep thinking about that all time but it vocnoise im 
like i want something where i can be off during the summer vocnoise so i 
can take my kids and we can go out west or yknow sil have because 
my wifes in the same boat shell retire two years after i do and our 
kids yknow will be young vocnoise i five year old and i only have six 
years to go so were talking eleven years old iver vocnoise yeah sil vocnoise laughyeah 
then they wont wanna go anywhere with you laughanyways so vocnoise its laughprobably a pipe 
laughdream laugh iver vocnoise now is when i need to be laughoff with them yknow 
where we can vocnoise take them out and run iver yeah iver uh weve been 
very happy with the o s u daycare i dont know if you have any 
association with but oh its sil its just unbelievable vocnoise our daughter went there her 
from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade vocnoise 
and uh vocnoise i mean when she got out of that daycare she could read 
she could write she could do computer yknow sil yknow sil its an education its 
not vocnoise yknow people you pay for its vocnoise sil one of your highers but 
vocnoise yknow higher amount of money for vocnoise iver yeah being a nurse the wife 
that helps a lot because thats what that thing was really functioning around was nurses 
getting them some good daycare because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so 
vocnoise thats how it first started before it you wasnt even on campus it was 
over on vocnoise like fourth or summit in a church when it first started vocnoise 
but sil yknow sil its just not vocnoise sil yknow people are always saying i 
cant believe how much you pay for daycare vocnoise and im like but look what 
were getting yknow vocnoise sil people take their kids to vocnoise somebodys neighbors house and 
sil the lady can be sitting them in front of the tv and iver and 
nothing happens yknow vocnoise over here vocnoise yeah vocnoise iver over here you have students 
sil that coming in and work as work studies and this and that and theyre 
in vocnoise the education field or this theyre gung ho theyre ready to go a 
quarter changes and a whole group new pumped in yknow vocnoise and most of the 
teachers there are vocnoise mothers themselves and yknow they have computers in the room theyve 
learning yknow vocnoise its really yknow weve sil sending both of them to kindergarten at 
o s u too vocnoise they offer a kindergarten program there mainly because its all 
day vocnoise where in the hilliard school system and theirs is a half a day 
so we feel vocnoise were better off leaving them there iver than sil bussing them 
to a half a day kindergarten then bussing them to a daycare thats near their 
school so we might as well do all day plenty of time vocnoise they get 
a nap vocnoise they yknow they get fed and all that so vocnoise been really 
happy with the daycare there sil iver mmhmm sil where from iver oh my iver 
vocnoise wow iver oh thats it vocnoise iver mmhmm iver yeah sil iver theres not 
a lot around yknow vocnoise and we were on the list forever we were on 
the list five years before we had our cutoffffirst sil first kid laughso laugh laughyeah 
they called vocnoise well are you still wanna be on the list yeah we dont 
have any children but keep us on the laughlist yknow vocnoise and its like you 
said its a and theres three or four hundred kids in that daycare its a 
large daycare vocnoise sil but sil theres vocnoise not a lot out there thats good 
quality yknow i mean youll its scary and then you see it in the news 
and vocnoise then vocnoiseuh they were vocnoise abusing the kids or you know and you 
dont wanna go to work feeling sil that youre worrying about your kids and weve 
never really felt like that vocnoise and vocnoise we kind of work a little different 
shifts my wife and i so vocnoise our kids are only actually there about five 
hours a day because she doesnt start until nine thirty and i sil pick them 
up at four so vocnoise iver yeah i start early and she starts late so 
she gets vocnoisethem the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then 
vocnoise then she can take the boy over to sil the daycare and then theyre 
only there five hours or so vocnoise iver their daycare vocnoise oh i dont know 
its tough i think cutoffffor sil really i believe more in that sil large corporations 
vocnoise need to sil have some kind of daycare offered its just theres not that 
many people anymore that can afford vocnoise to have a one income family i mean 
yknow we could do it yknow but vocnoise yknow we wouldnt live as nice as 
we do we wouldnt have as nice of cars as we do yknow wed struggle 
a little more so vocnoise so its a toss up its a real iver yknow 
its a real worried and you really have to think about it sil when you 
start getting there because vocnoise it was tough dropping them off when they were six 
weeks old and youre going oh geezy are we doing the right thing yknow vocnoise 
but vocnoise yknow some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they 
learn and come home with we sil sit down and talk about it and were 
just like i dont think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff yknow 
vocnoise and you know sil kept them entertained all day long by ourselves yknow vocnoise 
theres no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids yknow vocnoise 
theyre all in daycare laugh they yknow vocnoise yknow they just arent around anymore its 
not the same anymore where vocnoise yknow every other house had some kids and mom 
was home and stuff so vocnoise yknow theyve made a lot of friends through there 
and they still vocnoise the daughter is in a different school still associates with friends 
vocnoise that are in other school systems vocnoise that she met at the daycare so 
sil iver and they dont know any different sil iver yknow they dont understand the 
concept so sil they dont know any different of vocnoise yknow why didnt we get 
to stay home they may later when they grow older but sil yeah but i 
still think sil yknow they benefited a lot from it now iver sil the ultimate 
would probably be vocnoise a part time thing yknow if sil but neither one of 
our positions offer any type of part time work vocnoise we have some friends that 
do that where they only go two days a week or something which is sil 
they get a little bit sil of both the worlds so sil iver mmhmm you 
can do part time you can do three or two day a week iver umhum 
iver umhum sil umhum iver yeah oh yeah vocnoise iver umhum iver yeah iver umhum 
sil its a job sil its a full time laughjob laughi laughmean vocnoise laugh vocnoise 
my wife and i are both like oh vocnoise i cant wait to get laughback 
laughto work iver vocnoise laughworks laughgotta be easier than this laugh vocnoise yknow iver because 
now theyre getting to the age where theyre fighting more and yknow and you got 
a boy and a girl and yknow vocnoise its iver yknow always something going on 
iver so iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise cutoffththats thats sil one of the things we looked 
when we were sil shopping for homes was we were shopping for schools systems just 
as much yknow so sil vocnoise and i dont want to buy a house and 
i dont want to have to move when my kids get older to move into 
a better school system so vocnoise because it seems like since weve bought our house 
the houses are just sil doubling and tripling in value its cutoffunbelieveunbelievable vocnoise sil yeah 
sil oh i dont know ours is increased quite a lot since weve been there 
but vocnoise sil weve been there i guess vocnoise about ten years sil vocnoise sil 
um sil we live rented in grandview iver sil before we got sil this was 
our first house iver grandview has its own school system too sil but iver yeah 
sil oh no laugh thats one you stay away from laugh yeah iver yeah vocnoise 
sil we did a lot of searching when we bought our house sil yeah vocnoise 
its hard to find what you want in a house sil and get the school 
system too vocnoise you get in to arlington you get in to vocnoise grandview places 
like this or bexley vocnoise sil and the price range we were in vocnoise sil 
you were gonna have to dump fifty thousand in to the houses just to sil 
get them up sil yknow we had a list of what we wanted in a 
house and vocnoise sil our house was only sil seventeen years old when we bought 
it but it had everything we wanted vocnoise sil fireplace full dry basement yknow two 
and a half car garage yknow vocnoise sil all the stuff that we wanted when 
a lot of the older houses sil wet basements garage burned down or yknow vocnoise 
sil the lots were packed sil vocnoise sil so we live on a golf course 
and have a creek in the back yard and so its really vocnoise sil yeah 
they dont yeah they play in the creek they dont play golf yet laugh iver 
the cutoffololdest the daughters are already taking golf lessons iver vocnoise yeah iver so i

than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and look in your house 
sil the neighbors right behind you youre staring at them sitting on their deck vocnoise 
sil we got all woods and a creek and then the golf course so sil 
so thats hard to find sil in the city limits because were inside two seventy 
still so iver yep iver they put them so close these huge homes and then 
theres ten feet between them and everybody sits in their little backyard with their fence 
around it and looks at each other vocnoise yeah yeah yeah i was just theres 
nothing and i was we looked at some of those and my wifes like theres 
no way were buying the yknow you feel like youre in florida or something vocnoise 
iver sil yeah iver heseh yeah sil where the trees were mature and they didnt 
really ruin our development and cut down a lot of the large trees sil vocnoise 
sil so iver yeah iver vocnoise for columbus iver um vocnoise living here all my 
life sil i dont like it yknow vocnoise sil i like the old cow town 
laughyknow they can call it what they want i dont cutoffgeget it was easy to 
get around youd never had any traffic you dont vocnoise sit on the freeway like 
you do now now its like you dont wanna go out at four o clock 
or yknow you just dont wanna get involved in it vocnoise sil so i dont 
know growth is good but i guess im not into as much as theyre vocnoise 
sil a lot of other people vocnoise its good for the economy but sil its 
just amazing all the sil every time you turn around theyre plopping vocnoise two four 
hundred sil home unit sil yknow developments up here and im just thinking vocnoise sil 
where are these people all coming from yknow you do sil just cant imagine vocnoise 
sil whered these people all move from laughyknow vocnoise this is getting scary vocnoise sil 
yeah whats the big draw yknow vocnoise and you know you still see yknow when 
they opened up a lone star steak near our house they couldnt even do lunch 
because they didnt have the people sil vocnoise sil right so you know that its 
sil the people are just dying for people to work out there iver yeah sil 
so iver yeah sil i not some of them just look like yknow cracker back 
sil box houses that yknow they put up in a week or cutoffsomesomething its vocnoise 
sil amazing how you can drive by and then in two weeks drive by and 
theres fifty homes vocnoise sil because theres a lot of growth in hilliard hilliards thats 
starting to scare us actually a little bit because vocnoise sil now they just built 
another whole high school so sil vocnoise two whole high schools i think sil they 
were up to two or vocnoise sil three thousand senior graduates last year iver yeah 
sil yeah thats the worst part there are a lot sil they could really sil 
double sil they took sil our neighbor is in the sixth grade and vocnoise sil 
they took a whole elementary school last year and turned it into sixth grade sil 
iver sil just one school vocnoise sil so vocnoise thats how many of those there 
was iver um i dont know sil i think theyre enjoying and i dont know 
yknow iver but its sil mindboggling that its because i came from a small community 
there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and 
now youre talking two whole high schools two football teams yknow vocnoise sil its just 
mindboggling all these people you know you graduate with vocnoise sil you know know of 
hand full of people and dont know anybody else vocnoise sil its like sil yknow 
a lot more of a tight knit group sil vocnoise as a child so vocnoise 
sil we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it iver 
yeah oh yeah sil yknow people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so 
sil its kind of like the small town sil thing vocnoise which would have goods 
and bads but vocnoise sil i dont know sil sil vocnoise yeah my parents still 
live there and vocnoise sil i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated 
with its still live in town and vocnoise sil yknow they just had a twenty 
year reunion here a couple years ago and vocnoise sil a lot of participation in 
that sil and so iver sil vocnoise oh i dont know just seemed easier yknow 
life was laughyknowidontknow vocnoise sil it just wasnt the the drivings the main issue with 
cutoffmomost me yknow the freeways we have here werent built for the amount of people 
that travel on them now i remember when they built seventy one north vocnoise i 
remember when they built seventy east yknow there were vocnoise no freeways yknow and sil 
yeah i remember going up three fifteen when they first opened it and it was 
like no body was on it sil you could just drive on it and it 
was like an empty road vocnoise that no body knew about yet and now its 
like a parking lot everyday so vocnoise sil ya its just a lot of different 
stuff about it yknow that and vocnoise sil i dont know sil vocnoise sil it 
seems like sil yknow sil activities to go do things everythings more crowded its yknow 
my wife thinks this citys the eat out city sil yknow everybody vocnoise sil if 
you go anywhere at six thirty vocnoise sil everybody and their brother is eating noise 
out all the time it seems like constantly we live near a vocnoise sil uh 
sil we live near mill run which is an area vocnoise sil theyve just built 
up in the last few years that just has sil like twenty restaurants in it 
that sil you drive by any of those at sil five six o clock vocnoise 
sil every lots full to the brim i dont care if its tuesday thursday yknow 
sil sil so iver yeah or yeah or yknow vocnoise its tough when you know 
youve got kids that vocnoise are doing softball soccer yknow vocnoise sil all these events 
and vocnoise sil yknow like on thursdays when the daughter plays softball my wife leaves 
the house at eight thirty and she usually vocnoise sil drives from work to the 
softball and after that she sil home by nine sil so shes like i can 
see how you fall into this drive through window business sil yknow vocnoise sil no 
but luckily yknow vocnoise sil i pick the kids up so that helps a lot 
i can get them home we can find feed them and i can get them 
so thats how our life is sil vocnoise sil mister mom iver oh you have 
to nowadays yknow i dont understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife vocnoise 
sil still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that 
just doesnt happen now now yknow if your wife didnt work you could expect these 
things but vocnoise shes doing forty hours a week too so sil it is its 
work and its a full time job vocnoise sil they start shoot the seven year 
old just brought here it is the end of the year vocnoise sil second grade 
she brings home this project vocnoise sil gonna have to have a book report use 
three books of reference yknow shes never done anything like this it was the battle 
all weekend long yknow getting this vocnoise sil information out of her yknow she had 
to pick an animal and do a whole sil report on it she gonna have 
to stand up in front of the class and vocnoise sil make a box with 
a display in it and i was just like this is second grade this seems 
more like yknow vocnoise sixth there seems so much more advanced than when we were 
kids yknow vocnoise sil i cant believe in second grade we were already writing cursive 
already sil thats all she writes in now vocnoise sil i mean it seemed like 
they were teaching it then maybe might be learning some of it sil sil yeah 
sil shes in fractions shes doing fractions shes doing percentages already in second grade vocnoise 
sil and i thought we were one plus one two laugh vocnoise you know in 
second grade it just seems like theyre three years ahead vocnoise so iver i always 
wished somebody would redo a survey on that and say yknow back in sixty five 
or whatever vocnoise whats the difference between what theyre teaching them then and what they 
teach them now vocnoise is it really that or is it just our imagination just 
dont remember enough yeah vocnoise it seems more to me and computers really have helped 
it iver because sil yknow vocnoise the son at five already plays all these adding 
games and subtraction extgames and letter games and vocnoise yknow at least the day care 
all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff its not game 
game its vocnoise it has a game theme to it but noise sil youre gonna 
have to do something to get to the sil game play or whatever iver oh 
yeah sil you cant get them off laugh iver laughits laughlike vocnoise laughwe dont have 
one at home because were worried of laughthat iver laughtheyre laughlike vocnoise afraid were gonna 
get them addicted to the internet or so yknow vocnoise because vocnoise the nintendo and 
those type of things are bad enough theyre good baby sitter but you need to 
limit it iver um i sil vocnoise it i think it depends on the child 
and i think it depends on vocnoise the adult as far as the supervision of 
it sil yknow were very strict as far as sil what games they have sil 
no yknow vocnoise its so wild yknow when we were kids vocnoise cowboy and indians 
everybody had guns everybody yknow if you had the best death act you were the 
best yknow cutoffclippingand vocnoise and nowadays oh ho vocnoise dont let him have a extgun 
yknow dont let him play with a yknow even a squirt gun yknow and so 
vocnoise you wonder vocnoise whether its overexaggerated or sil yknow none of us grew up 
sil shooting people or this yknow we dont own a fire arm but we played 
with guns and played cow all these games and vocnoise so i just wonder vocnoise 
whether this is really sil yknow but societys a lot different now iver yeah iver 
yeah iver and we monitor what they watch sil television wise vocnoise we do a 
lot of library things get them to the library a couple days a week try 
to keep them interested in books and vocnoise iver and iver yeah we got actually 
we use the grandview library they have a really good library there and a vocnoise 
large selection of videos and they have vocnoise story time things where they read to 
the kids and get them interested in books and yknow sil different type of things 
where you can vocnoise win things for reading amount of books iver umhum iver umhum 
iver yeah its great you know and they like it they sing a song they 
yknow vocnoise interact with other kids and sil learn to use the library yknow nowadays 
yknow vocnoise people dont go to the library as much either on they you get 
your information off the internet or vocnoise you buy a books or yknow sil yeah 
sil yknow so vocnoise i just weve felt that if we sil cutoffclippingintroduce sil introduce 
them now that vocnoise hopefully this will lead on to later in vocnoise with this 
way you can monitor their television we let them sil rent a couple movies here 
and there vocnoise but we see what they rent or yknow take out compared to 
yknow the cartoon network and all these crazy its just vocnoise cartoons just seem so 
worthless nowadays but vocnoise actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched 
vocnoise and they seem more violent than some of the new ones vocnoise yknow daffy 
duck and the road runner and these type of things all it was was kill 
the fox yknow they have that a vocnoise so were just like wow wait well 
i dont know if we wanna want let them watch that either so vocnoise yeah 
they cutoffclippingreally and disney and disneys pretty strong i mean yknow you think of disney 
and you think of kids vocnoise but you still vocnoise a lot of the stuff 
they put out is pretty hardcore for a five year old or so i mean 
yknow a lot of the sil dinosaurs and all kinds of stuff its its of 
violent nature vocnoise but sil you gotta sil if you balance it i think youll 
be all right vocnoise oh yeah absolutely yeah sil its tough sometimes laugh laughyeah to 
read the paper at the laughsame laughtime yeah vocnoise yeah sil like this five year 
olds addicted to the tarzan he likes tarzan movie that was out so vocnoise yeah 
he wants to laugh weve noise kind of boycotted him laugh vocnoise the daughter laughwants 
to throw it away laugh vocnoise never vocnoise dont have to watch that again iver

my five year old can name all hundred and fifty pokemon characters but couldnt tell 
ya his phone number vocnoise and and thats true with mine iver he cutoffclippingknows yeah

cutoffclippingboggling yeah it is thats what it is vocnoise of all the pokemon vocnoise and 
im just like i dont know where it leads yknow like is it any worse 
than baseball cards or you know iver probably not its a fad theyre gonna sil 
move along and move out of it yknow vocnoise so iver yeah iver thats what 
you better hope iver oh yeah vocnoise and you know theyre like three fifty for 
a pack of cards you dont even get gum like we used to laughwith the 
baseball cards yknow vocnoise yeah you get three you know out of five six cards 
for three fifty yknow and youre like geezy cow and every time you go the 
store they got them all on the check out lane vocnoise lets get the cards 
vocnoise now theyve done the first hundred and fifty theyre moving on to series two 
yknow and vocnoise never oh they are theyre killing on it they really are iver 
yep iver that yep we went to a thing there they were talking about that 
that vocnoise you gotta figure out what the bainby baby boomers vocnoise are moving into 
and invest into those type of things yknow iver those are the mass people vocnoise 
you gotta find out and figure out what needs theyre gonna roll into like when 
they get older yknow vocnoise you get into the wheel laughchaircompaniesorsomethingyknow vocnoise somewhere its just 
gonna be massive iver because you know iver yeah sil the crew theyve gone to

vocnoise i remember our car had an a m radio in it and that was 
it yknow sil yeah sil yeah sil yeah sil on an album sil yknow now 
the kids are like i want the c d put the c d in sil 
yeah yeah iver yep ive heard that too sil i just differ sil its different 
and yknow i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were

some other people that are oh you havent seen anything yet wait until they just 
dont even want to be in sight with you and dont wait till they yknow 
vocnoise im not going on a vacation with you i couldnt spend a week there 
with you sil so sil you hope that doesnt happen but sil ive heard friends 
say yknow their thirteen year olds just rolled over from one to the other yknow 
from the best kid in town to sil yknow im running away im never going 
to school again so its tough and you wonder what causes it sil yeah yeah 
is it the family yknow where whered you go wrong yknow sil somebody needs to 
figure it out sil vocnoise thats it thats what i worry about the larger school 
systems too vocnoise thats whats sil concerns sil me with hilliard you get such a 
large variety of people sil compared to like where i was in this smaller group 
and you knew everybody and this and that its sil your parents knew their parent 
yeah your parents knew their parents their parents knew that yknow sil now sil yknow 
and i walked to my friends house and half her friends if shes going over 
to play they got to drive them almost because theyre vocnoise theyre all around so 
its not the neighborhood thing as much sil yeah and you cant let them run 
around as much as we did yknow we rode our bikes everywhere we rode to 
the pool we rode down to the store sil and now youre scared to let 
them ride around anywhere because youre afraid theyre not gonna come back yknow sil and 
so yeah sil its sil so many different things sil um it wasnt bad sil 
it was yknow i enjoyed a lot oh yeah sil i watched the first open 
heart sil transplant i saw sil the first liver transplant sil saw a lot of 
stuff like that and met a lot of cutoffpeople iver yeah i met a lot 
of different people in there vocnoise lot of interesting people iver um sil i helped 
them set up different things helped them sil yknow clean them up afterwards prep patients 
vocnoise all kinds of different things sil there was a lot of blood and stuff 
but vocnoise i dont know sil when you sil when its not you it seems 
a little laugh easier to sil observe i laughguess laugh vocnoise when you see somebody 
you know its a little sil more concerning to you i dont know vocnoise but 
sil youd see a lot of different stuff and vocnoise you hope that the majority 
of its sil helping this person out now my wife yknow she works vocnoise she 
worked in intensive care open heart surgery different patients like that vocnoise extand thats a 
lot different than where she is now sil with the cancer because theres so many 
different factors there youre vocnoise you know cutoffwih she says its so hard to see 
somebody sil thirty years old and vocnoise they come in and they have sil uh 
errorsbreast breast cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell 
them these things she says yknow vocnoise two or three times a week yknow your 
sil your heart just drops out because you see that they have their little kids 
and vocnoise now youre gonna be going for chemotherapy radiation all this stuff yknow vocnoise 
its unbelievable how many sil its just hard to believe how many sil people sil 
go through there vocnoise theyre talking fifty sixty patients a day iver where she works 
and this is just o s us breast cancer place so iver it cutoffjujust i 
just vocnoise i cant believe theres that many people that sil need the service all 
the time iver vocnoise theres like five or six different doctors and vocnoise so shes 
learned a lot more sil now than cancer because shes never been in oncology at 
all so vocnoise it was always just trauma patients or open heart sil bypass patients 
things like that sil so vocnoise its been a whole new learning experience for her 
too iver oh no she has to do yeah its chaos up there vocnoise it 
is chaos sil its i mean they had somebody come in to vocnoise oversee the 
whole sil setup to extsee vocnoise yknow where they needed more help at whether they 
needed more nurses or cutoffthethat and the guy sil told her the person that was 
in charge the head nurse or whatever vocnoise theres no way that person can do 
that job sil yknow sil they still do it yknow vocnoise so when youre in 
charge its just a nightmare youre supposed to know where every single patient is where 
their chart is whats going on what room theyre in where yknow vocnoise youre just 
sil walking around like youre a crazy person all day iver laughyeah laughthen vocnoise then 
its come home laughyknow laughthen laughits come home to that vocnoise and its so different 
its i dont know its just vocnoise the motherly thing the noisekids just vocnoise yknow 
they draw to their mothers iver its just the way it is i guess but 
vocnoise its like yknow she says if the mothers in the house the mothers on 
duty iver because yknow they sil they bypass me straight mom mom mom sil yknow 
iver yeah iver laughyeahand shes just like sil yeah the minute we walk in the 
door vocnoise its like you guys sil clock out laugh iver laughyknow iver yeah oh 
yeah the five year old just vocnoise after her the whole time the minute she 
walks in the door yknow iver go go go so vocnoise its tough iver oh 
they i do iver i try to be as much as possible too i think 
it its very important that sil both parents vocnoise they see both iver i do 
iver most my friends iver most people i associate with in this and that are 
vocnoise a lot more involved in their with their kids than sil say our parents 
were as kids yknow iver oh no vocnoise no sil i dont feel that at 
all they sil yknow sil we dont hesitate sil our vocnoise to get together with 
other friends and take our kids places i dont remember my dad doing that stuff 
yknow two or three dads get together and take six kids vocnoise to the park 
or something yknow vocnoise i dont remember things like that sil yknow vocnoise he couldve 
been there maybe but iver yknow we take them to wyandot lake or yknow the 
zoo or all types of things vocnoise oh yeah we got a sil the best 
thing you gotta get a membership to everything thats what we figured out we got 
cosi we got the zoo and we got wyandot lake vocnoise and that way you 
can go whenever you want vocnoise if sil an hour into the show vocnoise theyre 
not participating properly sil you can leave and you cutoffddidnt youre not out laughanything yknow 
yeah vocnoise yknow that cosis great we really like that sil they vocnoise really iver 
oh iver oh yeah were members of there iver oh yeah weve probably been five 
six times already vocnoise and iver its huge iver you cant see it in a 
day iver you cant especially with kids sil its just too overwhelming iver yeah iver 
at cosi iver yeah sil yeah iver yeah iver yep vocnoise yep theres a big 
water area its something to do with the little mermaid or whatever vocnoise but sil 
they really enjoy sil all that sil we try to vocnoise do as much as 
we can with them sil outdoor type of thing we do a lot of extcamping 
vocnoise we do a lot of vacationing we try to go two times a year 
at least vocnoise uh her parents live in cape cod so they iver we can 
get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have 
family in hawaii we have family in vocnoise virginia beach so iver everybodys cutoffcocoastal iver 
everybodys coastal but us iver and my sister lives in the middle of laughnebraska laugh 
nobody visits laughher laugh nobody wants laughtogo to nebraska vocnoise yeah whats out there unknown 
come watch the corn grow iver so iver yeah sil she does sil she comes 
back a lot sil they iver yeah they really like it they have a huge 
house sil in the sil middle of nowhere out on a extfarm and vocnoise my 
brother in law bought sil uh sil his fathers sil wendys businesses out sil and 
so they own like six wendys out there so vocnoise but its out in the 
middle of nowhere that was the whole problem we tried to get him to move 
and tried to get him to do this years and years ago and vocnoise nobody 
wanted to move to nebraska he was doing them from ohio which is really duh 
vocnoise running five wendys in nebraska and commuting sil so he was vocnoise either driving 
or flying a lot iver no i think sil hesi think they fly to omaha 
sil so its not too bad thats pretty easy to get into iver theyre about 
two hours west of omaha sil so sil its different for them iver theyre liking 
it yknow vocnoise small exttown vocnoise living out in the country raising the kids yknow 
their big house huge yard dog yknow vocnoise i sil we keep looking and saying 
yknow now hows this different or better for the kids so iver theyre uh five 
hours from extcolorado so they still bad lands arent too far hesaway vocnoise and i 
guess its like sil nine hundred miles from here so they can still drive back 
sil so vocnoise they come sil at least once twice a year sil back to 
ohio iver okay iver no big deal sil iver vocnoise iver yes um vocnoise undergraduate 
sil student iver first year vocnoise finishing it up vocnoise oh yeah vocnoise oh its 
definitely the vocnoise the beginning laugh iver the beginning of the end laugh vocnoise yep 
vocnoise um grew up in upper arlington vocnoise not far vocnoise yeah really those five 
miles make such a difference though vocnoise vocnoise like vocnoise because i yeah because i 
live on campus iver yeah vocnoise i live in uh siebert hall sil oh yeah 
i got vocnoise i think there are a hundred and seventy of us here for 
just from my class alone iver uh four twenty five iver yeah its been like 
that every year basically iver yeah its usually like about a third or something vocnoise 
extum vocnoise i think maybe two thirds of them live on campus vocnoise its just 
basically getting out of the house iver extum vocnoise just to get away from my 
parents for a while vocnoise yknow and its kind of good for me just to 
be away vocnoise its part of the experience vocnoise like learning do my own laundry 
and stuff i used unknown so bad about it and now all of a sudden 
vocnoise im vocnoise dont care really iver i i dont care about like having to 
do it vocnoise like my mom even wants me to do hers over summer im 
like okay vocnoise fine laugh iver vocnoise yeah i think so vocnoise um vocnoise met 
quite a few people from cleveland vocnoise and then my roommate is from north canton 
iver no not really um all my good friends from vocnoise well id say like 
vocnoise out of all my good friends from high school one of them no two 
of them are still here iver um i do so much just vocnoise not uh 
one of them i see just got vocnoise back from lunch with i mean i 
see him iver every day the other one i dont see that much anymore iver 
um well vocnoise shes got a boyfriend so shes busy laugh vocnoise and she lives 
off campus too sil so sil she lives out in hilliard actually its far laugh 
iver umhum vocnoise yeah she had an apartment in arlington and so they wanted to 
get an actual house iver so they built one out in hilliard iver yeah she 
still lives with family iver um um iver laugh iver um huh iver um laugh 
well the opinion kind of like the general consensus around upper arlington is that o 
s u is not a good enough school iver for everybody so youve you want 
to go to ivy league you dont even want to look here iver yknow so 
vocnoise they offered to accept me to med school here iver okay iver ill stay 
vocnoise yeah im in a uh vocnoise in the guinea pig class of this program 
through the medical school where after three years of undergrad i go to med school 
here vocnoise like without m cats or anything iver um i get a vocnoise b 
s which they vocnoise mail to me after first year of vocnoise medical school vocnoise 
like they figure that uh gross anatomy and all thats enough iver biology experience iver 
actually i do wasnt even that sure that i wanted to do it until um 
vocnoise like vocnoise senior year and the opportunity came up and i said to her 
oh vocnoise this sounds cool vocnoise yknow i had thought of myself as a uh 
a chemist vocnoise for a long time vocnoise and that this opportunity came up vocnoise 
yeah id applied to vocnoise like other places and i got into university of chicago 
vocnoise and i wanted to go there and then vocnoise this came up here and 
also i mean vocnoise its just ridiculously cheaper here i didnt want vocnoise debt after 
laughundergrad thats just pathetic vocnoise um my counselor just kind of found it and hed 
posted it and he specially vocnoise um vocnoise tried to notify the national merit people 
about it vocnoise and i was the only one who really caught it even though 
the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school vocnoise they 
all vocnoise one of them is at princeton right now vocnoise yknow and theyre vocnoise 
all off at their ivy leagues vocnoise like basically working their butts off to vocnoise 
get in when vocnoise im already in vocnoise i dont totally understand it iver yeah 
ohio state is like a really good medical school i dont vocnoise i dont know 
i think they just mainly didnt want to go to o s u like their 
egos or something yknow vocnoise im thinking of one in particular yknow rich parents just 
vocnoise wanted to go somewhere else iver yeah he they could afford to go there 
so they did iver laugh iver i think vocnoise um vocnoise the people who have 
already graduated theyre like the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who 
went here have a really good reputation vocnoise like among adults its just that the 
kids want to go vocnoise it its just thought of as a somewhat party school 
iver i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is vocnoise but 
vocnoise within the honors program i think theres some really really exceptional things going on 
iver yeah iver um vocnoise one of the requirements is we have to been in 
the honors college during undergraduate vocnoise and unknown fulfill all the requirements there iver vocnoise 
um you get priority for scheduling vocnoise you have to apply for it like seperately 
and i think you have to have like certain vocnoise um vocnoise class standing and 
s a t scores vocnoise or you can write an essay and theyll let you 
in anyways vocnoise um vocnoise lets see vocnoise you get vocnoise priority vocnoise for scheduling 
the i think you go after vocnoise varsity athletes and disabilities and thats it iver 
yeah vocnoise i think they do iver yeah they do vocnoise um vocnoise lets see 
vocnoise you have to complete either a thesis vocnoise or a contract which just consists 
of taking lots of honors classes iver and they have honors classes which are separate 
and vocnoise theyre supposed to be with like better faculty and um vocnoise smaller class 
size and a little more challenging iver my honors class is challenging and organic sil 
chemistry is very challenging but iver laugh iver no its not iver its vocnoise regulars 
enough for me in that vocnoise and i didnt have vocnoise i couldnt schedule the 
honors iver yes they do iver uh i almost think the honors would be better 
just because of smaller class size i have like four hundred in my class right 
now iver but vocnoise it kind of helps actually because uh vocnoise you have all 
the people in there who are not honors and they dont know how to cutoffsstudy 
like the partiers they dont know how to study or anything so iver yknow iver 
it helps the curve laugh iver vocnoise iver yeah i have to take organic i 
have to take um vocnoise biology chemistry physics vocnoise and then um i have to 
complete a major vocnoise if its biology i get a break i dont uh i 
only have to take twenty nine hours of it iver but other ones you have 
take the full major vocnoise yknow some people are doing uh vocnoise gosh i think 
ones doing business and ones doing economics and iver i think theyre doing different things 
like different people in the program but i kind of decided to take the easy 
road iver hm um early admission pathway sil umhum iver there extare vocnoise fifteen iver 
yeah um the medical school has pretty much limited them to ten percent of the 
sil of the medical school class which is two hundred twenty sil iver vocnoise yeah 
vocnoise iver yeah ill be starting in two thousand sil three iver laugh iver vocnoise 
um vocnoise the first year they made it sil in state only vocnoise sil um 
second sil and the second class that theyre gonna be starting they have some people 
from michigan i think iver yknow theyre just trying to spread out a little bit 
and eventually itll be something sil a little more nationwide sil but they really just 
wanted to start off with something easy vocnoise and um they only take national merit 
scholars in there iver so sil um sil vocnoise sil national merit scholars also get 
full in state tuition sil iver the sil thats why its mainly appealing to in 
state people you they pay you to go to school iver vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah 
that is one of the uh iver one of the vocnoise sil vocnoise whether if 
it sil its a written goal or not thats what theyre doing laugh iver vocnoise 
yeah it is vocnoise and sil it seems to me that they dont keep the 
very very best of the kids sil in state but it gets a lot of 
the vocnoise like vocnoise just below the absolute best in sil it keeps a lot 
of them here vocnoise iver sil where they could go somewhere else vocnoise sil iver 
sil iver vocnoise sil um i think vocnoise sil cutoffjujust sil just having like sil 
vocnoise sil such a low cost cutoffiit sil really helps sil vocnoise iver and um 
sil vocnoise i dont know i think having just cutoffthathat having the word sil honors 
gives it sil some kids enough prestige that they dont sil totally freak out about 
not going ivy league vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah parents are very into this um my 
sister sil vocnoise has no idea where she wants to go but uh vocnoise they 
took me around to all the different colleges to be sure what i wanted vocnoise 
laugh theyre just like sil excludename go to o s u laugh iver vocnoise yeah 
well she went with us last time and vocnoise she liked some stuff but sil 
iver sil i think shell end up coming here anyway iver vocnoise um i went 
to sil me see i applied to emory vocnoise harvard vocnoise duke vocnoise university of 
chicago and washington university sil so sil i got into three of those sil and 
sil they they were sil neat places but vocnoise iver sil vocnoise i know sil 
iver sil oh iver definitely iver definitely im such a slacker here its laughgreat laugh 
iver yeah vocnoise from what i hear actually the like the emory and the vocnoise 
um sil vocnoise university of chicago you have to work really hard vocnoise because they 
get all the kids who wish they would have got into harvard and then start 
sil yknow try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard 
nobody works vocnoise because theyre like we already made it yknow vocnoise iver sil iver 
vocnoise laugh sil iver sil iver vocnoise laugh iver vocnoise yeah i mean like it 
just sil it provides an a sil a window of opportunity for those who really 
do work like iver i know the valedictorian of harvard vocnoise like in the junior 
class im iver sil she went to my school she just barely works at all 
apparently iver sil yeah sil like iver sil nobody sil oh she is really sil 
plain smart i laughmean iver sil but you dont sil really have to work as 
hard there apparently sil iver vocnoise laugh iver vocnoise yeah i yeah thats sil another 
thing i hear about laughidontknow iver yeah iver yeah i hear about suicide rates when 
you dont get in laughin vocnoise sil iver i uh i think iver sil yeah 
i think i got really good uh um vocnoise ive actually been sitting thinking about 
it like what departments in school were good and which ones werent vocnoise um sil 
the foreign language is really good they have immersion classes from like at second level 
iver so i got into an immersion class here everybody else was freaking out and 
i was just used to it vocnoise iver yknow iver vocnoise um no english iver 
totally vocnoise like the directions and the homework sil and everything is all vocnoise one 
hundred percent in german iver so it and we had like tapes we listened to 
of native speakers so sil you sil got sil really good really quick vocnoise iver 
sil my iver yeah vocnoise it was like freshman or sophomore year iver vocnoise yeah 
um i took one oh four sil during vocnoise sil winter quarter vocnoise iver sil 
so thats all that they required im thinking about taking some extra anyway just because 
i like it vocnoise iver laugh vocnoise thats why i started it vocnoise iver sil 
now i just like it anyway and sil i like their culture a lot vocnoise 
iver vocnoise um ive been there twice already vocnoise iver sil yep sil iver um 
both times sil i stayed around this little town uh vocnoise its like northwest of 
munich sil so its southern vocnoise um mossberg sil iver sil oh vocnoise you know 
of those areas iver oh okay iver sil vocnoise yeah sil iver yeah iver yeah 
it was little had a little gymnasium in it vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise sil 
um well the first time i went officially with the exchange program the second time 
vocnoise i just went vocnoise and the exchange program happened to be there at the 
same time but i didnt go like under their insurance or on the same flight 
as them vocnoise i just kind of met up with them vocnoise iver laugh sil 
vocnoise it was more fun without being with vocnoise sil iver without being with them 
vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah i could skip any program i wanted to vocnoise sil yknow 
just show up at the parties basically vocnoise iver um iver i like how everybodys 
just a little more relaxed about stuff iver yknow like uh work hard vocnoise sil 
when you have to iver yknow which sil when you should is a sil better 
way of putting it vocnoise um iver sil and then sil when you dont take 
it easy vocnoise iver vocnoise sil yeah i think basically normal hours would be like 
eight to twelve and then you go home during sil lunch time because thats the 
big meal of day you go home and sil eat with your family sil thats 
sil really important iver and then sil um sil like people who work go back 
vocnoise until like yknow maybe two to six vocnoise um the kids are done with 
school for the day at sil like twelve one vocnoise iver umhum sil iver oh 
yeah yeah you work really hard while youre at it vocnoise and then when youre 
done youre done sil iver yeah sil vocnoise and theyre less hyper about like vocnoise 
yknow vocnoise bad things for people to do yknow the the drinking the smoking theres 
not as vocnoise strict about it basically iver vocnoise i mean you you kind of 
suffer your own consequences more vocnoise rather than having society like yell at you for 
it vocnoise iver vocnoise no they dont actually iver um sil its kind of funny 
youre allowed to drink before youre allowed to drive iver so um sil theres vocnoise 
from what i hear one of the exchange kids was in a car with a 
drunk person and had quite an experience with it iver vocnoise i mean no crash 
or anything but sil was vocnoise rather sil scared laugh kind of shaken up by 
it but um vocnoise no theyre sil very very serious about designated drivers iver vocnoise 
and um sil apparently when youre a car sil um they have a very very 
sil vocnoise like zero tolerance iver for alcohol sil like on your breath at all 
iver yeah they do vocnoise their trains are so cool i love those laugh iver 
vocnoise yeah they are iver yep iver vocnoise yeah iver yep iver yeah theyre theyre 
really good about that sil iver umhum iver vocnoise yeah they do vocnoise i thought 
it was really cool we went hiking in the alps and somebody told us that 
sil um sil if you are determined as having too much stress by your doctor 
then the government will pay for a vacation for you vocnoise iver just theyre that 
into sil being sure youre relaxed enough iver sil you know and nobody does the 
sixty hour work weeks like sil some people apparently are accustomed to around here vocnoise 
sil iver i mean forty is like the limit vocnoise iver vocnoise sil yeah they 
do um vocnoise sil i think its something like sixty percent iver um we pay 
like forty fifty here vocnoise sil oh yeah sil vocnoise well theres like vocnoise and 
you take federal and state and all that and add it up iver yeah they 
have vocnoise sil uh vocnoise sil well okay they do have sales tax but its 
added in to the price before vocnoise so youre not just noise sitting there trying 
to figure out what it is vocnoise iver sil iver sil iver sil iver laugh 
iver vocnoise i wish they could iver yeah oh my uh laugh sil vocnoise im 
in this uh venturing crew which is sil through boy scouts our leader has this 
sil like sil society totally planned out iver laugh hes got this thing like vocnoise 
thirty percent sales tax and no other tax at all and then sil iver sil 
it all sil gets sil i dont know it all works itself out he he 
sil every other day you start him on taxes and hell just start fuming vocnoise 
iver its sil vocnoise um vocnoise sil hes uh business man vocnoise iver sil he 
really doesnt like it vocnoise like how things work iver vocnoise yeah vocnoise iver its 
called hesuh uh venturing crew vocnoise its kind of this off hesuh off shoot of 
uh boy scouts vocnoise sil and its for ages teen twenty one sil uh co 
ed sil iver vocnoise so vocnoise sil we focus on computers but sil we sil 
do camping and vocnoise sil yknow vocnoise sil he teaches us a lot of uh 
business uh business ethic and iver um professionalism as well vocnoise iver yes iver sil 
yeah sil its sil like um sil i dont know they used to have something 
called exploring posts vocnoise sil that were directly related and then sil um sil venturing 
kind of took over for that like sil in still in boy scouts and then 
vocnoise sil exploring went off on its own sil and vocnoise as a result they 
took religion out of the program and they put vocnoise sil they extallow like homosexuality 
with the leaders and all that vocnoise sil so its vocnoise sil i dont know 
we call it like hippy boy scouts laugh iver sil um one of my best 
friends from sil high school and my boyfriend are both in it sil and vocnoise 
sil they bugged me about it for ever to come and like i dont know 
about computers laugh so they sil took me finally like december something iver and and 
i have an office within the posi within the um vocnoise sil program now and 
vocnoise sil yeah and its just incredible how much ive learned vocnoise sil i think 
i learn more in that program than i do in all my classes put together 
vocnoise sil iver vocnoise yes and no vocnoise sil i mean we have high schoolers 
in there vocnoise vocnoise um vocnoise theres no requirements for what school you go to 
um vocnoise but we get sil our vocnoise sil internet service partially through ohio state 
vocnoise sil and unknown the vast majority of college students go here sil sil iver 
vocnoise sil um what happened was we know see one of the people on our 
committee vocnoise sil teaches in the math department here iver so he the math server 
has tons of extra room on it vocnoise so he just kind of snuck in 
our account vocnoise sil vocnoise sil i it is legal but im not sil sure 
how related to university is iver vocnoise sil vocnoise i dont think we take up 
huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through oar net as 
well sil which is sil i think its just up lane avenue sil uh they 
give us the domain name and all that sil iver yeah i vocnoise oh gosh 
seems like incredible i mean sil i i used to not understand what the right 
click on windows was laugh that was like when i moved in and now all 
of a sudden like sil i cant i installed my own d v d player 
in my computer vocnoise like tore the case off and did it iver its actually 
not that difficult but vocnoise sil iver sil vocnoise yeah cutoffits its um vocnoise sil 
i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and sil 
there it is vocnoise sil yknow sil um sil lets see what was sil vocnoise 
sil my sil decoder card was a little more difficult i had somebody else do 
it for me sil iver um i have a decoder card it sil what it 
does is it make sil it decodes the d v d vocnoise right away rather 
than sending it through the processor sil so its vocnoise sil its a lot faster 
it doesnt depend on my processor time like it sil the movie doesnt skip or 
anything sil it it just goes straight through sil um sil lets see vocnoise no 
no nothing like that uh sil twice a month we have sil our technical modules 
which are vocnoise sil we hook up the tiny little yknow green screen computers and 
the little old keyboards from like nineteen eighty five vocnoise sil yknow sit there and 
tinker on those sil iver and then once month well have a leadership module which 
is uh vocnoise sil the business ethics sil part sil and yknow set goal setting 
and that type thing sil vocnoise sil and then once month well just have like 
donatos pizza vocnoise sil vocnoise sil and like sil just just discuss basic sil and 
just general things vocnoise well like events coming up we had sil vocnoise we planted 
the flowers at murfield vocnoise sil last weekend and the weekend before vocnoise sil was 
it two sil vocnoise sil i dont know i cant wait for it to start 
just because i want to watch it on tv and like i planted those vocnoise 
laugh you see the the nick sil jack nicholas golf statue sil in front of 
the clubhouse i planted the flowers around that laugh sil no i i dont want 
to watch it for the golf at all i just want turn it on and 
see it occasionally iver yep sil vocnoise iver vocnoise yeah i probably will sil vocnoise 
yeah iver vocnoise sil um yeah actually vocnoise sil laugh they had just posted something 
on the cutoffininternet on the email today they have these old machines that used to 
be vocnoise sil uh theyre called three b twos and sil a t and t 
used to run on them sil iver sil and theyre just really old and sil 
vocnoise sil i mean just ridiculously like seventies laugh just ridiculous and hes giving them 
out sil but the only thing is if you take one you have to finish 
sil like you have to vocnoise sil um sil install a disk drive sil iver 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out 
totally on your own sil vocnoise sil vocnoise im thinking i may get into that 
laugh iver sil for like summer project or something sil iver sil vocnoise sil extum 
vocnoise sil vocnoise sil i like this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and 
playing computer games first of all because vocnoise sil its more interesting its a lot 
more practical sil yknow its little more problem solving less running around and shooting things 
vocnoise yknow um vocnoise sil vocnoise sil its like problem solving type sil yknow little 
puzzles its sil not as much sil sit in front of a tv and be 
entertained its vocnoise sil you create your own vocnoise entertainment vocnoise sil sil no iver 
um sil vocnoise sil its an ego trip thats all unknown basically vocnoise sil its 
like look i can do this vocnoise iver you know i was sitting down uh 
in my boyfriends room and my roommate was sitting up in my room alone and 
i had my computer on sil vocnoise sil but sil nobody was sitting at it 
sil iver and um sil from downstairs sil we broke into my computer vocnoise iver 
and started playing uh m p threes iver sil like while she was studying or 
something i think we played this homer simpson stuff laughshegot cutoffsso vocnoise she got so 
mad it was so worth it laugh iver shes the type of person i love 
to annoy vocnoise sil iver vocnoise my roommate iver sil iver vocnoise sil we have 
uh vocnoise yeah we have iver typical dorm room sil iver laugh iver sil vocnoise 
sil uh we have sil um vocnoise desks sil and then lofted beds sil iver 
sil you have the option take your bed down i had to take mine down 
because i broke my ankle fall quarter vocnoise iver so its sil still just sitting 
down and my computer sits next to it vocnoise sil um sil the only thing 
is if you take it down you can only have half a desk sil iver 
sil vocnoise thats still enough for me iver sil a place for sil computer to 
sit and my plants sit in the corner and then vocnoise sil i have my 
little sil paper stack sil vocnoise sil iver vocnoise sil mm vocnoise iver you should 
uh vocnoise unknown you should be organized im not laugh i have this stack of 
like groceries maybe about a foot high sitting sil next to my bed vocnoise sil 
just when we out and bought groceries and then the commons sil open again vocnoise 
sil iver oh they it was nice sil actually sil i ate sil a sil 
lot more healthy vocnoise sil and sil um it was cheaper i was getting money 
on my buck i d vocnoise sil so i actually got paid every day sil 
iver yeah vocnoise sil they gave us nine dollars a day it was like nine 
twenty five for what meal plan i was on sil vocnoise sil so then sil 
um we bought like pop tarts and that lasted for like a week of breakfast 
iver for two bucks yknow you cant beat that iver and then um sil lets 
see sil usually go out to vocnoise lunch at like hessome sil fast food place 
vocnoise and then we get together and cook dinner iver yeah we have a little 
kitchen iver uh ive learned a lot about cooking sil lately laugh iver hesyeah vocnoise 
i i thought sil in the beginning i missed mirror lake cafe so bad because 
the good subs and all that vocnoise i dont sil vocnoise i dont know why 
i missed them i dont vocnoise i go back and now i just dont like 
it anymore iver yeah ive been thoroughly spoiled yknow like catfish biff subs those are 
laughgood iver oh cutoffthetheyre vocnoise theyre very good sil like you call vocnoise i usually 
just call and then i walk down and by the time i get there vocnoise 
the subs are ready iver oh is it vocnoise its a little farther iver yeah 
iver no not really noise vocnoise i dont know what even is to eat down 
here sil oxleys laugh iver oxleys is probably the vocnoise closest place iver vocnoise and 
those little hot dog stands sil those really dont count iver which one is that 
iver extoh yeah vocnoise adriaticos iver umhum vocnoise mondays and tuesdays sil they have hesthe 
sil cheap pizza iver yeah they have a deal exton monday and tuesday i think 
its like after five p m iver the sil cutoffchcheap sil pizzas really cheap iver 
extoh noise yeah iver yeah that wouldnt work laugh iver our dorms were cleaner iver 
our our janitor is worthless laughum vocnoise basically it hesum we were complaining about it 
like earlier during the year sil three complaints have uh formal complaints sil have been 
filed against him and he still refuses to change the bleach water sil like more 
than once a week vocnoise its really sil disgusting vocnoise so we had these temps 
come in one day and it was sil we went in uh like were in 
shock it was so clean iver they did they didnt come every extday but yknow 
they came occasionally and it helped and vocnoise hesum sil we mopped our own floor 
like on the hall a few times it we just basically need the sil bathrooms 
done iver yknow and i wouldnt be too opposed to do that myself if it 
would keep the cost down around here iver you know vocnoise i dont iver hesand 
vocnoise i dont know commons i dont i didnt miss bus service i kind of 
missed because vocnoise um sil aarons car is out sil on west campus but vocnoise 
i went home and got my dads a laughpass laugh he teaches in the dental 
school but he only teaches on fridays sil so he has that a pass available 
all the time laugh so our car is parked extright next to the building iver 
yeah were gonna have to give it up by friday vocnoise because sil the strikes 
over they wont let us keep it sil anymore iver oh i wish yeah i 
do it during summer too i usually work down here iver just over summer and 
i use the a pass vocnoise and then i drive my dad down on fridays 
iver yeah iver i cutoffthithink iver vocnoise theyre justified to go on strike anytime they 
want to however how they sil behaved during the strike was just extdisgusting i mean 
iver like sitting out heson the street all the time like sil uh sil honking 
the horns ringing the bells doing the extwhistles the vocnoise really annoying chants um vocnoise 
i had classes in the b and z sil building vocnoise that we just had 
to cancel because they were too loud iver um sil yeah across streets the dental 
sil and the hospital vocnoise so people were really loud down there iver and we 
couldnt have class hesand sil in addition they were like trying to tip over buses 
and throwing stones at them iver when they drove by i guess iver vocnoise theres 
no need to attack students over it and sil i read some article vocnoise in 
the lantern i dont know why i read that but um vocnoise i hate that 
paper but anyway vocnoise um i read some article that the guy said hes not 
trying to attack students he just wants them to get annoyed so theyll extgo whine 
to their parents about how the university does it vocnoise and then they can all 
fight the establishment and sil iver it makes me sil angry that people like that 
even get sil money vocnoise iver vocnoise no it didnt as a matter of fact 
i told my parents yknow noise university is handling it vocnoise so well by extnot 
vocnoise giving them the money because they dont deserve it vocnoise yknow vocnoise and iver 
yeah hesand iver yeah sil um sil vocnoise it was just hesreally sil disgusting how 
they extbehaved vocnoise hesand vocnoise a lot of yelling at extstudents sil hesand that was 
extreally unnecessary sil i they vocnoise just totally approached it from the wrong sil point 
and vocnoise i mean there were some students that actually heswere sil supporting them iver 
and they were being very vocal about it but the vast majority of people that 
i sil talked to vocnoise were so against the strikers iver yeah they were cutoffffor 
pro strike were getting money on buck i ds but yeah iver we wanted it 
to keep on going vocnoise sil but sil hesit vocnoise they just didnt need to 
sil do like that and then i think once they noticed that the uh vocnoise 
commons were gonna open without them they realized that sil university is functioning sil or 
was functioning fine without them iver and decided to go back to their jobs vocnoise 
cutoffiif if you noticed the first time that they voted vocnoise they voted down this 
proposal the proposal that their voting on this week is the exact same one iver 
uh nobody really admits it but vocnoise oh i grabbed the paper because i wanted 
to see what the agreement was and its pretty much the same thing vocnoise and 
sil exttheyre sil voting positively for it this time iver vocnoise i wouldnt iver i 
wouldnt doubt it sil i hope they vote against it but i dont think they 
will iver just because its been sil three weeks now yknow and vocnoise not sil 
only that theres uh something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two 
weeks and extthe union has to pay their full wages for the work that they 
miss iver hesand sil unions not gonna do that sil unknown iver yeah iver hm 
iver yeah vocnoise i just think you cant vocnoise you cant call for across the 
board vocnoise raises there definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than 
what theyre getting iver and there are some people that deserve to be fired sil 
and theres no way that you can really sil differentiate just because theyre in a 
union they iver take that extaway iver hesand sil its really unfortunate for the good 
workers in there because vocnoise i mean the people at mirror lake are so extgreat 
iver yeah theyre all extreally hesnice sil iver yknow and hesthey vocnoise work hard vocnoise 
yknow to make it sil easier on the students vocnoise yknow totally restructured the place 
since the beginning of the year iver just to make it easier on everybody iver 
noise its good place vocnoise they even stopped playing the ghetto music laugh they had 
this jukebox and it was exthorrible they played the same three songs with like horribly 
offensive lyrics and hesno vocnoise melody whatsoever iver hesand sil they stopped doing that now 
vocnoise iver yeah probably iver vocnoise hesum sil i just think sil hesits vocnoise hesuh 
horribly biased paper they dont sil really take their hesuh sil what is it hesuh 
sil hesthe sil vocnoise extjournalistic sil like sil extunbiased vocnoise integrity they dont take that 
seriously iver oh its most of it is liberal vocnoise and vocnoise hestheyve sil always 
find some way hesto sil misrepresent sil like sil hesuh kirwan iver they always find 
some vocnoise silly way to slant his words and make him extlook bad and vocnoise 
its really disgusting i laughmean iver yeah iver vocnoise yeah hesand sil since its not 
sil hesum sil sponsored officially by extthe sil hesum sil university they can do whatever 
they want and they dont have any vocnoise hesuh extpossibility extof vocnoise um vocnoise im 
looking for a word here laugh uh repercussions iver no theyre not its printed at 
the top every sil on every issue sil that they are sil financially cutoffsseperate independent 
iver so therefore they can sil theyre not public they can put whatever they want 
iver laugh iver vocnoise iver i am during different points of the day laughidontknow iver 
hesum sil as far as affiliated with vocnoise a party vocnoise i extprobably vocnoise respond 
extto sil hesum sil republicans more than democrats hesbut vocnoise i think given any sil 
um sil given any choice of any sil party sil at all vocnoise im probably 
more libertarian than anything else iver vocnoise just vocnoise yknow its sil let people make 
their own mistakes and then sil but dont make me pay for it yeah iver 
who am i going to vote for iver i have no idea its kind of 
like picking the vocnoise the least of evils i mean iver i dont really see 
anybody i was totally ready to vote for elizabeth dole and then vocnoise she opened 
her mouth and things came out laughand laugh uh she had the best chance out 
of any uh vocnoise any woman thats ever run vocnoise for president and vocnoise she 
was vocnoise in a major party vocnoise which vocnoise hasnt happened before vocnoise and it 
would have been really funny to see what happened to bob dole over it laugh 
vocnoise yknow be the first vocnoise man after heshaving run for the office iver i 
dont know vocnoise i vocnoise i kind of see al gore winning just because vocnoise 
hes the most like iver one of the cutoffmomost vocnoise he has the most experience 
iver in that sil general extarea vocnoise um iver i dont know i dont particularly 
like sil anyone iver really iver although i havent been paying a lot of attention 
to it vocnoise just because vocnoise i dont know iver yeah and because vocnoise i 
vocnoise back when i was in high school in my a p government class i 
was paying attention a lot yknow like vocnoise i read the cutoffg sil columbus dispatch 
everyday and i read u s news and world report sil for my economics class 
and i was vocnoise totally caught up with everything iver and then i got here 
like vocnoise i dont cutoffwawant vocnoise i dont care laugh yknow iver yeah and vocnoise 
i i got to argue about stuff there here im just kind of sitting around 
laugh iver like trying to cram organic into my head and iver playing around with 
my linux laughyknow laugh iver yeah a lot more vocnoise just iver different iver things 
vocnoise yeah just vocnoise keeping my vocnoise g p a up enough and iver yeah 
i really really hate the fact vocnoise of a government telling me what to do 
iver i really hate that vocnoise um vocnoise and like affirmative action stuff totally burns 
me up the idea is wonderful but its vocnoise cutoffsso vocnoise its just sil executed 
very poorly vocnoise i mean i saw like vocnoise during high school how easy it 
was for me to get in to places i mean the citadel was begging me 
to come iver yeah yeah they called me like a few times and just begging 
me to come i know how hard that is for vocnoise uh vocnoise white males 
to get into iver its vocnoise and i saw like one of my friends had 
to work so hard to get into m i t iver and then vocnoise there 
was another girl who vocnoise i really didnt think was vocnoise that smart shes kind 
of vocnoise um vocnoise inner blond vocnoise and she got in laugh sil yeah iver 
yeah its just iver i see it working sil extunfairly iver and vocnoise i vocnoise 
dont think that it sil is just vocnoise executed properly vocnoise so vocnoise i would 
almost rather have it sil not at all iver than vocnoise have it executed sil 
as it is now iver think in the case of a tie it should be 
used but vocnoise yknow like if theres vocnoise a black woman who is vocnoise very 
well qualified for a job vocnoise and a white male is vocnoise equally qualified for 
the job the black woman should get it iver but vocnoise im like if test 
scores are identical and they have the exact same experience vocnoise yknow objective sil ways 
iver they are identical vocnoise then the black woman should get the job vocnoise but 
sil there is no sil to me vocnoise the most qualified should cutoffperperson person should 
get the job vocnoise end of story vocnoise and thats it vocnoise yknow its vocnoise 
its best for vocnoise society in general iver just employers need to be vocnoise employers 
just need to do that on their own vocnoise and its tough to be able 
to trust sil uh business like that but vocnoise its a private business they need 
to be able to iver yknow they can do whatever they want iver um iver 
i do not like laughbussing laugh vocnoise i just dont sil um vocnoise i think 
its sil its kind of like you get what you pay for iver anyway and 
vocnoise um vocnoise im not saying in general but with the experiences that ive had 
vocnoise um certain families where they dont sil uh socioeconomically just not as well off 
iver it doesnt matter how much money theyre given for their education theyve cutoffsseen iver 
they wont take vocnoise proper advantage of it vocnoise because cutoffthethey sil they vocnoise have 
their parents to look up to vocnoise who didnt take advantage of it iver yknow 
so if its kind of the mentality if my parents did okay without it then 
i dont need it iver so the moneys just kind of wasted iver oh yeah 
laugh iver yes iver yes iver hum iver no i havent laugh iver okay vocnoise 
no i havent been following it really iver vocnoise its not that the vocnoise property 
taxes are that much higher anyway its that vocnoise um sil the homes are worth 
more because of the school system iver and the safety of the neighborhood and vocnoise 
yeah there there are a few things vocnoise really that go into it iver yeah 
it basically vocnoise feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes sil cutoffeexorbitantly 
vocnoise exorbitantly high i mean they it is a little higher but yeah sil it 
its not ridiculously high iver yeah sil it is vocnoise worth more vocnoise what i 
cant understand is some people live in upper arlington vocnoise and they send their kids 
to laughprivateschool iver i dont understand that iver yeah you spend the money to live 
there and then you go somewhere else vocnoise i really dont understand that vocnoise some 
people do it iver yeah it was pretty much upper middle class iver um sil 
and like even the people the maybe their apartments didnt look as impressive but they 
were making money iver and like vocnoise uh one of my friends sil who had 
the apartment vocnoise in arlington iver they had this little apartment vocnoise shes from sil 
india vocnoise um iver her house in india is like this mansion and they have 
servants there vocnoise i mean its vocnoise really sil impressive just vocnoise the vocnoise houses 
are just worth more so you cant get as much house here laugh vocnoise but 
yeah everybody is doing well laugh iver yeah iver it depends on what area you 
live in too vocnoise the area where i live in you get vocnoise little house 
vocnoise because youre close to everything vocnoise whereas you get kind of farther away from 
the center of sil the area you can get a bigger house and vocnoise theres 
some really really pretty ones iver yeah and um the cutoffen vocnoise the uh smaller 
house like sil bigger squished in areas vocnoise are noise uh the older area iver 
and then as the vocnoise community fanned out then vocnoise they had bigger houses vocnoise 
i like living in the old area better vocnoise i like the houses in the 
new area better vocnoise theres one in particular thats just vocnoise gorgeous iver they have 
this vocnoise entrance and there are these trees on the inside of the house theyre 
just growing down into everything and there are like crystals and they have this one 
room that looks like a sphinx and then they have vocnoise um vocnoise this backyard 
that looks all yknow cute vocnoise old england vocnoise its really really cool house iver 
has this little bridge that goes up to the front door vocnoise and a creek 
i laulghmeanitscool iver um yes some of the guys from venturing crew live there laugh 
iver yeah we did vocnoise we had a um they called lan parties vocnoise they 
are parties where everybody takes their computer and you hookem up to cutoffn into a 
network and then you play games iver yknow we had one of the parties up 
there and vocnoise they had this vocnoise um big like pyramid shaped thing vocnoise i 
i forget what they call it vocnoise its like a crystal something vocnoise i dont 
know but they have a speaker hook up to it vocnoise and the structure of 
it makes the sound resonate like crazy vocnoise they have subwoofers sitting under it and 
theres this bed in the middle so i ended up falling asleep there one night 
vocnoise somebody woke me up with the music ah laugh iver oh its vocnoise yeah 
its definitely weird iver its really cool vocnoise yeah vocnoise yeah iver very new age 
laugh iver umhum vocnoise got a few ideas vocnoise um im thinking i might be 
a o b g y n just iver they need a lot of women in 
that field vocnoise yknow they needs vocnoise good people there vocnoise um vocnoise the money 
didnt hurt laugh vocnoise just iver its good money vocnoise yeah vocnoise um one idea 
that ive just had recently is medical informatist vocnoise which vocnoise is a person who 
has an m d vocnoise and does computers vocnoise since those are my two main 
interests i thought vocnoise doing both would be really cool iver and im meeting with 
someone on thursday actually whos vocnoise in that field vocnoise its really just an open 
field iver yeah iver uh its iver it is where bioinformatics was about a year 
or two ago iver just really starting to get started and i mean vocnoise somebody 
vocnoise you have an m d thats enough yknow you want somebody who has computer 
skills as well vocnoise thats iver difficult to find iver yeah the other way around 
is probably even harder laugh iver it does iver yeah you just see like vocnoise 
all the different kinds vocnoise i think even if i dont want to go into 
it yknow vocnoise rotations in every single vocnoise area will be interesting like vocnoise i 
shadowed in the uh vocnoise psych ward last week vocnoise and laugh vocnoise that was 
really interesting vocnoise and i have feeling im gonna love my rotation but i vocnoise 
dont want to be a psychiatrist iver no as for it was kind of disturbing 
actually iver yeah vocnoise yeah i saw the patients in the morning iver yep iver 
oh yeah iver yeah iver oh um well i thought about being a medical scientist 
vocnoise with m d p h d they do um vocnoise research vocnoise like vocnoise 
um vocnoise with applications to medicine but more in the vocnoise biochemistry field vocnoise or 
genetics or something like that iver that vocnoise that would be seriously fun vocnoise but 
vocnoise uh it depends if you work industry you get money iver if you work 
at a college sil or vocnoise a hospital you make vocnoise no money vocnoise yeah 
pretty much vocnoise it seems like it vocnoise i vocnoise i wanted to for a 
long time now im just not so sure that i want the vocnoise two or 
three more years of school vocnoise they suggest two to three years for your p 
h d like vocnoise i dont wanna do that iver too much iver um yeah 
vocnoise thats vocnoise what they suggest doing is two years of med school vocnoise get 
your p h d sil and then do your sil last two years of med 
school iver and then you do vocnoise your residency vocnoise you dont have to do 
a residency but sil if you ever wanna vocnoise go clinical vocnoise you have to 
do it iver yeah iver yeah just ridiculous amounts of stuff im like i dont 
wanna do that iver yeah iver yeah i would be at least thirty maybe looking 
uh towards forty before i have the experience really necessary vocnoise to get into good 
jobs like vocnoise i dont wanna be i mean like vocnoise my vocnoise uh vocnoise 
venturing crew vocnoise advisor is thirty eight and retired i mean laugh vocnoise i im 
going more for there laugh iver um a lot of good investments a lot of 
saving vocnoise a lot of living well below means vocnoise and i wanna own six 
businesses laugh vocnoise yeah um his definition of vocnoise retired is basically um sil he 
doesnt have to work vocnoise he does but he doesnt have to so vocnoise he 
just finished up a temp job up at uh qwest vocnoise yep i think he 
gets paid like three seventy five an hour now iver yeah thats how he gets 
so much money he says sil i vocnoise will be paid this much vocnoise and 
i will be given this many um had this much minimum per day vocnoise or 
im not working for you and vocnoise they usually say no no no we wont 
do that yknow and then theyll call back a week later vocnoise okay well take 
you laugh vocnoise he has some really good stories about that vocnoise oh yeah vocnoise 
he has qualifications businesses and also with uh unix vocnoise which is iver um vocnoise 
i dont know do you know anything about unix iver okay vocnoise yeah he does 
iver i think he specializes in like solaris and h p u x vocnoise and 
iver yeah he says he knows vocnoise the v m s as well but sil 
he doesnt like to do it so he doesnt do it laugh iver yeah hes 
teaching us uh system five vocnoise its laughjustfunny iver okay vocnoise um vocnoise its vocnoise 
like two now iver okay iver sil excludename vocnoise iver alright iver vocnoise iver um 
vocnoise well ive vocnoise lived in columbus all my life vocnoise never laugh cant say 
i ever really leave too often vocnoise um vocnoise i have a brother sister vocnoise 
uh vocnoise obviously parents theyre vocnoise divorced i live with my mom vocnoise sil um 
i live up around the beechwold area sil uh sil really as vocnoise far as 
ohio state goes im a freshman here vocnoise uh just started winter quarter vocnoise um 
vocnoise i like it for the most part its little bit sil much vocnoise sil 
much different actually than vocnoise sil high school was and that kind of vocnoise surprised 
me just sil all the sorts of changes and cutoffththey sil vocnoise things like that 
going on vocnoise sil but other than that i mean i seem to like it 
i mean its vocnoise sil definitely changes for the better its a lot more vocnoise 
sil just free i mean i get to do vocnoise whatever you want i mean 
theres no one vocnoise watching over you saying what you have to do all the 
time and sil everything like that sil iver vocnoise sil um sil i am signed 
up for architecture right now vocnoise which sil i like architecture but i think theres 
probably more time vocnoise into it than im ready to sil actually commit into it 
iver and so i think ill probably end up changing i dont know what to 
itd probably be more towards the education line iver um just i mean i like 
everything about architecture i mean thats actually vocnoise what i do as a job right 
now i mean im vocnoise sil like building things im vocnoise like adding on a 
sil bedroom and a bathroom iver onto a house sil but sil its just sil 
more time consuming than i think im ready sil iver to put into it sil 
iver sil um vocnoise iver yes and no i mean sil in high school it 
was a bunch of little things here its sil not so much a lot of 
things iver its cutoffsits sil major things that you have to do that are a 
lot more time consuming iver yeah exactly sil vocnoise which is one of the things 
i ran into architecture where vocnoise i mean we only had yknow one or two 
papers we had to write iver but there were one or two vocnoise eight or 
nine page papers about a building that you had to go put sil hours worth 
of research into and then sketch and vocnoise and it was just vocnoise iver vocnoise 
exactly yeah vocnoise iver vocnoise sil um vocnoise sil actually vocnoise sil i guess its 
something thats always started sil sort of been there vocnoise always been real big on 
just building things mean been vocnoise real big hands on vocnoise sil and sil last 
summer i helped my dad vocnoise uh vocnoise put a garage onto his house vocnoise 
sil um vocnoise like i mean literally i mean we poured the foundation and everything 
like build everything up from there vocnoise sil and it turned out really well and 
i mean it was sil really fun to do i mean vocnoise its vocnoise i 
liked it a lot better than being stuck sil inside all the time iver and 
vocnoise just ya know sort of doing the same old same old everyday there it 
was always something different i have to be outside sil and it was just a 
lot sil easier to do vocnoise sil iver um laugh actually its more sil its 
almost actually turned into like a self business sil um sil like i said it 
started out with my dad and then people would ask me what i was doing 
id tell them vocnoise theyd be like oh i have some things around the house 
that need to be done and vocnoise so id go there and theyd tell people 
and iver id get more sil people asking me for that and i mean it 
turns out pretty nice im making vocnoise about ten or eleven bucks an hour iver 
sil and i mean its basically any time i have free i mean its not 
like i have a set schedule of when i have to work things like that 
its just vocnoise whenever i feel like i have to do it iver i do 
it so iver laugh iver um sil actually oddly enough thats what im putting in 
vocnoise iver one of the bathrooms right now is a jacuzzi vocnoise um thats sil 
not really too hard but the hardest sil thing to do is electrical work vocnoise 
like its just because its more intimidating iver vocnoise sil than it is iver difficult 
sil exactly getting iver getting electrocuted or something yeah vocnoise sil that just doesnt appeal 
to me too much but i mean its sil really not too difficult i mean 
as long as youre vocnoise careful and iver think about things i mean its pretty 
easy to do iver yeah we lived vocnoise sil um vocnoise we moved about sil 
five or six years ago vocnoise um vocnoise and the house we had before was 
some big like eighty ninety year old house iver sil and sil i mean obviously 
it needed a lot of repairs because its pretty old and there were just things 
that hed do and i guess just vocnoise picking up watching him seeing what he 
would do thats iver where it took me to iver sil and it just sort 
of vocnoise sparked an interest in me i guess and vocnoise it just grew from 
there iver yeah iver laugh iver yeah ive run into that a lot i think 
sil part of it was the high school i went to i mean ive gone 
to vocnoise catholic schools all my life or whatever vocnoise and vocnoise obviously ive run 
into vocnoise a lot more of the wealthier type people who vocnoise either just dont 
have time or dont have the interest and just pay people to do it iver 
and as a result sil unknown like there are vocnoise kids my age and stuff 
like that that ive talked to i mean they have no idea whats going on 
iver which sil i mean isnt necessarily a bad thing but sil i mean its 
something thats definitely noticeable in there iver oh did you iver umhum iver laugh iver 
oh yeah its iver oh yeah iver yeah plus i mean you laugh save a 
lot of money too i mean iver laugh iver vocnoise kind of ive seen a 
few of like infomercials on stuff like that sil um but i cant say anything 
too vocnoise serious has come up from it iver um vocnoise i mean id thats 
definitely a possibility for career wise down the road but sil um vocnoise i dont 
know ill have to see vocnoise laughsortofwherethat takes me vocnoise iver i went extto vocnoise 
excludename for grade school sil and excludename for high school vocnoise iver sil um vocnoise 
excludename sil that is on excludename road iver like ninety nine east excludename road or 
something like that iver uh noise sil it cutoffwwasnt sil wasnt anything too huge i 
think it had about twelve hundred people in it or so iver um vocnoise it 
i mean it was sil pretty good place i mean looking vocnoise back on it 
sil i remembered a lot better than when i was actually there iver obviously i 
mean it was just something that sil just i mean you dont really appreciate it 
until vocnoise sil youve gone through it iver and then vocnoise sil remember back on 
it iver yeah sil iver um vocnoise sil i dont really think theres sil any 
huge difference vocnoise um vocnoise sil i can say from what ive seen vocnoise sil 
the people that went to the catholic schools vocnoise um sil they are a little 
bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like 
that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the vocnoise public schools 
are laugh really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here 
iver sil um sil and i definitely i mean sil ive vocnoise think i went 
to like kindergarten in the public school so i dont really know vocnoise too much 
about like the kind of curriculums and things that they had to do vocnoise but 
i know i mean as far as going to excludename vocnoise a lot of the 
stuff like in math and things like that vocnoise sil that im doing now vocnoise 
is stuff i already covered in high school so i already have a basis for 
it iver um so i think that sil part definitely helps whereas most of my 
other friends you know theyre kind of lost they dont know vocnoise exactly what theyre 
doing vocnoise um where like said ive vocnoise already vocnoise done all the stuff that 
were doing now and know vocnoise how to go about it and iver how to 
do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest differences just sil 
really the amount of sil education you get iver i would say for the most 
part that that sil not vocnoise is not really true iver um sil i would 
cutoffssay tend to say most people i know are sil at least fairly ethical i 
mean vocnoise laughtheresnomore vocnoise sinister group than the other that i know iver i mean 
obviously everyone has their dark side but id say cutoffnm vocnoise in general people are 
vocnoise pretty good people iver i mean vocnoise theres nothing bad about them or anything 
that they iver sil iver vocnoise oh yeah all the time iver yeah that part 
was no different i mean iver no iver um vocnoise noise vocnoise there were one 
or two iver vocnoise um vocnoise i guess that would be a slightly different part 
im errornonnot vocnoise not really sure how big of a problem that is in public 
schools but vocnoise mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up 
going to public school the next year iver um so im sure that laughprobably increases 
the rate in public schools from iver the catholic schools iver expelling iver um iver 
what they do vocnoise uh vocnoise they have like up to four or five months 
vocnoise the first four or five months pregnancy theyre aloud to maintain vocnoise once they 
start to show sil they dont let them go to the school anymore just for 
vocnoise their vocnoise uh health of the baby iver um sil so they vocnoise sort 
of send them on their way or whatever vocnoise and she did have the opportunity 
to come back iver uh erroronsheonce cutoffththe vocnoise she was through with her pregnancy but 
she did end up just going to a public school iver laugh vocnoise kind of 
yeah vocnoise um vocnoise laughactuallywith this case i do know what happened to the father 
i think he ended up moving to colorado laugh um iver no nothing at all 
vocnoise it it was known that he was the father vocnoise like i said i 
mean sil he laugh vocnoise he was kind of vocnoise uh vocnoise just laughoneofthose kids 
vocnoise and sil i mean he didnt listen to anyone or anything and vocnoise he 
ended up vocnoise like running away from home basically and like i said going out 
to colorado vocnoise and like on his drive down there his car broke down and 
his parents like wired him money vocnoise for him to get a plane ticket to 
come back and he ended up just taking the money fixing his car with it 
and cutoffkepkept sil kept on going iver so i mean he was just vocnoise one 
of those people i guess i mean there was really no hope for iver um 
sil i probably would vocnoise like i said just mainly more for the education standpoint 
of it iver um not necessarily the catholic beliefs iver or anything like that i 
mean vocnoise thats vocnoise something that vocnoise i dont know id sorta vocnoise make known 
to them sil but not something that id vocnoise really push on them iver um 
sort of let them make their own decision when they got older what they wanted 
to do vocnoise where they wanted to go with it iver vocnoise um vocnoise well 
as far as my mom goes shes vocnoise real into the catholic faith and i 
mean she made me vocnoise always go to church and things like that iver and 
i think thats probably why i feel the way i do now iver why i 
wouldnt push it on them vocnoise cause thats almost made me be resentful towards being 
catholic just the fact that i had it forced on me iver for vocnoise about 
seventeen or eighteen years vocnoise and just reached the point where id vocnoise had enough 
of it and i mean i didnt want vocnoise anything about it iver and i 
mean thats not to say that sil i dont sil like being catholic or whatever 
iver it doesnt so much bother me its just having it forced on me vocnoise 
like i said just sort of gives me a different opinion of it iver vocnoise 
and sil the real vocnoise meaning behind it so iver vocnoise nope vocnoise iver she 
does know that i dont go to church iver um iver she vocnoise doesnt so 
much mind anymore vocnoise i mean since ive vocnoise turned sil eighteen vocnoise i mean 
ever since then its been no vocnoise problem or anything i mean shes sort of 
let me have my own opinion iver but i mean i honestly do think id 
at least go to church on occasion if vocnoise it wasnt forced on me sil 
vocnoise i mean it just got sort of cutoffriridiculous vocnoise just vocnoise to the point 
of being laughridiculous vocnoise extgoing vocnoise seventeen eighteen years vocnoise every single week iver of 
the year i mean vocnoise it just got to the point where vocnoise id had 
enough and vocnoise i didnt wanna laughgoanymore iver um vocnoise extmy both of them are 
older vocnoise my extsisters like twenty seven twenty eight and my brothers twenty four iver 
um vocnoise they have started again recently vocnoise uh they sort of hit the same 
point where vocnoise theyd just had enough of it too and stopped iver um but 
sil recently they are vocnoise getting into going to church vocnoise um iver um neither 
one of thems married or has kids vocnoise uh vocnoise my extsister vocnoise does errorhasvhave 
boyfriend for um vocnoise probably like three years or so vocnoise and there is talk 
about them sil like marriage and kids and stuff like that with them iver um 
like theyre living together things like that iver um vocnoise as far as my brother 
goes vocnoise laughicant say i laughreally see my brother too often vocnoise um he does 
live in town vocnoise um but sil usually hes sil either at work because he 
works fulltime then he has vocnoise hes a part time student columbus state vocnoise um 
vocnoise so i dont really see him during the day and then vocnoise at night 
he usually goes out does his thing i go out and do my thing vocnoise 
so i mean as far as whats going on with him vocnoise i really dont 
know but cutoffiit i know i mean theres nothing vocnoise real serious laughgoingon with him 
or anything like that sil iver um vocnoise not really vocnoise he vocnoise i mean 
sil he vocnoise obviously laughwent to church too vocnoise for sil at least a few 
years vocnoise um vocnoise while they were vocnoise my parents were still together vocnoise but 
sil i mean since then i mean theres really vocnoise sil nothing about him iver 
vocnoise not really i mean vocnoise she vocnoise i dont laughknow my moms kind of 
weird like that she vocnoise she more believes in the religion aspects of it sil 
not so much as what the catholics believe about it vocnoise um vocnoise like their 
views on outside of religious matters iver um she just more erroragreedsagrees cutofftowartowards vocnoise with 
their vocnoise views of god or what not iver as opposed to what the catholic 
church actually thinks is correct and iver what should be done iver yeah iver yeah 
iver um vocnoise probably wouldve been about six years ago vocnoise id been in vocnoise 
sixth or seventh grade iver yeah i lived with my mom since then iver uh 
my dad is remarried iver um vocnoise exthes sil probably been married for vocnoise four 
or five years iver shes pretty nice i mean vocnoise shes vocnoise definitely at least 
standable and iver acceptable so iver laugh vocnoise iver umhum iver yeah iver um vocnoise 
yes and no vocnoise like i said i think the average person vocnoise is pretty 
decent person i mean i dont think that vocnoise theres vocnoise anything violent or that 
vocnoise laughtheres anything wrong with them vocnoise sil but at the same time vocnoise its 
just the media focuses on the ones that are out of control and makes a 
big deals of vocnoise the ones that are out of control vocnoise and i think 
that sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they dont 
vocnoise they dont show about like when people are helping people out or things like 
that when the local high schools vocnoise like volunteering at vocnoise like the local senior 
citizens home or something like that iver instead they pick up on oh so and 
so was arrested for drug dealing today he vocnoise you know vocnoise so and so 
age and vocnoise they sort of give background on him and thats sil what everyone 
bases their view on vocnoise it seems to be is that everyone turns to the 
media to see whats going on vocnoise when the medias only showing one side of 
the story i mean theres definitely much more out there vocnoise thats going on than 
theyre vocnoise telling you vocnoise um vocnoise so i really dont see a big sil 
problem with vocnoise the way vocnoise the vocnoise americas going or whatever the youth vocnoise 
um vocnoise and like say i wouldnt say its any vocnoise laughworse than any past 
generations vocnoise i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like 
that are being around vocnoise but vocnoise simply the reason being was because in past 
generations they werent around for it iver um i mean vocnoise there were things out 
but theres nothing like what they have today you know the small little hand guns 
and things like that theyre real easy vocnoise carryable and concealable i mean sil like 
you know back in the sixties stuff like that i mean they had switchblades things 
laughlikethat yeah i mean vocnoise i mean theres really nothing vocnoise too different iver exactly 
iver yeah iver sil um sil i sort of agree with the fact that sil 
if someone wants a gun theyll get a gun vocnoise it doesnt matter what they 
do to try to make it sil so people cant get their hands on guns 
vocnoise theyre basically always gonna be around and people are always gonna get them if 
they want them iver i think more what they need to do is sil in 
strict sil or vocnoise uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns 
or that are involved in shootings and things like that vocnoise um vocnoise because i 
mean for the most part vocnoise i mean people really dont get vocnoise too badly 
punished for things vocnoise i mean if you look in other countries i mean vocnoise 
like people vocnoise like the vocnoise asian countries places like that i mean they have 
really strict laws vocnoise i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism youre 
still serving jail time and you get laugh you get pretty badly punished for it 
vocnoise i mean some cases theyll even sil chain you up and beat you in 
public for it vocnoise um vocnoise i think vocnoise not to sound too vengeful but 
i think if more things went that way vocnoise that thered be a much less 
problem with it vocnoise um i think just the fact that the jails are so 
over crowded now that they know that theyre gonna get good time and parole and 
all sorts of stuff vocnoise that if you shoot someone youre vocnoise youre not even 
gonna get thirty days in jail and vocnoise youre gonna be vocnoise let go i 
mean thats an awfully small price to pay for iver just carrying around a gun 
and shooting someone iver umhum iver laugh iver yeah iver yeah iver um vocnoise i 
dont really know honestly i mean vocnoise its definitely careless nature and definitely something has 
to be done to em iver but at the same time its not like they 
had the intent sil to do it vocnoise so i cant say anything too incredibly 
severe vocnoise um sil but i mean i almost think it should be noise considered 
basically sil child neglect things like that um vocnoise basically the same penalties that youd 
run into for that vocnoise um vocnoise but vocnoise i mean unknown they obviously do 
need to make it more severe because obviously your kids vocnoise has the opportunity to 
kill themselves with a gun iver but vocnoise i mean thats just vocnoise sort of 
the curious nature of kids i mean they vocnoise obviously theyre gonna vocnoise get into 
stuff and things like that and i mean its not always the vocnoise parents fault 
i mean vocnoise i cutoffknknow there are a lot of people i mean vocnoise i 
think just in the news a few weeks ago they vocnoise had a shooting that 
happened couple of years ago and they just came to a verdict on it vocnoise 
and the parent like left in a cutoffttop top drawer of a tool shed that 
was locked vocnoise and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on 
the ladder unlocked it and he ended up shooting himself with it vocnoise i mean 
as far as that goes i mean theres really nothing more he could do i 
mean iver yeah i mean iver its just out of your control and i mean 
like i said i mean thats sil sort of kids for you i mean they 
just vocnoise obviously theyre gonna be curious about things vocnoise and vocnoise the parent definitely 
does have to be held responsible for it vocnoise but i dont know cutoffwwhat to 
what degree vocnoise that they should go with it iver nothing serious no iver um 
vocnoise not really i mean vocnoise ive been with a few people that have sil 
just noise i mean just vocnoise randomly gotten kind of jumped i mean they didnt 
steal anything they just vocnoise beat them up for no reason or what not iver 
but i mean its was nothing too serious or violent i mean iver they didnt 
like pull out any weapon or anything like that it was just a fistfight yeah 
iver happened sometime sil um vocnoise probably wouldve been my cutoffow sil my freshman year 
in high school vocnoise um we were just vocnoise walking down high street and laugh 
i guess we were vocnoise wrong place at the wrong time and vocnoise some people 
vocnoise were like yelling stuff vocnoise and we couldnt make out what they were saying 
iver and one of my friends was like whatd you say vocnoise and he took 
that as like a threat or something like walked over iver and just laughstarted picking 
a fight with him iver just iver to beat him up vocnoise but iver laugh 
iver um iver they probably wouldve been vocnoise um about seniors in high school or 
so iver juniors or seniors in high school i mean it wasnt anything too vocnoise 
serious it was just more vocnoise i guess a testosterone trip or something vocnoise iver 
oh unknown definitely yeah like i said unknown parts no different iver uh iver um 
vocnoise its probably would be worse vocnoise i mean actually vocnoise just wait for my 
last experiments i heard couple people talking about it they were talking about it iver 
yeah vocnoise um vocnoise and sil i can say vocnoise there are some drugs that 
sil i dont really consider to be too threatening or vocnoise that im really too 
worried about people using vocnoise um vocnoise like i mean just the whole idea with 
marijuana things like that i mean sil it doesnt really vocnoise bother me so much 
i mean vocnoise cigarettes and alcohol basically do the same thing it does iver and 
i mean those are legal vocnoise obviously vocnoise um vocnoise obviously things like once you 
start getting into cocaine p c p things like that those are a little bit 
more serious iver and vocnoise obviously a lot more dangerous and vocnoise i definitely think 
that there is a bigger problem with vocnoise the bigger drugs vocnoise once you get 
it to like college or whatever iver as back into cutoffgrgrade into high school iver 
um iver ive been to parties and things like that where people were shooting up 
with like heroin and things like that vocnoise um iver and vocnoise i mean thats 
vocnoise pretty vocnoise i dont know extreme yeah vocnoise um vocnoise so i mean its 
definitely i would say this more serious drugs are definitely iver much more widely used 
once you get into college vocnoise um but i mean as far as like the 
pot and just things like that i mean i cant say i see any difference 
between iver here and high school vocnoise ecstasy is the drug ive been hearing about 
vocnoise a laugh a lot the past sil like year or two and its definitely 
something thats grown iver just like almost out of control iver um vocnoise its pretty 
vocnoise dangerous drug i would say for the most part vocnoise um not so much 
vocnoise the getting high part of it but just what goes into it iver uh 
like i know one of the vocnoise poisons used in it is like rat poison 
or something like that vocnoise i mean just obviously the idea of putting rat poison 
into you when its meant to kill a rat vocnoise obviously seems pretty dangerous iver 
umhum iver yeah iver yeah iver laugh iver yeah iver um iver ecstasy yes vocnoise 
there are a few people that i know that vocnoise use it iver like on 
a fairly regular basis even iver um vocnoise i mean nothings happened to them and 
vocnoise i mean like i said vocnoise the high getting high part of it vocnoise 
isnt so much of the problem its just what goes into it iver um so 
i mean basically vocnoise my opinion on that is just leave it up to them 
vocnoise i mean if they wanna take the risks obviously they know laugh iver the 
risks and what goes into it vocnoise and like i said i mean it doesnt 
really hurt anyone the high part of it iver um i mean basically all they 
do is sit on the couch and laugh and smile and laugh at basically anything 
thats said for four or five hours iver and i mean thats about it but 
vocnoise no i mean vocnoiseitsnothingcrazy where they vocnoisethinktheyre god and iver hesum iver yeah one 
of extmy sil uh sil friends cousins went vocnoiseto that fraternity sil noise um vocnoise 
exti sil dont remember what the cause was of his vocnoisedeath sil um sil but 
i mean like said i mean that definitely vocnoiseits a dangerous drug to be using 
vocnoise and sil i mean not vocnoisetosay that they should vocnoiselegalize it or vocnoiseanything i 
mean obviously sil thats pretty extreme to do vocnoise hesbut sil like i vocnoisesaid i 
mean its something extmore to where vocnoisepeople should know the risks of it vocnoise and 
know what goes vocnoiseinto it vocnoise i mean its sorta like if you saw extsomething 
sil laying on the street and you vocnoisedecidedto sil eat it or whatever iver i 
hesmean sil you dont know vocnoiseanything behind it or whats going into it why would 
you do something like vocnoisethat iver um sil if youre going to do something like

sil i think its like vocnoiseswitzerland or somewhere like vocnoisethat where theyve legalized extdrugs vocnoise 
and they basically do it government vocnoisebased vocnoise where vocnoisethe government sil actually gives them 
out sil and the government gets the money for it vocnoise um sil i can 
almost see that as extbeing sil almost a good idea exthere vocnoise i mean obviously

i cant say thatd really bother me vocnoise like i said i mean extits something 
thats his choice his opinion what not vocnoise hesand sil noise sil i mean its 
up to him it doesnt sil affect the vocnoisenation extany hesor vocnoise vocnoiseanything like vocnoisethat 
i mean hes still vocnoise long hes making the right decisions or whatever vocnoise hesthen 
iver yeah i mean i cant say that they sil be any difference with them 
iver hesum vocnoise they did extbriefly like cover vocnoisethingslikethatwith like vocnoise religion and vocnoisehealth classes 
things vocnoiselikethat iver um vocnoise i mean they didnt really do vocnoiseanything too extensive on 
it they noisebasically as far as religion classes go they basically told what vocnoisethecatholic church 
believed about it vocnoise hesand how they felt about it but i noisemean they didnt 
extreally extcondemn hesor sil support it or vocnoiseanything like vocnoisethat i mean extthey sil they 
vocnoisebasically did realize that its hesmore sil up to the person i mean iver vocnoiseto 
the most part yeah i mean vocnoiseobviously like vocnoisetheysaid they vocnoisecame out and said vocnoisethecatholic 
extchurch sil was extagainst sil it sil but at the same vocnoisetime vocnoise like with 
the research things like that extwhere sil theyre saying that it could be a mental 
disorder of some vocnoisesorts vocnoise extwhere i extmean sil they couldnt vocnoisecantso much really condemn 
it sil vocnoiseto sil to the point anymore vocnoise that vocnoisethey used vocnoiseto iver um 
iver a few vocnoisetimes that they did cutoffex sil specifically extsay vocnoise um homosexuality sil 
but sil i mean there were other vocnoisethings that vocnoisetheyd cover vocnoise i mean vocnoiseits 
not like it was vocnoisejust an vocnoise all out vocnoiseassault on being gay or vocnoiseanythinglikethat 
vocnoise iver hesum sil i really did not no iver hesum sil college wise i 
dont hesknow noise sil anyone of college vocnoise age vocnoisethats gay iver i do know 
a few extpeople sil that are extgay vocnoise um sil but exttheyre vocnoise in their 
thirties iver or so iver hesum sil they extwere people i met through friends sil 
um sil extactually vocnoise unknown one of my extfriends parents sil had a friend that 
was extgay vocnoise um and sil just be over there whatever sil i mean i 
cant say vocnoise laughiseeany big difference between iver gay people or sil straight people so 
iver umhum iver yeah iver vocnoise hesum vocnoise i would vocnoisesay sil it doesnt laughreallymatter 
either way honestly vocnoise i extmean vocnoise vocnoisefact of the matter is they extare so 
deal vocnoisewith it i extmean sil get over it i mean vocnoise obviously its not 
something new thats sil been coming laugharound i mean its obviously been around for a 
long time iver and sil i mean sil yeah if they find the cause of 
it whatever you know thats good but sil at the same time it noise the 
cause of it doesnt really matter vocnoise i mean the fact of matter is its 
there they have to deal with it so iver laugh iver if they vocnoise had 
a way to cure it then fine sil but vocnoise leave that up to the 
people iver dont say oh well vocnoise your sons gonna be gay hes two right 
now lets vocnoise you know vocnoise change this so it vocnoise so it doesnt come 
out to be a problem or whatever vocnoise but sil i mean i think they 
need to leave that to the decision of the people iver i mean obviously vocnoise 
if laughsomeones vocnoise like thirty and theyre gay i dont sil see them as being 
too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time vocnoise iver 
um vocnoise honestly sil i cant say it really bothers me too much vocnoise um 
vocnoise i mean as far as vocnoise just dealing with vocnoise gay people or whatever 
vocnoise it sil doesnt bother me at all vocnoise its just something vocnoise i dont 
wanna vocnoise deal with or whatnot vocnoise um so i mean vocnoise the fact that 
vocnoise i mean two vocnoise people of the same sex are living together married or 
whatnot vocnoise that doesnt bother me vocnoise like i said its just more something that 
vocnoise i dont know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something 
if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot vocnoise its vocnoise i think 
its just more because its so cutoffweiweird vocnoise different than vocnoise like what you laughnormallyseeor 
things like that iver but at the same time i mean i dont laugh dislike 
them or anything for it i mean noiseits vocnoise its their choice i mean sil 
fact of the matter is it doesnt have any vocnoise effect or vocnoise anything on 
my life so iver i dont know thats kind of a vocnoise tricky question really 
vocnoise because on one hand sil obviously the kid sil definitely laughwill get vocnoise uh 
vocnoise made fun of and teased and things like that iver during school vocnoise but 
at the same time vocnoise i mean as long as vocnoise the laughparents love the 
kids it doesnt really matter what sex they are and they treat them well vocnoise 
um vocnoise so i mean thats kind of a tough question vocnoise to answer i 
mean its almost vocnoise its something that they almost need to ask the kids but 
obviously sil at the age that theyd be adopting um they vocnoise obviously wouldnt know 
vocnoise how to answer that question yeah iver laugh iver laugh iver um vocnoise i 
can see where vocnoise the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them 
into vocnoise gay people or whatever vocnoise um just because obviously vocnoise you basically mimic 
your parents as far as noise what you do when youre young and vocnoise things 
like that sil and obviously laughifyouso vocnoise had two vocnoise male parents or whatever vocnoise 
obviously you might be thinking laugh more towards vocnoise like dating guys and things like 
that vocnoise um vocnoise i dont know if thatd be really a problem though i 
mean i dont know if that would vocnoise honestly happen iver um sil i mean 
extfact of the matter is if being gay is sil a genetic disorder vocnoise then 
that should have no effect sil on the kids because sil they should still be 
vocnoise i vocnoise normal i guess or heswhatever vocnoise you want to say iver um 
vocnoise as far as vocnoise being heterosexual vocnoise so i mean i really cant say 
that id see that affecting the kids iver sexuality at all iver umhum sil iver 
that wouldnt bother me at all iver um vocnoise i cant say thatd vocnoise really 
bother me too much i mean its laughthesame thing as vocnoise having vocnoise a woman 
gym teacher or whatever iver um vocnoise i mean fact of the matter is sil 
a lot of people out there vocnoise i guess vocnoise could be child molesters or 
whatever i mean it laughdoesntmatter if theyre straight or gay or vocnoise whatever vocnoise the 
fact of the matter is i mean theyre sil theyre out there iver and anyone 
you come across could be laugh vocnoise getting vocnoise i dont know i guess vocnoise 
weird ideas of your kids or whatever iver i was in the cub scouts iver 
so that was like noise through like sixth or seventh grade or something like that 
noiseyeah iver yeah iver um vocnoise i dont think that really matters honestly vocnoise um 
vocnoise laughimeanits vocnoise i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts youre 
usually vocnoise eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up vocnoise and 
i think by laughthat time sil most kids have at least a general idea of 
who they are vocnoise and what they laughlike and dont like vocnoise um i cant 
see sil i cant see them actually looking at like vocnoise uh their vocnoise leader 
or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore vocnoise um i 
mean obviously it should be someone that they noiserespect vocnoise but i cant say that 
theyd be like oh well he does it so vocnoise im gonna have to do 
it too or whatever iver um hum iver yeah iver umhum iver really iver i 
cutoffddidnt iver didnt hear about that iver um sil i would agree that i extthink 
vocnoise regardless of your race you should be able to adopt sil a child i 
mean vocnoise just extbecause vocnoise youre a black kid living with like a white family 
doesnt mean vocnoise you cant still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of 
vocnoise i mean its the same laughthing with like sil irish people adopting like italian 
babies or something like that i mean its no different vocnoise i mean sil as 
long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i 
cant see it being a problem of any sorts vocnoise um i mean just as 
long as they have someone that sil cares for the kid and vocnoise does stuff 
for them i mean sil i cant see it being any iver um vocnoise there 
werent a lot but uh there were definitely sil some there at least i mean 
iver um sil eh about the same number iver umhum iver laugh iver yeah iver 
sil i think sil people are still fairly racist i dont think its near as 
bad as it was but at the same time sil i mean i cant say 
i blame the white community so much for it sil i would say its probably 
both sil the white and sil i guess sil any other race relations fault vocnoise 
um sil i mean as far as like if you look at the black communities 
things like that vocnoise you have like b e t sil um sil you have 
like the united negro college fund things like that sil where sil theyre almost segregating 
themselves by having these organizations sil because theyre geared specifically towards black people sil and 
sil i think in a way thats almost segregating themselves from the rest of the 
community sil because theyre not giving out equal opportunity to the people that need em 
sil um its sort of like the same thing white people were doing sil you 
know thirty forty years ago sil where that they had theyre vocnoise white organizations or 
what not sil um and i think its sort of going along the same lines 
where sil there is still a problem of it but sil i think it has 
gotten better at least sil if nothing else iver um iver i think iver i 
think for the most part people could handle it sil um vocnoise obviously i think 
probably more vocnoise sil the sil older generations would be the ones that would have 
the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole sil 
black rights movements and things like that vocnoise um i could see them having a 
problem with it but i mean more sil like sil more the generations of today 
or whatever sil like basically anyone under the age of about sil forty or fifty 
or so vocnoise i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i 
dont think it caused any sil huge problems or anything like that iver uh yeah 
sil um sil yes sil and no theyre kind of weird sil like sil that 
um sil one set of grandparents sil really i cant hear ever says anything sil 
theres a set on the other side that sil they are sil a little bit 
more racist sil um sil but at the same sil time sil it i sil 
dont know they almost set up like a double standard sil for black sil people 
sil there are black people that they really like and i mean theyre actually friends 
with some black people and there are black people that they dont like for whatever 
the reason may be sil and sil those are the people that theyre racist towards 
sil i mean its the same thing that goes with sil white people obviously there 
are white you can stand theyre white people that are just sil obnoxious and you 
dont wanna deal with sil um i mean its basically the same sil thing sil 
right sil yeah sil yeah sil yeah sil yeah exactly sil um sil i really 
dont think we do for the most part sil i cant say i sil see 
any sil real big problems or anything like that sil that occur just sil because 
of sil the sex sil you are or anything sil i think that probably wouldve 
caused a bigger problem than the black sil president sil um honestly sil um sil 
although i dont really sil see too sil many sexist sil problems i definitely do 
see sil guys still be more sil like the decision making sil type sil and 
as being like the final sil say in things vocnoise rather than women sil and 
i would see them sil having an authority figure sil thats being a woman sil 
as causing problems to em iver i think they would a bigger problem with it 
yeah iver um sil like i said itd just be the old generations with the 
sil black president vocnoise where now itd be sil part of all generations that would 
still have a problem with it and i think thatd be a bigger number iver 
then sil would be with a black president sil and i think it would cause 
problems vocnoise um i dont know if anything real violent or anything would occur from 
it sil but sil i definitely could see here vocnoise definitely vocnoise sil would think 
that people would be sil arguing about it yelling about it and sil making a 
bigger deal about it iver um vocnoise probably for the most part i mean sil 
as long as they laugh have a vocnoise political background of some sort i cant 
say i see any sil real difference sil i mean for the most part theyve 
proven to be able to do sil anything else any sil guy can do so 
iver umhum iver no vocnoise i sil not really laugh i mean vocnoise i dont 
think theyd come sil to any more difficult conclusions than guys had sil coming up 
to iver uh yeah sil no not sil at all sil no sil um honestly 
no sil im sil pretty shy for vocnoise the most sil part so sil those 
sil more types of women i cant say sil i sil really sil ever had 
a relation with or whatever sil unfortunately although i dont like it sil yeah sil 
i dont know i just sil im a pretty indecisive person i dont like making 
decisions sil and shes kind of the same way sil so when it comes to 
what were going to do or whatever it sil takes sil us hours to decide 
sil what were going to do and i mean it just gets us sil nowhere 
sil i mean even some place sil as simple as you know where to go 
out to eat or whatever well spend a good half hour forty sil five minutes 
just driving around till we actually decide a place or someone sil says something or 
sil whatever sil so iver whats that iver um i met her in high school 
sil shes still in high school and im in college sil so iver um sil 
yes and no sil i mean sil as far as sil the experience goes i 
mean i dont live on campus sil so i dont get the entire sil college 
experience you know sil the whole dorms and events going place on campus sil its 
more things about pick and choose that i wanna do on campus i come down 
for sil um so i cant really say its anything too drastic sil i mean 
obviously its kind of weird when sil people are asking what youre doing and youre 
like oh im going to sil you know high school prom laughor something vocnoise i 
have parts a little sil little awkward but i mean i cant say it sil 
its really any different or anything umhum sil umhum iver i sil honestly dont think 
that that really has much to do with it sil obviously it does sil put 
the idea in the kids heads sil but sil its been there for a long 
sil time iver um noise i mean obviously i mean thats how little boys are 
or whatever iver i mean obviously sil being vocnoise uh being a little boy i 
remember sil i mean just sil seeing even things like football or whatever i mean 
sil its youd see something you thought it was neat so youd do it or 
whatever iver i mean it goes back sil more towards the curious nature of sil 
kids sil where i mean i cant say theres anything really different whether vocnoise theyre 
play a video game where vocnoise theyre shooting people sil i cant say they sil 
see that as being something that affects them vocnoise iver once they turn into adulthood 
and sil they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i 
dont think that sil has anything to do with it iver no i mean sil 
like said i think little kids are cutoffrreally gonna be little kids if that stuff 
wasnt on tv theyre still gonna act the same way vocnoise theyre still gonna be 
sil walk around with toy guns things like that vocnoise playing war or whatever vocnoise 
iver um vocnoise i think its probably vocnoise some of both vocnoise i think its 
probably more vocnoise but sil i mean extobviously vocnoise sil they are gonna have different 
views on how things work vocnoise um vocnoise sil but i mean for the most 
part sil i cant see that as sil being too big of a problem vocnoise 
um sil vocnoise obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like 
that then there are women vocnoise but at the same time sil i wouldnt say 
theres anything too sil over powerful as fars the sil the number of guys being 
out there vocnoise are violent i mean its something sil that sil unfortunately does happen 
but i mean extits sil more how youre brought up whether you can control it 
or not vocnoise sil iver all right
