<SIL> <NOISE> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <SIL> i'm <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-I've> lived in columbus my entire life thirty four years <VOCNOISE> um born and raised on the west side of columbus <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> um i'm a um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's kind of a unique position <HES-I> i guess i'm a um <SIL> my <VOCNOISE> job title is a senior research associate <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i received my um bachelors masters p h d and nurse practitioner all from here from o s u <VOCNOISE> and i'm working down at dodd hall in a research position i'm also a nurse practitioner down there that <SIL> um <SIL> sees patients in follow up and in clinic <VOCNOISE> um they sort of created the position for me <VOCNOISE> about a year ago after i had my little boy <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> working on three different <SIL> um <SIL> research projects with three different physicians <VOCNOISE> two are <CUTOFF-l=?> <SIL> um <SIL> specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at long term outcomes in people that have sustained traumatic brain injuries <VOCNOISE> the other one is a drug study <VOCNOISE> um looking at control of agitation <VOCNOISE> and the other one is a um spinal cord injury <VOCNOISE> research study <IVER>
it's <EXT-a> <VOCNOISE> no it's a uh <VOCNOISE> clinical study where we're seeing how treadmill training <VOCNOISE> effects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury <IVER>
so they're kind of spread out twenty five twenty five ten percent that's kind of how it's divided out <VOCNOISE> between the projects <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um <IVER>
a nurse practitioner has more authority i guess to diagnose and see patients <SIL> um the state of ohio is <VOCNOISE> i think the only state that has a given <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> nurse practitioners prescriptive authority where we can write our own prescriptions <VOCNOISE> so we can see patients do the physicals <VOCNOISE> we can <HES-uh> suggest medications i guess per se but then the physician has to come in confirm our findings and then he actually writes the prescriptions <IVER>
yes <VOCNOISE> and that's what i like <IVER>
correct <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
but <SIL> we're working on it we've gotta couple house bills in right now and <VOCNOISE> see how things go <IVER>
be exciting <IVER>
yes <IVER>
i love ohio state but i don't <HES-I> i guess from a career perspective they say it's not a good idea to get all your degrees from one place but <IVER>
i don't intend to ever leave here so <IVER>
i love <LAUGH-it> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
yes <IVER>
yes <VOCNOISE> i uh <SIL> um <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> lordy <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> grew up on the westside i went to <EXCLUDE-name> my husband went to <EXCLUDE-name> um <SIL> proximity wise is probably within a mile of each other we were kind of high school sweethearts and <VOCNOISE> the whole bit <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> his dad still lives in grove city my mom lives still <SIL> at our old family house there on the westside <VOCNOISE> and we moved <SIL> um <SIL> also on the westside probably couple miles from my mom <IVER>
no <IVER>
no <IVER>
no <IVER>
for me personally <SIL> um <SIL> family being close <SIL> uh both sides of the family are here <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> for me familiar <VOCNOISE> <HES-familiarity> i don't like a lot of change a lot of new things <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> for me <HES-uh> <SIL> i was involved in i i swam for o s u swimming an got real involved with the o s u sports an just the sporting programs an <VOCNOISE> i love ohio state football <SIL> so i i like the sports <VOCNOISE> there a lot of activities to do to now with my little boy <SIL> going to cosi and the zoo and <SIL> just knowing where things are and how to get around <IVER>
so family <SIL> um <SIL> familiarity and <SIL> um <SIL> just the community i think <SIL> crime <SIL> i think it's going <SIL> <EXT-up> and up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> traffic is <LAUGH-horrendous> <VOCNOISE> but the one <CUTOFF-d=to?> but i mean <VOCNOISE> you need to go through that <SIL> right now <SIL> because columbus is expanding so much that we need the <VOCNOISE> orange brailles <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> i guess the lack of publicity nationally i <VOCNOISE> i we don't have yknow like the national football teams and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now with the hockey coming i <HES-I> think were getting more recognition but <SIL> when people talk about columbus they then <SIL> i don't think they know <SIL> columbus ohio or columbus georgia or columbus <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> where <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
right <IVER>
<HES-I> have <IVER>
right <IVER>
i don't <SIL> know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing with <SIL> um <SIL> chief jackson and the whole um <SIL> mayoral candidates how they're getting in debates over that <VOCNOISE> an i know this is something new on top of that um <VOCNOISE> i know it was the front page on sunday's paper <VOCNOISE> i looked at it briefly um <VOCNOISE> i think there must be some truth to it i don't know <SIL> the extent <IVER>
oh it's possible but i can't imagine it would <SIL> <UNKNOWN-uh_I> <SIL> not knowing how big it's going to get i guess i can't imagine <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that it's going to <SIL> well it might make national news i just <IVER>
it was on national news <SIL> you see i'm <SIL> not that informed on that um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
there's so much negativity on the national news i don't know if that'll just be blended in or if people will <SIL> associate that with columbus <IVER>
right <IVER>
uh <IVER>
two and a half <IVER>
yes <IVER>
yes <IVER>
cosi's going to be opening up on the sixth um <SIL> looking forward to doing that we had a um <VOCNOISE> uh seasons pass to wyandotte lake spent a lot of time at the pools <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> different swim centers hunter <SIL> different rec centers the y programs are excellent even here at ohio state they've got the um <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> recreational sports on sunday afternoons where they can go <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> we go to the zoo a lot <SIL> libraries have story times reading hours those type of things <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> just <VOCNOISE> all kind of community things easter egg hunts at the rec centers <IVER>
um <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <SIL> up until <SIL> march he was at home with my aunt with family watching him in our home <VOCNOISE> an then my grandfather who's ninety five got <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> ill <SIL> and my aunt had to choose between <SIL> my son and my grandfather and <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> she's watching <SIL> actually my grandfather's doing quite well now but she <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> watched him so we <VOCNOISE> now have him <SIL> in a day care <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> in hilliard <IVER>
oh <SIL> definitely <LAUGH> <IVER>
definitely <IVER>
i think it was more just a family preference i i preferred family um 
<VOCNOISE> again with the news <VOCNOISE> reports with uh um different bombings and the <SIL> i think the jewish school <SIL> caught my attention <VOCNOISE> and now that he is in daycare <SIL> i mean we did a pretty good screening but you still always kind of <SIL> wonder what's going on <VOCNOISE> he's done quite well he's i mean he's learned how to use scissors how to color he's <VOCNOISE> socially learning how to play with other kids those were all things he wasn't <SIL> doing at home <SIL> potty training's been a big deal because all the other kids in class are doing it and <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yes <SIL> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he talks about biting even though he's never bit <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> there's one particular boy right now when <SIL> his family leaves he just has complete temper tantrums and he's tried that out a few times too <SIL> he's one you can leave and <VOCNOISE> it doesn't phase him he's very comfortable with other people but <VOCNOISE> like last month or so he's tried that a few times and i think he picked that up at day care <SIL> seeing the other kids do that <IVER>
<HES-it's> quite possible <VOCNOISE> but we <CUTOFF-pick=picked> <SIL> the day care that i thought was closest to <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> the one that was <LAUGH-open_that> had the closest values that we had <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> personally would like a church based program but uh there aren't <SIL> any <SIL> well there weren't any open when we were looking for one <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> we did have the option of going here to o s u to their day care <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it has a wonderful reputation an everybody that i've talked to that has had children there <SIL> is very pleased with the program <VOCNOISE> but what i didn't like was <SIL> so that if they weren't <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> imparting values on the children <VOCNOISE> they don't celebrate <SIL> any holidays at all <EXT-so> they just kind of ignore <VOCNOISE> everything <VOCNOISE> where <SIL> he is now i still like getting my mother's day card in <VOCNOISE> i mean they're doing trick or treat thing on thursday they're going door to door they get to dress up or <SIL> he wouldn't have gotten any of that <SIL> at o s u and there pros and cons to <VOCNOISE> to both of those but <IVER>
i guess almost at o s u i wish they would <VOCNOISE> celebrate every holiday so then they're exposed to <SIL> all of it instead of none of it <IVER>
right <IVER>
do kwaanza do chanukah do so that they can learn other cultures and the other values <SIL> but they just <SIL> don't <SIL> do any of them <IVER>
yes <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
i think it's important to know what the person's values an customs are and to support whatever it is an if <VOCNOISE> i mean we've done some wild things over there but i mean it's <VOCNOISE> i mean we've changed rooms around beds around positions of how <VOCNOISE> beds needed to be placed in order that they needed uh <VOCNOISE> face the north star or uh they needed to have <VOCNOISE> this thing above the bed or under the bed and <VOCNOISE> i mean if it's important for them to <SIL> have prayer then i think it's important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to <SIL> have whatever it is they need <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i don't think forcing prayer on somebody if they don't believe in it i don't think that's <SIL> the right thing to do but <IVER>
<SIL> i would have a hard time believing <LAUGH-that> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean if the person <SIL> knew <SIL> i would think if the person knew that people were praying for them at church and that was important to them and they <SIL> prayed and <IVER>
i i uh <SIL> i would find that hard to believe <LAUGH> <IVER>
personally <IVER>
i've heard some of them talk about it <IVER>
yes <IVER>
none of it i mean it's kind of the traditional light at the um <VOCNOISE> uh uh like a big tunnel with a bright light at the end or uh <VOCNOISE> they were floating above themselves looking down at themselves at the accident scene uh <SIL> um <SIL> seeing a dead relative <SIL> something like that <IVER>
i believe them <LAUGH> i do i i i <SIL> <EXT-it's> i mean it's a very personal <SIL> thing and if that's what they saw <VOCNOISE> most of my patients are head traumas so <VOCNOISE> they can come up with some pretty <VOCNOISE> wild stories but <SIL> those visions are usually pretty clear and <IVER>
i don't argue with em i don't debate it it's just like <SIL> it might <IVER>
no <SIL> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> no <IVER>
definitely and it really makes you aware of your own mortality i mean things you see every day i mean never know it can happen to anybody anytime <VOCNOISE> just like that accident yesterday with um <SIL> right <IVER>
i mean you just never know <SIL> how freaky <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> it's just weird <IVER>
right <IVER>
my father died when i was two so i think just being raised yknow by a single <SIL> parent <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> made you well aware of <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
yes <IVER>
uh his mother died um the week after we got married <VOCNOISE> she had diabetes um <SIL> uh juvenile diabetes diagnosed at age eleven and just <VOCNOISE> over the years um ended up having open heart surgery and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> didn't make it through the surgery <SIL> my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so <VOCNOISE> my perception of open heart surgery even though i'm a nurse <LAUGH> <LAUGH-is> not very good just because of <SIL> the two <IVER>
family experiences <IVER>
nothing's coming to mind <VOCNOISE> no <IVER>
oh wow <IVER>

<IVER>
no <SIL> every once in awhile with my grandmother <VOCNOISE> she <SIL> always wanted me to become a nurse and i was a senior in high school when she died and <VOCNOISE> sometimes i think boy <SIL> she really like it that i was a nurse <VOCNOISE> because i still use her bloodpressure cuff an everything she had given me her bloodpressure cuff i mean it's very old <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
<SIL> yes <IVER>
<SIL> no <IVER>
in germany <IVER>
<SIL> mm-hmm <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> during the depression my grandfather <SIL> um moved over here and then <SIL> asked her <IVER>
to marry him and she moved over and <IVER>
<SIL> they settled in springfield ohio and <VOCNOISE> then my mom <SIL> met my father <SIL> um <SIL> he was from pataskala they met here at o s u where they're going to college and <SIL> they settled here in columbus <IVER>
okay <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> small world <LAUGH> <IVER>
must have <IVER>
yes <IVER>
so i think <IVER>
that's what i <SIL> <NOISE> recall missing <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i know <VOCNOISE-Steve> <VOCNOISE> my <SIL> sometimes <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean <UNKNOWN> we've taken joey out to the cemetery a few times to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> go to the gravesite of his father and he says yknow very often <VOCNOISE> <SIL> boy she would really liked to have been here <SIL> and done things with him <SIL> <IVER>
he's an aeronautical engineer <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he started off here in columbus at janitrol they went out of business then he went to urbana <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for grimes aerospace <EXT-and> um they ended up merging in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now there's really no aerospace things in <SIL> columbus <EXT-Ohio> <EXT-so> he's working for <EXCLUDE-name> in plane city which is um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> kind heating and cooling air conditioning systems <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so he's using his airflow design <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not on airplanes but on <SIL> heating and cooling systems <IVER>
<EXT-yes> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
there's a huge wind tunnel yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i don't know if it's where it is but i definitely remember him talking about doing different experiments and projects in the tunnel <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-we> <EXT-well> <VOCNOISE> sort of and kind of yes we were i mean <VOCNOISE> <EXT-we> dated in high <EXT-school> but he ended up going to prom with somebody else and we <HES-I> mean <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> we went to <CUTOFF-ki=kindergaten> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> went kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom an his mom were campfire leaders together and the whole bit <VOCNOISE> and then we didn't really <EXT-date> <SIL> and um <SIL> <EXT-college> <VOCNOISE> kind of <SIL> really didn't get together at all freshman year <SIL> he did go <VOCNOISE> to school here <VOCNOISE> and then um <SIL> as i said i swam for ohio state and then i went into agler davidson a sporting goods store to um <VOCNOISE> buy a swimsuit <SIL> my sophomore year <VOCNOISE> and he was a cashier there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and we started <NOISE-talking> again and it was just like <SIL> we hadn't missed any time and started dating <IVER>
sophomore year again and ended up getting married after i finished my master's <IVER>
eighty eight <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so we <CUTOFF-ju=just> we just had our eleventh wedding anniversary <SIL> yeah <IVER>
i <EXT-can't> <LAUGH-imagine> <EXT-imagine> <LAUGH-not> <LAUGH-doing> it that way <VOCNOISE> i mean personally i i <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's so much <SIL> i know about him and things i trust because i've known <SIL> him forever <VOCNOISE> there's so many i don't think people are as honest and truthful <SIL> these days <SIL> i don't know <SIL> i would have a hard time really getting into a relationship with somebody <SIL> that i met today not <SIL> knowing everything about him <IVER>
<SIL> why do i think that is um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i would say family <VOCNOISE> values customs traditions um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> divorce moving <VOCNOISE> just looking at my sister my my sister <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <SIL> she's very happily married but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my god i mean they <SIL> they lived here in columbus he's from dallas <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they met here <SIL> they moved to indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now they're in london england they've been married what four five years <VOCNOISE> and i think they've lived six different places <VOCNOISE> they're just constantly on the <EXT-move> they just don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> have the connection with the family <EXT-and> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i don't know if that's a bad thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they aren't <IVER>
<SIL> right and and you aren't <SIL> as close to your family and <VOCNOISE> the traditions and the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think you lose all of that and then you get so wrapped up in work and moving that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't think kids have the center base to the family that they used to have and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <SIL> the the culture is just so fast paced that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't <NOISE-think> <NOISE-people> are maybe it's not honesty maybe it's just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they don't have as <SIL> much time to get attached <EXT-and> they're ready to move on again you just don't get as close <SIL> to people as you used to <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i can <LAUGH-argue_both_sides> of that <VOCNOISE> i'm at a luxury i guess where we're at a position where <SIL> i i truly don't have to work so <VOCNOISE> if i ever felt that <SIL> he was in jeopardy or he wasn't getting what he wanted <SIL> or needed <SIL> i would <SIL> quit in a heartbeat to to <HES-to> take care of that but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> having family with him the first <SIL> year and a half <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know i got all my schooling everything out of the way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i cut down to the sixty percent when he was born to have more time with him <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i don't know it's a whole different society with emails and the <VOCNOISE> <EXT-uh> computer and the internet and <CUTOFF-ju=the> the cell phones i mean it's <VOCNOISE> in some <SIL> regards it's much more connected but <SIL> so impersonal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <SIL> mom's being outside the home <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think so many families are <SIL> forced to do that with the cost <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and is it the cost or is it the wants <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-it's> the very material society right now <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but it's also a very <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> good economical time too the stock market <VOCNOISE> <SIL> overall's been up i know it's down right now but overall <VOCNOISE> so the money's been flying <EXT-and> houses and buildings and <IVER>
right <SIL> i mean pal is <SIL> booming <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> personally i could not have put him in daycare when he was an infant and i think i would have quit if <SIL> a family <SIL> would not have been available but since family was available <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think he's very social i think he was ready for <SIL> the interaction with the other kids <SIL> and three days a week isn't <SIL> right <IVER>
right <SIL> my husband drops him off and i pick him up so he's there for the shortest amount of time <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <EXT-oh> <LAUGH> <IVER>
it's probably family by family i mean that we <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> that's why i was a little bit late leaving <VOCNOISE> <SIL> work the way it was there <CUTOFF-the=they're> we've got two <SIL> coworkers one <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um has her child at <HES-the> same day care as as myself she's about a year now and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and listening to her and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <SIL> she's there you know sixty seventy hours a week <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> she <SIL> dropped off at six a m and not picked up till six thirty p m and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she's fine with that <SIL> me personally <SIL> there's no way because somebody is totally <SIL> in my opinion <SIL> raising that child you aren't getting to put your values your traditions <SIL> what's important to you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> onto that child <SIL> now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been in day care now for three weeks and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she's gonna go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she's she's gonna quit her job and go to um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> night working nights three days a week <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because <SIL> it is important to her to <SIL> be at home with him <IVER>
um <SIL> hum 
<IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-right> <IVER>
it's awful <LAUGH> <IVER>
probably <VOCNOISE> i mean i just even notice <SIL> like road rage just in general like with myself <VOCNOISE> when i was working full time even with my child at home <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just the frustration of getting home i was so stressed with work <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and now being part time <IVER>
i'm so much more relaxed i mean <VOCNOISE> the pressures that these kids <VOCNOISE> these days have on them <VOCNOISE> and you're right without families at home to give them the guidance <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean at columbine if i'm not mistaken that was the one who had the journal who had <VOCNOISE> somebody had made bombs in the garage and <VOCNOISE> the family didn't know about it and i was like <VOCNOISE> how can a family not know that <VOCNOISE> but if they're so busy and working and trying to provide <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-sure> <IVER>
right <IVER>
wow <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know if there could be <VOCNOISE> there are certain programs different community based programs getting <VOCNOISE> but again those are my values as i say <VOCNOISE> steering the kids into <VOCNOISE> a church based program if they <VOCNOISE-can't> be there <VOCNOISE> putting them with um <SIL> families and friends that you know and trust to <CUTOFF-l=look> to look after them giving them <VOCNOISE> the guidance <VOCNOISE-they> need <VOCNOISE> the ymca programs are wonderful they give them <VOCNOISE> a structured activity to do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> where they're supervised <VOCNOISE> but again <VOCNOISE> <SIL> those programs a lot of times cost money that the families don't have and it may not be their values to put them <VOCNOISE> in those type of programs <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean that goes along with my <SIL> <VOCNOISE-customs> and beliefs i mean were going to send our child i already know to parochial schools there's no way i'm going to <VOCNOISE> send him to a public school <VOCNOISE> and even <VOCNOISE> my <VOCNOISE> my husband's a um <VOCNOISE> boy scout <SIL> um <SIL> leader <VOCNOISE> and just listening to the boys there <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-iy=he> <SIL> he <VOCNOISE> he did a program last night on <SIL> respect <IVER>
just <SIL> don't talk when other people are talking just <SIL> general <EXT-things> <VOCNOISE> that i <EXT-think> you should take <SIL> for granted <IVER>
that they just <SIL> don't <VOCNOISE> have those <SIL> <IVER>
they're just not getting it right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i want the discipline and i want the religion basis <IVER>
i want i don't want somebody <VOCNOISE> i i want them to be able to <VOCNOISE> feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> from our friends that have gone <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-the=they> with uh <CUTOFF-their> their discipline is expelling <VOCNOISE> the child from school <VOCNOISE> while they're expelling them <VOCNOISE> to a home <SIL> where the parents working <SIL> where they're just getting three days of free play <VOCNOISE> i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble <VOCNOISE> they really aren't <VOCNOISE> learning <SIL> from that <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
i do <IVER>
i went to public um <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-kindergarten> through sixth <SIL> and actually <SIL> i was quite pleased with the program but my mom also had me in um <VOCNOISE> i don't know it's ccd class it's a <CUTOFF-cath=catholic> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> it's uh monday nights you go and you get the <VOCNOISE> um basis of the of the church <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> that was important to me and then um <VOCNOISE> i went to <VOCNOISE> um parochial school for seventh and eighth grade which was <VOCNOISE> in my opinion horrendous <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> excuse me i think it's <SIL> the age <VOCNOISE> of the children in general yknow the whole <SIL> puberty thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and going into a new school where these kids had been together since kindergarten and trying to fit in at that age <VOCNOISE> and then i went to parochial <CUTOFF-sk=school> i went to <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> for highschool and that was a very good experience <IVER>
uh new <EXT-kid> the boyfriend <EXT-girlfriend> the <VOCNOISE> different things they were trying behind the building yknow it's just the boy girl i mean just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not <LAUGH-nice> <LAUGH> no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> very much so <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> i do think there's some <VOCNOISE> and i don't think they probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i don't think they probably be exposed to you know <VOCNOISE> the gay lesbian <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i think that would probably just be <SIL> blown over and <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-they> didn't go very much in depth you know about sex and your sex ed classes were pretty <VOCNOISE> but on the other hand for me that was fine i don't know <VOCNOISE> our friends it's have eleven year old that's going to public school <VOCNOISE> i mean he had <VOCNOISE> a <VOCNOISE-parenting> class already <VOCNOISE> where he had to carry around this baby he went we went to a hockey game with him <VOCNOISE> and here he is with this baby at this hockey game <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it was just like at eleven <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that's <SIL> awfully young <VOCNOISE> but again he's got this baby <VOCNOISE> yet they didn't talk about <VOCNOISE> how this baby <VOCNOISE> how you make a baby <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> everything <CUTOFF-assoc=associated> <SIL> and i don't know if they should be talking about that yet but here he is with this baby and it's just like <SIL> okay <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they do offer sex ed but it's <VOCNOISE> you know <SIL> very um <SIL> scientific in nature <VOCNOISE> and then we did have a um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> think it was actually in religion class where they paired you up you were a <SIL> couple and <VOCNOISE> you had to go through budgets and <VOCNOISE> chores and it was more that type of task <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
mm yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know that's so controversial i mean <VOCNOISE> i mean to the point i mean <SIL> they show them how to put condoms on bananas in public schools and it's like well <VOCNOISE> are you promoting sex then or <CUTOFF-shou=should> <VOCNOISE> do i <CUTOFF-pr=protect> uh <IVER>
you could argue both of those too but i <VOCNOISE> me personally i'd say that's just teaching them more than what they need to <LAUGH-know> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-I> <VOCNOISE> i think that's a little bit too much <IVER>
but then again i feel like sometimes i'm so naive <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a lot of that wasn't introduced yknow i was just like well <VOCNOISE> should i have known that <IVER>
i don't think it hurt me not knowing it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> 
um <SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i was very naive on that i mean <VOCNOISE> i mean you see it on the news and you but <SIL> the actual relationships <EXT-and> all uh but again do you need to know that unless it pertains to you and then even if it does pertain to you <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
i think uh <SIL> i didn't know the difference so it didn't affect me at all it's just <SIL> they're just another person <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think more uh as i'm being exposed to patients with the different lifestyles <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and knowing how to educate their caregivers and what they need <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i felt somewhat uh ill equipped the first few times but <SIL> um <SIL> knowing what the expectations are especially like with spinal cord injury patients and when you go into sexuality and teaching them <VOCNOISE> after injury <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean as a nurse you need to be able to <SIL> educate them <SIL> i felt pretty <LAUGH> <IVER>
inadequate <SIL> but the uh that was even through nursing school i mean those weren't things that were discussed <SIL> you go to special conferences to get <SIL> information on that <IVER>
that would be fine but again uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't <SIL> it's just another person with a different lifestyle it's like they're they're they're the same as me it's just <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i <SIL> think <SIL> they need to educate <SIL> me on what's important to them <VOCNOISE> and i'll <SIL> yknow <SIL> i'll honor and respect as much as i can <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> even people within different <SIL> i mean <SIL> a catholic isn't a catholic in my opinion i mean <VOCNOISE> there's some <SIL> old time <SIL> catholics i mean <SIL> like my mom <LAUGH> i mean that they just are very strict catholics <SIL> and abide by the <VOCNOISE> old rules before the vatican <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i think there's a new modern <SIL> age of catholics so even if you say <VOCNOISE> i'm jewish or i'm gay or i'm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> african american or whatever <VOCNOISE> i still think they're varying <SIL> they're still a person with different needs and wants and <VOCNOISE> what their traditions and culture and <SIL> family values are are still gonna be very different <VOCNOISE> and you need to find out from that individual person what it is <SIL> that they need <IVER>
no <LAUGH> <IVER>
uh oh yes <SIL> yes <IVER>
well just like premarital sex i mean there was no way i would ever discuss anything like that ever with her i mean that was just something that you didn't <IVER>
right you don't <IVER>
no no <SIL> no but <IVER>
okay <IVER>
should <SIL> be <LAUGH> but is it <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> taboo yeah <IVER>
sure <IVER>
sure <IVER>
it took us ten years to have <EXCLUDE-name> and i think my mom <SIL> genuinely thought i was doing birth control and we weren't but you always knew the subtle undertones undertones you <SIL> know is she or isn't she it was just like well i'm not gonna discuss it with her because i knew <SIL> that was a no no to her but <SIL> i wasn't but <SIL> she didn't need to know <LAUGH-that> <IVER>
it was right <IVER>
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well <SIL> it's my choice <SIL> oh god my husband's a lot better at these type of questions cause he was methodist and he chose to turn catholic when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was exposed to his it's like <SIL> boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser then mine and <LAUGH> just teaching him <SIL> to <SIL> be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> uh being there and open and keeping the lines of communication <SIL> open and <VOCNOISE> and then it goes back to the family being available and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> doing meaningful <SIL> things with the children <IVER>
that he didn't <IVER>
i'm gonna let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really don't care <SIL> what religion what he is i mean with my husband i really didn't care if he turned catholic or not <SIL> i do think religion is important <SIL> and whatever that religion is to him and that he has <SIL> a place to go to pray <VOCNOISE> to be with <SIL> his family <SIL> and other people <SIL> i think that's important if he wants to <SIL> be catholic great if he doesn't <SIL> that's okay too <IVER>
okay <IVER>
okay 
<IVER>
<SIL> that's number <CUTOFF-thr=three> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-mm_hmm> <LAUGH> <SIL> i have a very general uh opposition to this kind of thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh no matter where it is anymore <VOCNOISE> uh my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing <VOCNOISE> because i see <VOCNOISE> the uh <CUTOFF-th=the> total destruction of our center cities <VOCNOISE> uh and i say when i speak of center cities i don't necessarily mean just <SIL> cities the size of columbus <ERROR-wus=was+which> <ERROR-wizh=which> <ERROR-wus is the largest one in the state of ohio now <VOCNOISE> but i'm talking places like <VOCNOISE> washington courthouse which maybe have fifteen thousand <VOCNOISE> or um <VOCNOISE> uh wadsworth which maybe have eighteen thousand <VOCNOISE> uh this kinds of thing is being developed on the peripheral of the cities is just totally destroying those <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> a consequence i feel it's breaking our society down to the point where <VOCNOISE> we don't <SIL> don't know our neighbors at all anymore <VOCNOISE> the <UNKNOWN-f_feeling> uh it's quite common anymore that if you go three houses down <VOCNOISE> you have no idea who those folks are how they feel <VOCNOISE> what they might do for you or you can do for them <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and that all applies to the polaris question as i see it <VOCNOISE> and i think also that uh <CUTOFF-i=it's> it's a it's a very very major financial <VOCNOISE> uh gain for the developers who are doing that and it's going to <VOCNOISE> therefore harm <SIL> uh the many many areas <UNKNOWN-that> affected <VOCNOISE> <SIL> such as <VOCNOISE> north <SIL> <CUTOFF-n=north> <SIL> north north north north <LAUGH> <LAUGH-what's_the_name_of_the_shop> <VOCNOISE> uh north what <SIL> northland <CUTOFF-li=like> yeah northland i can't <LAUGH-even_say_the> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> okay <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> do i think they will <SIL> oh yes i think they definitely will i think there's so much heavy <VOCNOISE> uh political and financial <SIL> well i'm gonna reverse that statement uh there's so much heavy <VOCNOISE> financial <SIL> influence upon the political <VOCNOISE> uh influence that uh it it's almost a forgone conclusion <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and if it doesn't occur this <UNKNOWN> within this year <VOCNOISE> and uh there may be another vote in another year or next a next election <VOCNOISE> but i think that in fact it will go <IVER>
<SIL> i didn't quite <CUTOFF-understa=understand> <ERROR-hayer hear you <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
a little but not not nearly like she is <LAUGH-no_no> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> when you're fifty five or <SIL> or is it sixty two whatever age there's that age <VOCNOISE> limitation and or you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> based upon age or disability or being out of town <VOCNOISE> uh you're allowed <VOCNOISE> so but routinely we've <CUTOFF-do=done> <SIL> done the out <UNKNOWN-uh_of> i mean done the uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> absentee <VOCNOISE> over the years <VOCNOISE> no going back to basic politicians i i i think we have <CUTOFF-m=?> <SIL> uh i think the vast majority <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> are truly <SIL> good <SIL> honest people <VOCNOISE> they try to mean well <SIL> i'm <SIL> i'm concerned always <VOCNOISE> that uh people who go into politics are in fine shape when they start <VOCNOISE> but the tremendous influences are brought to bear <VOCNOISE> that they never <VOCNOISE> had had the opportunity to comprehend <VOCNOISE> before they got there <VOCNOISE> <EXT-and> they're just overwhelmed <SIL> it it and i don't necessarily think it's a <SIL> it's a <VOCNOISE> a dishonesty <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's like a tidal wave they get caught up and they can't resist the direction that's being put or they are being pushed 
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i just had a uh <CUTOFF-h=healthy> healthy vigorous <VOCNOISE> conversation last night <VOCNOISE> with a township trustee jersey township <VOCNOISE> which is just over in uh licking county <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> this gentleman <SIL> is <SIL> <EXT_eighty> three or four years of age and he's been the township trustee various times throughout his life <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> he <SIL> is very very concerned because of the exploding <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> back up <VOCNOISE> he's <VOCNOISE> a farmer has been a farmer <SIL> all of his life he owns about a hundred and fifty acres adjacent to <VOCNOISE> approximately a thousand which his son is <CUTOFF-perdo=predominantly> <SIL> mainly operating <UNKNOWN-I> <VOCNOISE> yet he goes out and works too <SIL> uh helps out at <CUTOFF-eight=eight(ty <SIL> at this age <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> but he is concerned because they've just recently passed an ordinance within the county <VOCNOISE> which allows <VOCNOISE> developers to come in and <SIL> already they are ready to take over a couple farms that are fairly close to him <UNKNOWN-but_I_mean> <VOCNOISE> but it affects the whole township <VOCNOISE> and one of the things that they <UNKNOWN> <SIL> left out as he put it <SIL> one of the ordinances that he <CUTOFF-hh=he> pushed and pushed and pushed <VOCNOISE> he wanted <SIL> a specific <SIL> part of that <SIL> ordinance to say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> every so many <SIL> people that move in to this area <VOCNOISE> you must provide for <SIL> a school <VOCNOISE> and he said <VOCNOISE> of <CUTOFF-consequen=consequence> and then he said they didn't do it <SIL> and he said i push and push and he said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i didn't know all the influence was on <VOCNOISE> on the side to get more houses get more houses because it was gonna produce more taxes <VOCNOISE> but <EXT-they> <SIL> he kept saying well what do you want these taxes for if you're not gonna provide for schools <SIL> so he was very concerned about that <VOCNOISE> so here was a case in my <CUTOFF-th=thinking?> opinion <VOCNOISE> a very very honest uh politician <VOCNOISE> but he was <SIL> also being <EXT-shoved> away <EXT-from> what he <SIL> felt was an honest approach <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
uh-huh <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
let me focus on <CUTOFF-wh=what?> you're question i'm not <EXT-sure> that <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> that she was answering what i thought <CUTOFF-y=you> <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> 
i appreciate your opinions <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but were you asking <SIL> did you have we seen a change in the politicians <VOCNOISE> and through our lifetime was that particularly your point <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> okay <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <UNKNOWN-i_don't=i_i_dn> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will <SIL> also be changing in the future <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> going all the way back uh finances uh <HES-were> were not a consideration in the in oh i'd say probably my first thirty maybe even forty years <VOCNOISE> there was some there was influence <VOCNOISE> but i think the influence was not financial <SIL> it was influence from <VOCNOISE> the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people <VOCNOISE> and sway them with his <VOCNOISE> and i want to use the word opinion but i know that's not right <SIL> it <SIL> he swayed them with <VOCNOISE> a position that he had developed <SIL> now that's not necessarily his opinion <VOCNOISE> so i'm trying to make a point there <LAUGH> <LAUGH-but> <VOCNOISE> he would sway them based upon <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> influences that he had <CUTOFF-h=had> <VOCNOISE> had <CUTOFF-other> <SIL> uh <SIL> uh various people within his community or <SIL> whether <VOCNOISE> whether you're talking about a township or a county state whatever <VOCNOISE> it may be <VOCNOISE> and yes <SIL> uh uh then <SIL> <CUTOFF-perhaps=per> <SIL> slowly <VOCNOISE> then i think the finances came into play <VOCNOISE> and finances have come to a <CUTOFF-h=horrible> <SIL> horrible <VOCNOISE> horrible situation as of today and i'll leave out this <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-thi=the> <VOCNOISE> the last two years it <UNKNOWN-has> because it's because <VOCNOISE> it's rather <CUTOFF-sh=specific?> <SIL> specific right now <VOCNOISE> but uh going back to two years or four years ago <SIL> finances were still a very very heavy consideration <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> not not just on the uh national level <SIL> but i'm seeing it even on local levels <VOCNOISE> i know within the immediate community there are people out there <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-t=tell hey come on we'll go to dinner we'll go do this and we'll do this and do this just uh just barely barely breaking <VOCNOISE> <EXT-uh> the barrier but not breaking the law <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> so yes <SIL> very definitely <SIL> progressively <SIL> has changed <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
which one of them <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
old blue eyes that's right <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> uh-huh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <SIL> <EXT-I> don't know that that's a cause uh a it <SIL> <EXT-they> they as a <EXT-group> uh <SIL> and this was kind of a happenstance it <CUTOFF-occ=occurred> <VOCNOISE> this occurred <VOCNOISE> as a result of a very major world war <VOCNOISE> uh so <SIL> in <CUTOFF-t=terms> <SIL> in terms of them causing it <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-thi=there+it> it was there was a happenstance and <VOCNOISE> and part of this mass communication we're talking about <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> began with them <VOCNOISE> and yes they are a major influence because we were talking about numbers and you're talking about uh <VOCNOISE> a <ERROR-grezha=greater> a greater <SIL> inter communication <VOCNOISE> i'd like to go back one step <SIL> where we're talking about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> when i made mention that three doors down you don't even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that <VOCNOISE> uh i think that's <EXT-profound> <VOCNOISE> as an <SIL> individual communication we are nearing zero <VOCNOISE> in terms of global mass communication to everybody <CUTOFF-wi=with> <VOCNOISE> inner personal communications that's the key in my opinion <VOCNOISE> personal versus inner personal communications <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-eh=and> <CUTOFF-and> and <SIL> it's zero over here and we're almost a hundred percent over here <VOCNOISE> but when we're in this inner personal or global or massive whichever term is the most appropriate <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> john doe who speak here <VOCNOISE> he hasn't the faintest idea who jane doe is over here <VOCNOISE> on the personal <VOCNOISE> it used to be <SIL> that yeah you knew who this person <ERROR-rize=right+was?> over here that's jane doe that lives in that third house <VOCNOISE> and she married henry jackson don't you remember old henry <VOCNOISE> well henry was the guy that lived way over there <VOCNOISE> on the other side of town <VOCNOISE> mass communications as it is today <SIL> they haven't the faintest idea of where jane came from or where henry jackson or where <VOCNOISE> old <CUTOFF-jh=jackson> <SIL> whoever <LAUGH-it_was_lived_over_there_i_said> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i think uh the <CUTOFF-th-think> i <CUTOFF-h=have?> i <EXT-think> you <CUTOFF-m=must?> need to distinguish between the personal inner personal <SIL> relationship <SIL> so maybe i digress too far there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> or who the next door neighbor is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> 
<IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> lassie <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think i could summarize <CUTOFF-m=most?> <SIL> uh just with a few words of what you're meaning to say i <CUTOFF-m=may> <SIL> may be wrong <VOCNOISE> but i think you're really meaning to say we must get back <SIL> to the family <VOCNOISE> there must be two parents <VOCNOISE> and they must <CUTOFF-b=be?> <SIL> recognize their children and <VOCNOISE> do like <SIL> you have just discussed <VOCNOISE> uh do with them the <CUTOFF-sa=same?> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> because today we are just drifting and drifting and drifting we uh <VOCNOISE> fifty percent of uh everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as i <SIL> understand the statistics today <VOCNOISE> and uh unfortunately it's still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this is going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> once again we are talking about communications too uh and the communications can be ill and they can be great <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh as she's touched upon <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh oh but i feel that pendulum has to swing back from <VOCNOISE> the non family we're headed toward or have been headed toward <VOCNOISE> and get back to a <CUTOFF-f=family?> very basic family orientation <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it's> <CUTOFF-i=it's> <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> abhorrent when i <VOCNOISE> hear <HES-that> uh <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> oh was it seven ladies who were quote <SIL> beautiful ladies are now willing to sell <EXT-their> <EXT-uh> sperm uh well that's not their sperm well whatever that is they sell <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> for ten thousand dollars apiece and to be implanted in the other <VOCNOISE> so that they can produce <CUTOFF-k=quote?> uh a quote beautiful child <VOCNOISE> well a beautiful child uh <SIL> and if <ERROR-your've=you've talking about just the physical features <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=is> <CUTOFF-i=is> is meaningless <SIL> it's what <SIL> is embodied in that body that's <SIL> can be beautiful <VOCNOISE> instead of just the physical features that you look at <VOCNOISE> and that to me is abhorrent such a such an <EXT-idea> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-j=just> and that <SIL> indeed is gonna take away from family i <CUTOFF-ca=can't> <VOCNOISE> in my way of <VOCNOISE> thinking i can't imagine <VOCNOISE> that i would uh <SIL> have my wife producing <VOCNOISE> somebody else's child over <LAUGH-here> and i'm going to have <VOCNOISE> the same <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-f=fatherly> <SIL> thank you that's <CUTOFF-exa=exactly?> fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward or with that child <IVER>
yes to but that uh <UNKNOWN> more that has primarily because of necessity <VOCNOISE> uh more often than not uh <SIL> uh maybe even today it's less than that <VOCNOISE> because it's a <CUTOFF-bee=been?> <SIL> because of a loss of a parent <ERROR-ther=the+or?> or inability of a <ERROR-prernt=parent> <VOCNOISE> uh or parents <VOCNOISE> uh being able <EXT-to> handle those children <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> yes <HES-those> those things do exist and they will always have some <SIL> but that's a very small percentage though scott <SIL> <VOCNOISE> 
<IVER>
that's about right that's about right <LAUGH> <SIL> think it's <ERROR-introvitral> <ERROR-introvitral> <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> well i see <SIL> i'm gonna have to fall way back and show my age again as most people would say <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-w=would> <SIL> i would really like to see <EXT-this> to happen but i also know that it most <CUTOFF-l=likely> <SIL> it'll never happen within the next three or four generations <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i <CUTOFF-st=still> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm of a <EXT-guy> who still believes that the lady has a place in her home <VOCNOISE> and i do not believe that we need <SIL> a man and wife out working and making <VOCNOISE> incomes as <SIL> everyone in the united states today feels they must <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> hazel hit upon it rather lightly a while ago and was talking about <VOCNOISE> need versus uh luxuries <UNKNOWN-well> i want i want i want <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> i uh my judgment is that we're spending today probably <SIL> eighty percent <VOCNOISE> of uh the income <SIL> on things that they <VOCNOISE> want <SIL> and only twenty percent on what they need and that's all they need to spend on that need <VOCNOISE> so therefore the <CUTOFF-nec=necessary> <VOCNOISE> pardon <IVER>
today's society does describe the need entirely differently than what i would <VOCNOISE> talking <SIL> talking to this gentleman last night we got back and we were comparing uh our <CUTOFF-n=?> <SIL> uh uh early life <VOCNOISE> uh we didn't even know what a nickel or a dime was uh those <CUTOFF-tha=that> that was unimportant and we also were talking about <VOCNOISE> how uh <SIL> how we uh went <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> he was telling me a little bit about it and i said <VOCNOISE> let me stop you paul i said paul <CUTOFF-wh=what> <SIL> what kind of shoes did you wear <VOCNOISE> uh in the summer <SIL> he said we didn't wear any shoes <SIL> aha <VOCNOISE> and then i told him how we didn't either i came from a very large family <VOCNOISE> uh mostly boys <VOCNOISE> we would uh <SIL> take our <ERROR-sho=shoes> shoes off as soon as the <CUTOFF-ear=earliest> <CUTOFF-ear=earliest> as we could in the springtime <VOCNOISE> we would <SIL> <UNKNOWN-g> uh store them in tallow in jars of tallow tallow is <VOCNOISE> uh lamb lard if <LAUGH-if_you_want_to_call_it_that> <VOCNOISE> and that was a preservative <VOCNOISE> and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as november this year it would've been november <VOCNOISE> we would take those shoes out and depending upon whose foot <SIL> fit those shoes those would the be the person who wore them <VOCNOISE> it wouldn't be <CUTOFF-th=the?> <CUTOFF-t=?> <UNKNOWN-the?> <VOCNOISE> the one who had worn them in the spring <VOCNOISE> cause he's growing in the meantime <VOCNOISE> and uh and it may go to another another <SIL> and i can remember we passed shoes down <VOCNOISE> as many as four of we children <VOCNOISE> now my dad also repaired shoes <SIL> he repaired shoes he cut our hair <VOCNOISE> well today that would be the most horrible thing is some of the kids that well i need me a pair <VOCNOISE> of <CUTOFF-kw=?> um i don't know whether you want <CUTOFF-ri=?> uh advertising on here or not but it's not <CUTOFF-a=advertising> <VOCNOISE> i i want a nike or i want a rocky or i want a guess <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> those that's pure luxury no needs at all but uh <VOCNOISE> today's society <VOCNOISE> 
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-those> are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> as i <ERROR-fink=think> you were implying <VOCNOISE> those are <EXT-needs> two those people <VOCNOISE> but they aren't <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> how do we correct some of this you've got to <CUTOFF-g=get?> i think we've got to cut out <SIL> a lot of this luxury <VOCNOISE> we've got to slowly bring quote that family back home <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and i don't necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man who cares <VOCNOISE> in today's work uh world far less agriculturally related <VOCNOISE> uh we're far more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation <VOCNOISE> uh so <VOCNOISE> uh a man and uh <SIL> uh <SIL> a <CUTOFF-ma=man> or a <CUTOFF-wom=woman> <ERROR-me=let> me <ERROR-frephrase=rephrase> a woman can do <SIL> most of the work that's being done outside of the home <VOCNOISE> today versus what they <SIL> could've done <VOCNOISE> as agricultural people <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and so once again though that would <EXT-bring> <SIL> <CUTOFF-b=back> <SIL> people back to this <SIL> central <NOISE> family <VOCNOISE> make up <NOISE> <SIL> this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> has to be <VOCNOISE> communications communications as it's going uh that it's <SIL> irreversible <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-a=and?> i think it can be redirected in much in the manner she's speaking uh <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> and where does this start i think it has start back here in first grade <VOCNOISE> i think parents must participate with teachers <VOCNOISE> uh as we used to <SIL> uh was just common uh you could walk in and sit down and uh watch the students or participate with participate and or <VOCNOISE> assist <SIL> uh well <EXT-today> <VOCNOISE> they have these <CUTOFF-ca=?> assistants <SIL> but they're hired <VOCNOISE> directed <VOCNOISE> assistants they're not in there <SIL> portraying or passing <VOCNOISE> their <SIL> <HES-own> their values of the community to the students <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh so i think that's <SIL> i <HES-I> guess i <CUTOFF-c=continue> <CUTOFF-mu=must?> i will continue to come back to family <SIL> to family almost everything has got to <CUTOFF-b=be?> come back to family <VOCNOISE> bring that family back together <VOCNOISE> and get them to communicate <SIL> on that <VOCNOISE> personal basis not that impersonal basis <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
very very much so now <CUTOFF-f=fifty?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-f=fifty?> twenty <SIL> fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would call we would tag <VOCNOISE> that description <VOCNOISE> rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> in the manner we <CUTOFF-dis=describe?> define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we're <CUTOFF-n=no> <VOCNOISE> no longer a <ERROR-CUTOFF-duma=democratic> democratic government <VOCNOISE> as defined back there then uh <VOCNOISE> yeah we're still democratic according to our new definition of this <VOCNOISE> developed over time <VOCNOISE> uh but it's <VOCNOISE> far more socialistic <VOCNOISE> uh but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah that's right when you're that was your question are we gonna have doom we're gonna have a catastrophe we gonna get this thing turned around before we have <VOCNOISE> yes <SIL> uh i think we will <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh but i don't <SIL> think we're ready to turn around yet i think we're still <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four five times i <CUTOFF-th=think> <SIL> uh it it is coming upon <EXT-us> <EXT-so> rapidly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-w=well> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> strongly predict <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that in just <SIL> twenty years <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and possibly ten <VOCNOISE> <SIL> each and every one of us in the world are gonna be interconnected with one another <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but once again its an impersonal <SIL> uh inner connection <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i can i'll be able to contact you when you're over in paris and i'll be over <CUTOFF-ih=in> in in <UNKNOWN-Octey> ohio and out there on the farm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i am probably watching the geese swimming up and down the little lake <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you're sitting over there in paris having a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> coffee something something <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah it <LAUGH-does> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well i i enjoy this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but it it'll be impersonal <EXT-uh> because here you are <HES-eh> <HES-oo> i'm <CUTOFF-n=not> i can't face you i don't know whether you're really kidding me in what you're <LAUGH-talking_about> sitting there in the <VOCNOISE> in <EXT-that> uh street <LAUGH-cafe_or_not> <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but i really do think we're gonna be interconnected in that sense and uh um <SIL> it it becomes <CUTOFF-ih=impersonal> so much more <SIL> impersonal i guess i'm very strong about the <CUTOFF-p=??> term <VOCNOISE> personal versus impersonal inner communications <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-and> the <EXT-bad> that we've talked about i think will be a part of that ten and twenty years from now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i think we will have begun by that time to try to clean up the act if you will <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh going back to the <ERROR-poli=political> political question i think that financial things who i <ERROR-thank=think> think we will start <SIL> we'll start slowing that down oh i think we'll have less influence <VOCNOISE> uh in the terms of finance and i don't think we'll get back to abraham lincoln days <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but uh <CUTOFF-w=well> if we can swing that pendulum back <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh i think we <VOCNOISE> i think we can and i think we will <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think we can do the same thing with communications uh <SIL> i think we can <VOCNOISE> <SIL> eliminate a <EXT-lot> of the uh bad <VOCNOISE> bad influences <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i do know that over time what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here sort of like the definition of need <VOCNOISE> <SIL> versus luxury <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh those definitions change the definition of socialism democracy that slowly have changed over these times <VOCNOISE> well the same thing will true <SIL> <VOCNOISE> be true with those <VOCNOISE> it's still functioning <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> excuse me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and i think we will also <SIL> slowly swing that pendulum on back to the <SIL> <EXT-and> <SIL> to the family again <VOCNOISE> there are those doomsayer from my point of view are saying that uh <SIL> in in many years to come <VOCNOISE> there won't be such a thing as a family <SIL> uh it's just <HES-you> <VOCNOISE> you go out here you meet a <VOCNOISE> an opposite sex you <CUTOFF-procri=procreate> procreate and you go on your way she goes on her way <VOCNOISE> and she's just as satisfied about going her way as you are going your way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <CUTOFF-ye=yes> yes a lot of that is true <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but i think that <SIL> uh i think that i don't think that's gonna ever happen i think we'll turn that thing around <VOCNOISE> i think this so called divorce rate program as i talked about awhile ago that <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> every <SIL> well fifty percent of the people who marry within five years <VOCNOISE> are no longer together i think that will <SIL> will change and that <SIL> is a very significant thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> 
<IVER>
now that was up to age eighteen to or there about to <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think that the <VOCNOISE> you said get back to the very beginning of the birth and up to kindergarten so forth <CUTOFF-we=well> <VOCNOISE> i that's that's the family <VOCNOISE> but uh i think that we in our educational program <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we really need to start teaching uh <VOCNOISE> what i call the older values uh but but but good values i <UNKNOWN-won't_given_you> whether they're old or new but good values <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system <VOCNOISE> uh starting in the elementary right on up to college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses <VOCNOISE> uh that that devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> assist in teaching <VOCNOISE> but i think that many of the courses <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> other courses ought to have <SIL> elements within them that are teaching value family values <VOCNOISE> um i could even so go so far as to saying chemistry or botany or psychology <VOCNOISE> uh any one of those <VOCNOISE> those are specialized subject <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> the i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those <VOCNOISE> talking about family value family value <VOCNOISE> uh and that will help them <VOCNOISE> permeate the entire society <SIL> and but it's got to start back here in the first and i think <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just uh <EXT-why> don't i just go back and copy cat something she said uh picking up that <CUTOFF-bay=baby> picking up that child and cuddling it um <SIL> and having <VOCNOISE> having that baby touch your skin and uh <VOCNOISE> and uh uh teaching <VOCNOISE> <SIL> how what love is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh you <CUTOFF-do> don't necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother little brother and the little sister <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all of those <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now you say <VOCNOISE> teach that well my god didn't they know that when they first came into this classroom <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no not today <VOCNOISE> not today <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i i dare say that uh the vast majority and i mean above fifty well above fifty percent when i say that i'm not being arbitrary <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> students in high school today <VOCNOISE> probably haven't had their mother or their father <VOCNOISE> <SIL> truly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> hold them and hug them <VOCNOISE> rather than just saying hi johnny <VOCNOISE> bye <IVER>
see you tomorrow <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> hold them <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> feel the warmth of the body <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> hear the conversation quietly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> rather than uh hearing okay <VOCNOISE> time to get out of here you know with a vigorous saying <VOCNOISE> but with pleasant sort of remark <VOCNOISE> these kind i can <CUTOFF-elaborah=elaborate> i could write a whole book on that <VOCNOISE> on this on answer your <ERROR-que-ers=questions> <VOCNOISE> uh but it's these kinds of things are very elementary really <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they're very elementary i guess to <VOCNOISE> our age group but maybe not so sure uh maybe the baby boomers that wouldn't be elementary at all <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> going back to your question about the baby boomers <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i still think they were <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't think they're causing them but then i think it was a happenstance uh with that group <VOCNOISE> with a massive group <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> variant <IVER>

<SIL> my answer to your question is has this eroded i'm gonna answer with the word using the word respect <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh yes i feel that uh <SIL> this has eroded over time <VOCNOISE> uh there's not the respect for our <SIL> elders i don't <VOCNOISE> necessarily mean elders in terms of the uh chronological age but i'm talking in terms of generations <VOCNOISE> the uh there's less respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the great grandparents <VOCNOISE> uh i'm gonna give you a first hand example <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just had a <SIL> uh conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now twenty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> she will come over to my house grandpa's house <VOCNOISE> and she'll come in and she'll flop down in a chair <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it <VOCNOISE> uh i don't ever <SIL> tell her uh do <SIL> to do things <VOCNOISE> and i've pointed out to her that whenever we went to visit grandpa <VOCNOISE> or great grandfather <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> if the if we saw weeds out in the garden we went out and we hoed the garden if we if or the chicken house need to be cleaned uh <VOCNOISE> and they hadn't gotten to it that day we went out and cleaned the chicken house we would say <VOCNOISE> grandpa is it okay if we go out and clean your chicken house well course you knew very well it was gonna be okay <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> a matter of respect though you ask is it okay for us to do it <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> now with her <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i can have dishes out there in the sink uh that are left there for from breakfast maybe <SIL> lunch and <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> she she'll walk out there and will say <VOCNOISE> well grandpa how come your dishes aren't done and then she turns around walks away <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's right you uh huh <SIL> and and she may then go ahead and say <VOCNOISE> well now sometimes she'll ask and sometimes she doesn't but lets assume she did she'll ask <VOCNOISE> is it alright if i have some of this <VOCNOISE> she goes ahead and gets the dishes out so forth <VOCNOISE> she puts them right in there in that sink uh with those other dishes <VOCNOISE> makes no efforts to clean them <SIL> <HES-and> and <SIL> i <SIL> i <SIL> i've seen this in many many many incidents but i'm giving you this is very first hand i know this <VOCNOISE> and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society today <VOCNOISE> so yes in my opinion definitely it's eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> from <SIL> over the time that that <SIL> this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she just used the word penalty <SIL> <EXT-uh> <VOCNOISE> penalty has <ERROR-nlots of different definitions each individual has a mental picture what the word penalty means <VOCNOISE> based upon their own experiences <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all i wanna take just <SIL> and it say it <SIL> penalty in a very general sort of way <SIL> <VOCNOISE> whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left lets come back to about the middle <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm concerned that we are getting away from penalties <SIL> completely <VOCNOISE> and i feel it's absolutely essential that we have penalties we have <VOCNOISE> for everyone <SIL> for everyone really across the board uh we we're getting away from penalty we're getting away from penalty <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> uh so many people i just to give an example <VOCNOISE> talking about adults <VOCNOISE> i just read uh statistics the other day right here <ERROR-kah columbus where <VOCNOISE> uh it was an extremely high percent i can't quote the percentages <VOCNOISE> of people who uh ignore uh yellow lights and and of consequence they are ending up going through red lights <VOCNOISE> and there many many many accidents taking place <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i <SIL> and we <SIL> it used to be that you could place uh uh an a law enforcement officer the corner if it happened and he immediately he would uh <VOCNOISE> penalize you by giving your ticket and you face the <SIL> court as the case may be <VOCNOISE> well now we have passed so many little ordinances and laws and change the <VOCNOISE> enforcement policies and this kinds of things <VOCNOISE> well the poor police officer he can't even do that any longer he's got <VOCNOISE> if somebody uh runs through red light you almost have to hit somebody <VOCNOISE> and then be accused for going through the red light <SIL> he can't just arbitrarily be there because that's called <VOCNOISE> <EXT-oh> i think the word harassment plays a part <VOCNOISE> you are harassing that individual because you were standing there waiting for him <VOCNOISE> to commit this problem <VOCNOISE> when i <SIL> let's just get away from that example you can talk about whether you did you were carrying <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i don't want to get in to the guns and knives and stuff in the school that's enough for 
<SIL> heard about that but <VOCNOISE> the same principle applies <VOCNOISE> but i'm talking about just every day things uh that uh <SIL> people who if you wanna talk <ERROR-atop=about> children primarily <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> there is no penalty any more <VOCNOISE> uh parents are scared to death uh to pick up one up and spank them um with their bare hands or <VOCNOISE> or to make them stand in a corner because they considered <VOCNOISE> and i'm going back to the word harassment child abuse and harassment <VOCNOISE> of consequence um <VOCNOISE> and a <HES-hard> uh and penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply <VOCNOISE> look at janie and say janie <VOCNOISE> you should not do that <IVER>
and the stern expression or the expression on that face <VOCNOISE> <SIL> can be <SIL> equally effective as the smack oh on the bottom <VOCNOISE> oh with the bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be <VOCNOISE> i know that my the most effective penalty for me was my mother <VOCNOISE> uh would uh go out <VOCNOISE> near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder <VOCNOISE> and yeah it left marks <VOCNOISE> but <HES-it> and sure it hurt i mean it would sting <VOCNOISE> and i understood exactly what was meant and i think i grew up and i've ended up being i think a quite successful person i think my mother <VOCNOISE> had uh <VOCNOISE> uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty doggone decent kids <VOCNOISE> and none of us were injured none of us were hurt uh <VOCNOISE> and that was a basic method of <VOCNOISE> penalty <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ih=it> it wasn't something that <VOCNOISE> truly <CUTOFF-hur=hurt> injured <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> now today however <VOCNOISE> uh i suspect my mom could easily be <CUTOFF-ha=have> could have been charged with abuse in fact <VOCNOISE> child abuse <VOCNOISE> because it left a mark across my shoulder where that <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> green <CUTOFF-swi=switch> it's always a green switch because uh uh the <HES-eh> old ones they would break you didn't want them break <LAUGH-break> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> there was just something about that sting <VOCNOISE> far better far more than a paddle paddle was kind of a whop and then was end up with a sting and it kind of got your attention <SIL> and then you <CUTOFF-remem=remembered> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> appeals appeals <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there was an in depth story about that i think it was <VOCNOISE> i <UNKNOWN-don't_know> was harper's magazine or what it was in a <VOCNOISE> uh uh <ERROR-say=a> significant magazine where they had uh made a study of the new york situation <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> the i found that quite interesting and very very impressive <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> as a matter of fact <SIL> <VOCNOISE> whatever it was i remember <VOCNOISE> sending it in to the uh city council uh oh of dayton i just addressed the 
city council of dayton and <VOCNOISE> had <VOCNOISE> highlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that uh they would do something along that line <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> shoulda gone to columbus at the same time <VOCNOISE> very interesting <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>

<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't whether i've ever pointed out this <SIL> this out to you but he happened to be one of my uh fellow students down at ohio university <VOCNOISE> now how he happened to learn <LAUGH-all_these_things_like_he_did_I_don't_know> <VOCNOISE> i didn't <VOCNOISE> course he started out it he <UNKNOWN> he <SIL> i think the very first thing he was township trustee like <SIL> paul was <VOCNOISE> and then he also went and became the mayor of cincinnati and he was a very effective <VOCNOISE> oh yeah he was a very very effective he was well liked <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there has been some serious consideration but no uh there were some a lot <VOCNOISE> someone took up a petition and was urging to do it but he's decided <VOCNOISE> he did not want to devote that much time away from his uh <VOCNOISE> his <CUTOFF-te=television> television program <VOCNOISE> oh he he's quite a smart fellow really <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some of this <VOCNOISE> conversation we've had here <VOCNOISE> uh has been influenced within our family <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> we have <VOCNOISE> ministers we have doctors we have lawyers we have uh <VOCNOISE> farmers we have uh <LAUGH-politicians> uh what else <LAUGH-we_got_in_there> <VOCNOISE> we have <CUTOFF-profe=professors> <IVER>

i was going then relate to <SIL> a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh uh but that was one comment she was talking about but then <VOCNOISE> on the <SIL> very very opposite extreme <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> extreme opposite <VOCNOISE> we talk about <SIL> the love of the child from the day of birth <VOCNOISE> and this may seem to be <VOCNOISE> contradictory <VOCNOISE> and i'm not quite sure how to address that <VOCNOISE> because in a in in some some people would say now wait a minute you're talking out of out both sides your mouth the expression is <VOCNOISE> how can you say over here you must have the love of this child <VOCNOISE> in your arms and <VOCNOISE> and then over here you're saying you believe in capital <VOCNOISE> punishment and electrocution <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> i don't think they get the attention they need <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but <SIL> i don't think it's bad <IVER>
i don't think it's bad because he did go to a day care when he was little <VOCNOISE> before his grandmother started watching him <VOCNOISE> and um um <VOCNOISE> i mean it <EXT-was> yknow <CUTOFF-you=your> you're got people you don't know watching your kid and that's kinda scary but <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> you <VOCNOISE> gotta check things out first before you put your kid anywhere <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> yeah for them to go to a <CUTOFF-dayc=daycare> yeah make <SIL> i would think <VOCNOISE> he'll for them to interact with the kids more yeah <VOCNOISE> but <CUTOFF-whe=where> <VOCNOISE> where he goes there's he's got <ERROR-ill=all> <ERROR-z=his> cousins and stuff there with him so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah he's not getting that i don't think he's getting that learning <VOCNOISE> he's he's more his <VOCNOISE> uh that's his grandmother yknow watching him <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i <HES-wish> <CUTOFF-s=she> that she would like <SIL> do more of the learning things that the day cares do do yknow <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i guess <IVER>
yeah <CUTOFF-I=I> <VOCNOISE> i yknow get on her to make sure she sits down and reads with him <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> because i do put when i get home with him i <VOCNOISE> yknow sit down do his a b c's one two threes but <VOCNOISE> he loves to read books so i try to get her to do that <ERROR-inthed=instead> of just let them play all day and <IVER>
just yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
nope <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she that's a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> no <LAUGH> <IVER>
well <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> as <SIL> i mean like i was saying i <VOCNOISE> he's at the ages where he needs to <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> start learning things and she just does not do that i and that's probably the way she raised her kids <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> no we have totally different opinions about everything <IVER>
period <VOCNOISE> because they're from <VOCNOISE> um a different <SIL> they're from the virgin islands <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> so they're like <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-d=differet> not american ways yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> yeah i <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> discipline she's not <VOCNOISE> she's not as <ERROR-shirk=strict> as i am i don't <IVER>
i don't allow no hitting no yknow <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> she kind of <CUTOFF-neg=neglects> <SIL> lets it get away she lets him be a little rough because he's a boy but <VOCNOISE> i don't <VOCNOISE> hm <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> they're all <VOCNOISE> boys <IVER>
they're all boys there <VOCNOISE> so <LAUGH> when i pick him up from there <EXT-he's> <VOCNOISE> out of hand <VOCNOISE> a little bit and i've gotta <VOCNOISE> get him back yknow you're with mommy now you've got to behave <VOCNOISE> settle down <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i work <VOCNOISE> i work part time <VOCNOISE> kind of <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i worked full time <VOCNOISE> when he <CUTOFF-w=was> <VOCNOISE> was uh <VOCNOISE> yknow one and i didn't uh i felt like <SIL> um the babysitters or <VOCNOISE> yknow whoever saw him more than i did <VOCNOISE> and that <CUTOFF-re=really> because i love my son more then anything in the world and i <VOCNOISE> felt like he needed me <VOCNOISE> yknow so i went down to part time <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-t=to> <SIL> i'm struggling more but <VOCNOISE> i'd rather see my son have me <SIL> yknow <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> see i <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's a he's just <SIL> he's <SIL> in his twos and i like <SIL> he's got to be in a cart <SIL> or something <SIL> well because when i'm holding his hand and taking him he just tends to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> want to <CUTOFF-f=?> <SIL> he's not calm and <ERROR-collective-collected> he's <CUTOFF-w=wild> <SIL> a little <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so like that's why we don't do nothing because when i take him to people's houses <VOCNOISE> he i can't do that because he'll get into everything and <VOCNOISE> i um <SIL> i get real stressed out about that i don't i don't <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so <LAUGH> i'm like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah i do that <IVER>
i i <VOCNOISE> make him <CUTOFF-s=sit?> yknow time out <VOCNOISE> well now <VOCNOISE> for <VOCNOISE> two minutes <IVER>

or anything like that i do smack his hands <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> because he <SIL> he likes <SIL> he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit <SIL> people <VOCNOISE> and i smack his hands for that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> i try not to yell but it's <LAUGH-hard> not to yell i try to talk to him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
talk to him like yknow this <CUTOFF-z=?> <CUTOFF-d=?> be nice dan <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> <SIL> but eventually it went away i just <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I> <SIL> i just because i would get stressed out and start crying and go crazy <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <LAUGH> <IVER>
and <SIL> my mother was always there for me i would just call my mom like <SIL> hey what can i do <VOCNOISE> and she just like calm down rachel just calm down and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

but it wasn't the worry about getting pregnant it was the worry about getting aids <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i never <CUTOFF-d=did> i never did it and i <VOCNOISE> yknow wish i could have waited till i was married but <SIL> i <CUTOFF-k=?> <VOCNOISE> yknow you're going through that <VOCNOISE> whatever you go through when you're a teenager so you're like so what <VOCNOISE> well most kids i'm not <SIL> yknow some people <CUTOFF-st=still> some kids still do that but <VOCNOISE> i think i yes i do think they should put that <SIL> in it also that <IVER>
well i should tell them that they should love themselves the <CUTOFF-wa=?> the girls should wear <VOCNOISE> both of them should love their bodies and not <VOCNOISE> yknow give it to a boy that's yknow falling all over you and you're <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-y=you> you feel all good and this and that you should respect yourself and love your body <EXT-and> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> don't let don't give yourself to somebody just because you're feeling you're feeling good <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and the boys i should <LAUGH> the boys need to calm down <LAUGH> um <VOCNOISE> i don't <SIL> i i mean <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

i was ready to settle down i'm not <SIL> yknow i wasn't going for that stuff no more and he still wanted to do that <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> and lie and cheat make up stories and <VOCNOISE> and he still does it <SIL> i don't and and i don't understand why i feel like he's a grown man if he was out <VOCNOISE> don't make up a story <SIL> and <SIL> his mother also make <SIL> yknow they're just it just <VOCNOISE> it's very stressful for me and <VOCNOISE> and i that's another <VOCNOISE> another reason why i don't want my son going there for <CUTOFF-v=very> <SIL> yknow much longer <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> his dad pays <SIL> pays her <LAUGH> for the <LAUGH-babysitting> <VOCNOISE> because i can't afford it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

it <IVER>
well it's kind of hard he see <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> he's got two other kids <VOCNOISE> and one kid he had while we was together <SIL> that he does not see at all <IVER>
because the mother <SIL> um he played her because he was with me and <VOCNOISE> yknow if <SIL> and she just was like forget him i don't want him to be around my child and the other one <VOCNOISE> she's a older she's <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she's like ten <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> he says that because his daughter don't call he only <CUTOFF-ca=calls> she only calls for <SIL> when she wants things <VOCNOISE> so he doesn't <VOCNOISE> yknow he'll <SIL> he'll get whatever he can for her when she calls but he doesn't spend time with her <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> so i just see a pattern <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> i just feel like this is gonna happen to me eventually <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
right <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i'm sort of in <SIL> upper clintonville <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> not so much <SIL> um <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> for <VOCNOISE> for fifteen years i lived uh down on <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> which is more <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-l=lot> a <SIL> <CUTOFF-I'm=I'm> <SIL> lot of artists live there but i'm amazed that my new street <SIL> is full of artists too <IVER>
it's just yknow <SIL> older <LAUGH-artists> <LAUGH-more> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> more established artists <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <SIL> no <SIL> no <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> lower clintonville <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <UNKNOWN-m> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <SIL> uh <SIL> the the the public <SIL> transit system i mean i know they're doing the best they can but i don't see how we're ever gonna get out of this without light rail <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i'm <LAUGH-really_bummed> <IVER>
that that that the levy didn't pass <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> let's see <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> boy <SIL> i <SIL> i don't know <SIL> i mean we got a great airport with great connections and cheap flights <LAUGH-everywhere> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's no that's no drawback we're not isolated <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> boy i don't i <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> um and <SIL> <CUTOFF-thi=this> <SIL> this is something i've thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it's very <SIL> <VOCNOISE> conservative <SIL> yknow not real open to new things <VOCNOISE> or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it'd be really competitive <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i probably wouldn't be <SIL> working as a freelancer today <VOCNOISE> i came to columbus there wasn't <SIL> yknow there wasn't much going on when i came here <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh yknow it's <SIL> oh we've got art <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we're open to that <SIL> yknow <IVER>
yknow there's not a big established gallery system and everything so a lot of things were just available <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just <SIL> could walk in and show anywhere <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and so i yknow i met a lot of people doing that <SIL> and it's <CUTOFF-d=?> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean i'm <CUTOFF-st=still?> mainly friends with <SIL> the same people i met then yknow <CUTOFF-pe=people> <CUTOFF-m=my?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-m=my?> <SIL> artists my age but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's been <SIL> and there's yknow i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't belong to any formal <SIL> groups in columbus <SIL> but <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> it's a <CUTOFF-r=real> it's a real strong network of people yknow everybody <CUTOFF-n=knows> <SIL> knows <SIL> everybody <IVER>
yknow so it's uh yknow if <CUTOFF-yo=you> if you have a problem if you wanna talk to somebody <VOCNOISE> well if if somebody you know personally doesn't they know somebody <IVER>
who can <CUTOFF-s=?> who can help you with that so <IVER>
um <SIL> i have work in uh p m gallery in the short north <IVER>
and also at the show of hands <SIL> galleries <SIL> and <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah ellen at lane avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean <SIL> i was really lucky <SIL> <LAUGH-to_run> across her <IVER>
um they try to limit the the <CUTOFF-s=?> <IVER>
the <SIL> uh <SIL> i said i didn't belong to any groups and that's not true i belong to ohio designer craftsmen <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> uh they <CUTOFF-tr=try> <SIL> in the in the shops they try to limit it to ohio <SIL> artists but <VOCNOISE> the membership is <SIL> is <SIL> national <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not it's not really closed <SIL> it's just <SIL> sort of focusing on ohio <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-th=think> i think it fills its niche <SIL> yknow i mean i mean wexner has a niche and the and the museum has a niche <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> i think it fills it very well <IVER>
<CUTOFF-we=well> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> 
<IVER>
well i'm lucky in that way because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i get travel <SIL> a lot <SIL> and it and so <SIL> yknow if there's something i really wanna see chicago's not that far <VOCNOISE> washington's not that far <SIL> um new york's <SIL> and <ERROR-n'yoh=y'know> i don't get to new york that often but um <SIL> yknow i mean i can i <CUTOFF-s=still> <SIL> still have access to a lot of stuff if i wanna <SIL> go to the trouble <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> i do i do <SIL> um <SIL> art fairs <SIL> <IVER>
and i have <SIL> yknow i've <SIL> <VOCNOISE> got a couple in chicago and and i have couple in <VOCNOISE> uh the washington area <IVER>
so <SIL> <IVER>
oh lots of people travel <SIL> all over <SIL> i <SIL> yknow i mean that's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't <SIL> lots <EXCLUDE-of> people do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i mean they do shows on christmas if they had them but <NOISE> i yknow i <SIL> i'd do <SIL> ten twelve a year <IVER>
which is not <CUTOFF-real=really> <SIL> not a lot <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
me <SIL> yeah <SIL> uh for me <SIL> uh <SIL> it <SIL> it seems like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i have a mid western sort of humor <SIL> <VOCNOISE> which works best in the mid west <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean i have <SIL> i have some <SIL> east coast clientele and and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-bu=but> <SIL> and <SIL> but like when i go to florida <SIL> <IVER>
the people who <SIL> who really like my work <SIL> happen to be the people who are vacationing from <SIL> columbus so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i've never been to that one <SIL> that one has a big <CUTOFF-rep=reputation> <SIL> that's a <SIL> <IVER>
a famous one <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh yeah it's huge <IVER>
<SIL> well <SIL> <UNKNOWN-ynkow?> i <CUTOFF-r=read> <SIL> i <SIL> read a lot about <SIL> about <SIL> uh <SIL> these particular <ERROR-Britis=British> <SIL> british artists <SIL> even before the show and before <VOCNOISE> um the mayor had a cow <SIL> so to speak but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> so i <SIL> yknow i mean it's <SIL> some of some of the pieces are interesting it's <SIL> it's not <SIL> exactly <CUTOFF-m=my> my style <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> frankly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> yknow <SIL> i <SIL> just didn't see <LAUGH-anything_to_get_that_worked> up about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean i <HES-saw> i saw <CUTOFF-r=?> <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <SIL> the piece <SIL> the piece that he specifically objected to and and <SIL> read about it <SIL> and <SIL> <SIL> <LAUGH> so i mean i have to assume that it <SIL> i mean it's an election year and <IVER>
<SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
his yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> i think it was just a political thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i haven't i haven't heard the rest of the story <SIL> but <SIL> um what i've heard of <SIL> i mean <SIL> in <SIL> in court he wouldn't have a chance <SIL> a snowball's <LAUGH-chance_of_ever> <SIL> <IVER>
<UNKNOWN-ever??> <SIL> actually being able to <SIL> to rescind the funding but still <SIL> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a <SIL> <LAUGH-it's> <SIL> we don't like to think <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-about_these> things happening <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> a little bit yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-well> well i know about the gorilla masks <SIL> <LAUGH-and_and_the> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that uh yknow i <UNKNOWN-word_word> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a a women's organization <CUTOFF-tha=that> <SIL> uh <SIL> to promote women artists <SIL> and and to um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-obje=object> object to the <SIL> to male hierarchy <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-th=the?> <SIL> that only only men get are in the museums and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> only men get the big <SIL> gallery shows and stuff like that <IVER>
<SIL> i <CUTOFF-d=don't> i don't think so <SIL> in new york it might be <SIL> i mean like i say it's a lot more competitive there here <SIL> i think <SIL> i think <SIL> columbus <SIL> is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and the mid west in general <SIL> i <SIL> think is much <SIL> more open <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> to <UNKNOWN-word_word> <SIL> yknow to art whatever it is wherever it comes from <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and there's not the isn't yknow there's not <SIL> the <SIL> the <SIL> old boy network <SIL> yknow <SIL> not as not as much who you know <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> to get into things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <CUTOFF-o=or> <SIL> or <CUTOFF-th=that> <SIL> or that <SIL> women are allowed to know the people <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that the boys know <SIL> so it's not <SIL> it's not as closed off that <SIL> way <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> ah <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah it's true i i <SIL> i <SIL> i had jansen and i <SIL> i'm yknow that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> course i was <SIL> i went to art school so jansen was just in case you had to look something up it was there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> our lecturers were all <LAUGH-pretty_pretty_liberal> <SIL> so that yknow <CUTOFF-w=we?> <SIL> that the art history <CUTOFF-g=?> <SIL> we got was <SIL> was different than <SIL> what would be <SIL> what would just be in jansen so i never <SIL> thought about that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
lots of people who <SIL> jansen is their only exposure <SIL> would <LAUGH-think> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> gee i wonder why women don't do <LAUGH-art> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but historically <SIL> yknow women <SIL> were <CUTOFF-no=not> yknow <SIL> it was a man's field and and yknow even women who were doing it and doing it well didn't get <SIL> the attention didn't get <IVER>
<SIL> they didn't make it into the history books yeah <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <UNKNOWN-word_word> but <CUTOFF-ya=yknow> yknow i mean that would that's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's <SIL> <LAUGH-civilization_wide> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think so <SIL> i think so if you're willing and yknow <SIL> anybody who's willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to <SIL> yknow that you have to sell yourself there's <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're not gonna just sit around and wait to be discovered <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <SIL> if you put out the effort i really <CUTOFF-do=don't> <SIL> i don't think there's <SIL> that kind of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that kind of discrimination anymore <SIL> <IVER>
badly <LAUGH-I <VOCNOISE> <SIL> marketing is not my strong suit i mean most of the stuff that i get is just <SIL> is a <SIL> is an accident i started working for o s u because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> another <SIL> uh illustrator that they used who wasn't gonna be able to do the work anymore recommended me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow that kind of thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but he was a guy <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
well there's <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> i'm pretty much <SIL> you just <SIL> keep making calls making appointments <VOCNOISE> sending out slides <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um it helps if you can get a <CUTOFF-re=referral> <SIL> yknow if you know an artist who's <SIL> in a gallery <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=if> yknow if you can <SIL> use them as a <CUTOFF-ref=referral> <SIL> as a reference <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but that <SIL> it's <SIL> it's mainly just <CUTOFF-sh=?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> you <SIL> just have to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh knock on a lot of doors <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and be prepared for a lot of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> of <SIL> no's <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum <IVER>
um three years <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum 
<IVER>
oh <CUTOFF-the=they> well they knew <SIL> all <CUTOFF-d=different> all different things <SIL> i mean i mean culturally <VOCNOISE> yknow it was different <VOCNOISE> different music it was it <CUTOFF-w=was?> <SIL> course i'm i'm <SIL> in a suburban high school in cincinnati you didn't get exposed to much <SIL> uh so that <CUTOFF-wa=was> that was the <SIL> <CUTOFF-b=biggest> <SIL> the biggest thing <SIL> well and of course they talk funny <SIL> in the east but <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> other than that other than the culture shock <SIL> um <SIL> it wasn't <SIL> it wasn't that different <IVER>
yeah if i had <SIL> um <SIL> if i had stayed for the i i didn't graduate so if i'd stayed for the fourth year <SIL> um when we did a lot would do a lot of um <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <SIL> making up a portfolio that kind of thing <SIL> um <SIL> i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i <CUTOFF-pro=probably> i would've <SIL> i probably would've stayed <SIL> but <SIL> it was <IVER>
yeah <SIL> oh yeah yeah i liked it a lot <SIL> um <SIL> but it was it was nineteen seventy and there was kent state and <LAUGH-there_was> <VOCNOISE> yknow all that stuff going on and it just <VOCNOISE> school just didn't seem that important <LAUGH> <SIL> <SIL> and also i think i think this happens to a lot of people as they approach senior year and say oh my god yknow i'm gonna graduate and then i'm gonna have to be a grownup <VOCNOISE> ok <SIL> i won't graduate <LAUGH> <IVER>

<SIL> i <SIL> yknow maybe i'm oblivious to things but i mean i mean seems like there's <SIL> lot of worse places <IVER>
<SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <cutoff=from> from my <VOCNOISE> perspective which is skewed of course <SIL> to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was <VOCNOISE> we're only talking about ten cases that's not very many <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-tha=that?> i mean <SIL> you could by coincidence <SIL> have them all be african american <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective <SIL> and i yknow i don't <SIL> don't live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> yknow i just don't <SIL> i'm <CUTOFF-no=not> i'm not in touch with it <SIL> with that situation <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

yeah yeah yeah i it surprises me to <CUTOFF-hea=hear> to find that that columbus is is so out of shape <SIL> um <SIL> but i'm <SIL> in the i <SIL> well yknow in the circles that i move in <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> everybody is very <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> middle aged and they all quit <LAUGH-smoking_and_they're_all_all_of> the sudden trying to beat off the reaper <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i mean i mean <SIL> well and course they were always hippies and ate sprouts and <SIL> twigs and leaves <SIL> anyway <SIL> yknow so <CUTOFF-th=that's> <SIL> yknow that's the sort of circles i move in but i know <SIL> because i <CUTOFF-ta=take?> have these part time jobs from time to time <SIL> i see a a whole different <SIL> group of people <SIL> and i can say it's <SIL> probably true <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah_yeah> <SIL> <LAUGH-word_word> <IVER>
yeah so i <CUTOFF-tha=that> i mean that <SIL> probably <SIL> circles i move in is what's <SIL> coloring my whole view of columbus <SIL> i mean there's <SIL> a lot <CUTOFF-th=there's> i'm sure there's a lot i don't <SIL> know <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> yeah and i <CUTOFF-th=think> i think i think even even <SIL> if you're aware of everything that's here you still <SIL> in the back of your mind you just have that <SIL> it's <CUTOFF-Colu=Columbus> it's just columbus it's just columbus <SIL> ah maybe it's because <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> people don't <SIL> take advantage of <CUTOFF-w=what's> <SIL> don't realize what's actually here <SIL> um <SIL> don't realize how it <SIL> i mean yeah it's not chicago <SIL> it's not new york <SIL> it's not <LAUGH-San_Fransico> there's a lot of places it's not <SIL> but it's <CUTOFF-n=not> <SIL> ah <SIL> yknow it's not a backwater either <SIL> well they need to get out more <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_mean> yknow all this <SIL> oh we'll never be a major league city until we have major league sports <UNKNOWN-is_a?> <SIL> well <CUTOFF-I=I> yknow i guess <SIL> um getting out more wouldn't help those <LAUGH-people> <SIL> it's um <SIL> ah <SIL> that that would be <CUTOFF-th=the?> <SIL> yknow that would be such a small <SIL> part <SIL> of <SIL> of <SIL> civilization anywhere <SIL> for me <SIL> and um <SIL> i'm pretty pleased with the way <SIL> things are moving along and i just <SIL> i'd <SIL> i'm <SIL> i really do think people don't take advantage of it <SIL> the way they should <IVER>
<SIL> i think so <IVER>
i think so <IVER>
<LAUGH-well> <LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH> yeah a little <IVER>
a little geography wouldn't hurt <IVER>
yeah that <SIL> that's one of the drawbacks <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
or the festivals in the summer <SIL> that they have downtown <SIL> i mean those are <SIL> those are really great and they're yknow i mean <SIL> they're they're crowded but they're peaceful yknow there's not there's not rioting in the streets and there's a lot to do <SIL> and great <SIL> yknow great music <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
no i don't <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> i <CUTOFF-d=do> <SIL> i do <SIL> 
ah <SIL> i have i've have <SIL> uh <SIL> and yknow there kids in the neighborhood and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the grownups talk and i <CUTOFF-t=talk> i talk to the kids too i there's a a girl that lives next door who i we talk a lot <VOCNOISE> she just started at um everett <SIL> the uh <SIL> arts middle school <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
boy <SIL> i <SIL> yknow <SIL> i <SIL> i don't <SIL> not having kids and then yknow not being that close to it it's hard to know <SIL> i mean i've always <SIL> i've always thought that <SIL> that <SIL> um <SIL> what their friends did <NOISE> and what they <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what they were exposed to at home <SIL> had <SIL> as much <SIL> influence as as anything that <SIL> that the school could do but i know the school <SIL> school is a very powerful force in a kid's life <SIL> yknow i mean it is a kid's life <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> with <CUTOFF-tha=that?> <SIL> no i no i am definitely in favor of that i mean <SIL> yes <SIL> it's the <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it?> the parents <SIL> is the parent is supposed to do it <SIL> and one would hope that the <SIL> parent <SIL> would get there before <SIL> before the health class did but if the parent isn't gonna get there <SIL> this is the only way they're <SIL> ever gonna <SIL> find <LAUGH-out> <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i think it is <SIL> because <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> when <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> i was a sophomore in high school before it dawned on me that tab a and slot b <LAUGH-had_any_relation> to the stuff that we were learning with the charts and the diagrams <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> but i think kids are a lot more aware now <SIL> from <SIL> <CUTOFF-c=?> because of what they're exposed to <VOCNOISE> yknow in movies and everything <CUTOFF-j=just> yknow just <SIL> tv just daily life <VOCNOISE> um either they're a lot more aware <SIL> they <SIL> they have <SIL> i <SIL> <HES-I> <HES-they> they go into it with a lot of <VOCNOISE> of uh myths and misapprehensions <SIL> but they definitely have thoughts about it <SIL> and and <SIL> i think they i think they need to <LAUGH-know> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i well <SIL> yknow i <CUTOFF-d=don't> <SIL> i don't see how we can say <SIL> <HES-I i mean <SIL> we can <CUTOFF-refuse> <SIL> refuse to <CUTOFF-see> <SIL> to see certain classes <SIL> of <SIL> movies or <SIL> or watch <SIL> certain classes of shows but i <SIL> yknow without getting into that first amendment thing i can't <SIL> yknow i don't see how we can <SIL> have a code of conduct <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> boy i don't know <SIL> i'm <SIL> i'm <SIL> yknow i've <VOCNOISE> never seen it happen in <SIL> in my lifetime <SIL> yknow <SIL> so i <CUTOFF-do=don't> i don't know if it could be but then of course it can't go on the same way <SIL> <CUTOFF-forev=forever> yknow it can't <SIL> keep <SIL> <LAUGH-progressing> <VOCNOISE> i don't <SIL> think <IVER>
the <LAUGH-naked> weather girl <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-we=well it it <IVER>
<HES-it> it makes me wonder because <SIL> um <SIL> i don't <SIL> i don't see a lot of movies so a lot of this is yknow just <SIL> from reading reviews and stuff <SIL> but it seems like <SIL> yknow <SIL> last <SIL> last year two explosions would do the <SIL> job this year you gotta have five explosions <SIL> and two car <SIL> chases <SIL> and and mutilated bodies <SIL> yknow it's it <SIL> just seems like <SIL> it <SIL> it <SIL> you need more and more sensationalism to <SIL> sell your <SIL> to sell your <SIL> product and uh <SIL> it's scary <SIL> <SIL> <HES-I> <SIL> it's <CUTOFF-r=really> <SIL> it's really hard to do <SIL> to <SIL> to <SIL> talk about <SIL> morals <SIL> um without <SIL> bringing <SIL> uh yknow <SIL> religious background or something into it i think <SIL> i think <SIL> ah <SIL> the way the schools should approach it <LAUGH-is_that> <SIL> if you get pregnant it's gonna ruin your life so you don't want to do that <SIL> do you <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow_that> sort of thing <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> boy that's a <SIL> that's a really tough one <SIL> i hadn't i hadn't thought about <SIL> that and and <SIL> high school kids are so <SIL> touchy about <SIL> i mean <SIL> about <SIL> touchy about sexual identity and <SIL> and so likely <CUTOFF-th=that?> yknow so insecure in their own that they're really <SIL> likely to come down hard on somebody <SIL> who has a has a different orientation <VOCNOISE> and i <CUTOFF-do=don't> i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah you can't ignore it <SIL> i <CUTOFF-m=mean?> <SIL> because <CUTOFF-be=because> <SIL> yknow because that's <SIL> something else when i was in high school i <CUTOFF-d=don't> <SIL> don't <SIL> think <VOCNOISE> i knew the word <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> now <CUTOFF-everyb=everybody> <SIL> everybody knows <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> anybody who's a little bit different is likely to be called a faggot <LAUGH> and and <VOCNOISE> so it's <SIL> better if you can diffuse that but <SIL> i <CUTOFF-w=wouldn't> boy i wouldn't know <SIL> how to approach it <SIL> i mean i think it should be approached <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i wouldn't have a clue <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i think <SIL> i think they should <SIL> um <SIL> i <SIL> think a lot of the fear of this material comes <SIL> uh <SIL> from people who hold the belief that <SIL> that <SIL> you choose <SIL> your orientation <VOCNOISE> that you can be converted <SIL> to homosexuality and i <SIL> personally don't believe that so it <SIL> i yknow i'm not afraid <SIL> of it <SIL> but i can see how <SIL> people would hold the opposite view <SIL> and that i that's where this <ERROR-comefmi=comes_from> comes from but <SIL> since i think they're wrong <LAUGH> <SIL> i think it should be my way <SIL> and i think i think yknow <CUTOFF-th=the> i think the material should be there <SIL> i think it <CUTOFF-sh=should> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow dealt with in a calm and reasonable way <SIL> and i think it should be accessible to the kids <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> i <SIL> think <SIL> i think it's <CUTOFF-f=fair> i think it's fair i think it should be <SIL> that domestic partners <SIL> should be <SIL> should be covered <VOCNOISE> i think there should probably be some <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow some <CUTOFF-r=restrictions> some restrictions there should <SIL> be some level of 
<SIL> commitment <SIL> yknow <SIL> can't just be your roommate <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> has to be a long standing kind of thing <VOCNOISE> yeah yknow and that that worries me more than <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-um> <SIL> i <HES-I> <CUTOFF-eh=?> <SIL> understand a lot of the objection is because this is just <SIL> uh <SIL> this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> yknow one legal <SIL> step leads to another legal step and then we'll have gay marriage and all those things but <VOCNOISE> i don't think that would be a bad <NOISE-thing> either <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah yeah i heard something about that <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-do_it_the_hard_way_or_the_easy_way> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> well i <NOISE-think> everybody should have to do it the hard way <SIL> i mean frankly <VOCNOISE> um i think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_mean> i know i didn't think that much about it oh well i'm not doing anything else why not <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> ah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-mea=mean> i mean ah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't i it seems <SIL> kind of silly to legally have <SIL> two levels i mean either <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> either you gonna <VOCNOISE> <SIL> go do it the hard way or you not <IVER>
<SIL> and and <SIL> no legal sanctions are gonna make any particular difference <VOCNOISE> to the attitude you have going into it <IVER>
right <IVER>
divorced yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> three years <SIL> something like that <SIL> hard to remember <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-it_was_a_long_time_ago> <IVER>
oh it was it was easy <IVER>
um <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> <CUTOFF-w=we> yeah we didn't go to court <SIL> uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> we just agreed <SIL> to get divorced he went to <CUTOFF-s=see?> he yknow i didn't even see the lawyer he just brought papers for me to sign and <SIL> <IVER>
yeah there was yknow there was no property <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um well there was a house i didn't want it <VOCNOISE> so that was easy <SIL> <IVER>
um no children <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was quite easy for us <SIL> <IVER>
hum <IVER>
<SIL> boy i don't know i'm <CUTOFF-t=?> <SIL> thinking <SIL> yknow of the the <SIL> divorced people i know who've had <SIL> children and <VOCNOISE> involved <SIL> and um <SIL> boy it always seems to me by the time they get to that step <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> it's already <SIL> yknow they've <LAUGH-already> been to counseling they've already tried a lot of other things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that they're <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=I> <SIL> i don't know whether <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some kind of <SIL> court ordered <VOCNOISE> <SIL> thinking about it <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> heavy thinking would uh <IVER>
would make any difference or not <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
i think so <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think they should be <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think they should be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny <SIL> that <SIL> that um hetero couples are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow with home visits and and economic tests and all these kind of things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <VOCNOISE> the gay people i know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> the ones that would <VOCNOISE> that would want to be parents i think would make great parents <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well one would <CUTOFF-n=?> one would hope that <SIL> there would be enough <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE-word_word> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> education on the subject that the kids wouldn't think it was that odd <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> that <SIL> that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you had two dads <IVER>
<LAUGH-you> were adopted by two <LAUGH-dads> i mean <VOCNOISE> i mean there's <SIL> <CUTOFF-l=lot?> <SIL> a lot uh <CUTOFF-y=??> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-becau=because> <CUTOFF-i=it's?> <SIL> it's it's difficult to adopt children i mean and it and it should be <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so <SIL> the children they would likely <SIL> take would be troubled to begin with <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yknow mixed race <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or or handicapped or <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> hard to place <IVER>
older kids yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh yeah it would be just one more thing <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> one more thing to deal with on the other hand <VOCNOISE> it beats <SIL> beats <SIL> yknow <SIL> growing up in fifty foster homes or an orphanage or <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> getting them some place stable <SIL> <IVER>
with people who want them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
and like i say i don't i don't believe that homosexuality is taught <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> think the kid will grow up and <SIL> discover girls and <SIL> be just fine <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> or grow up and discover boys either <LAUGH-way> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well i <CUTOFF-th=think?> it <SIL> starts with <VOCNOISE> with allowing uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> heather has two mommies <SIL> <IVER>
in the elementary school library <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=?> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we focus on sex so much <VOCNOISE> in our society i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> part of family <CUTOFF-li=life> <UNKNOWN> so uh <SIL> sex is such a small part of family life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh especially with the elementary school kids <SIL> i mean it's just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> is there milk and cookies after school <IVER>
that's the key <LAUGH-thing> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-d=do> yknow do i feel safe is this a place i can go is there somebody <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> who always takes care of me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and and i think left to their own devices <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the younger kids wouldn't think anything about it <SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you got two adults in your house it doesn't matter what gender they are <IVER>
and i think <VOCNOISE> i think if we could <VOCNOISE> yknow if <SIL> if we could just keep that going <SIL> into into <SIL> middle school <SIL> <IVER>
where it's <SIL> where it's not such <SIL> it's <SIL> it's not weird it's just a family <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then when you start to talk about homosexuality it would be easier to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> it would be easier for the kids to <SIL> to see that <SIL> they're just people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i see it as a problem and and if i <SIL> if i <SIL> if i were <VOCNOISE> african american <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i would <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i would not like to see it simply because <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow it it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a <CUTOFF-chi=child> a child not being brought up <SIL> <VOCNOISE> in his <SIL> yknow in his <SIL> tradition <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but on the other hand <VOCNOISE> i'd <SIL> hate to <CUTOFF-s=see> i hate to see <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a child left in foster care <VOCNOISE> or in an orphanage when he could have a home <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> i think ah <VOCNOISE> parents who are willing to <CUTOFF-ado=adopt> <SIL> uh <SIL> going <SIL> willing to adopt <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> a black child or a mixed race child <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or an asian child or any <CUTOFF-ge=?> <VOCNOISE> are gonna are gonna be sensitive to the <SIL> to cultural things because we're just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow it's just the <CUTOFF-w=way> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the way <CUTOFF-th=things> <SIL> things are slanted these days i mean diversity <VOCNOISE> is an issue <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> people who are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> willing to <VOCNOISE> venture out <SIL> into <SIL> uh mixed race adoption <SIL> would <VOCNOISE> <SIL> already be <SIL> way hip 
<SIL> to diversity <VOCNOISE> and would <IVER>
would be <SIL> would be interested <SIL> in <SIL> i mean i mean <VOCNOISE> not just for the kids sake but but would be interested <VOCNOISE> on their own behalf <SIL> in in teaching the child what uh <IVER>
what his background really was <IVER>
right <IVER>
<CUTOFF-e=exactly> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
exactly but i do <VOCNOISE> there and there's the other side um <SIL> they <HES-uh> with <SIL> with native americans too <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> yknow yknow our children are being <NOISE-taken> away from us <SIL> well not exactly you're giving up your children and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-then> <VOCNOISE> something has to be done <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> but there's also <SIL> there's also that <SIL> uh <SIL> i <CUTOFF-m=mean> <SIL> i mean i think <SIL> that <SIL> it is probably a legitimate <SIL> fear that <SIL> children <CUTOFF-o=of> children of that group <SIL> are gonna <SIL> yknow <SIL> gonna be homogenized <VOCNOISE> out of <SIL> out of their heritage <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow they're <NOISE-kids> without parents <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
if you cared that much about about <SIL> keeping your keeping your own <VOCNOISE> well <LAUGH> there's the kids ready to be <LAUGH-adopted> <IVER>
um-hum is <IVER>
that's that's what i would <SIL> i would think in that <NOISE-case> i <ERROR-moon=mean> <SIL> i mean because the dominant culture <VOCNOISE> it i mean is always gonna be accessible to them <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah and <CUTOFF-every=everyone> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-to_you> yeah <SIL> yeah and and to a certain extent everybody gets the same upbringing <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-be=because?> <VOCNOISE> through <CUTOFF-thr=through> mass media <SIL> and and and <NOISE> <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> malls <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
is <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well i <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-wha=what> <SIL> what <SIL> what neighborhood do you live in <SIL> <NOISE-because> <VOCNOISE> i yknow i see asians and indians and <SIL> all <CUTOFF-kin=kinds> <SIL> everywhere but boy they don't live on my street <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> right yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um <SIL> <CUTOFF-ye=yeah> <VOCNOISE> people that live there i mean we've got the the yknow the indian department stores right down there on high street and <VOCNOISE> and a <SIL> couple of asian groceries <SIL> but <LAUGH-I_was> <LAUGH> yknow i <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know where they live <LAUGH> i <LAUGH-mean_it> it seems <CUTOFF-li=like> it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i don't <SIL> i don't know <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i don't know the people that i see <VOCNOISE> around <VOCNOISE> um <NOISE> yknow they're grownups <IVER>
really <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah um you're <CUTOFF-m=maybe?> you yeah you may be right <SIL> could be <SIL> could be <IVER>
i never thought of that <IVER>
an option <IVER>
i think so <SIL> i think so <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it's <SIL> it's so sad to see <SIL> a girl <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> have so many options closed off <SIL> now i don't mean it's by any <CUTOFF-s=stretch> <SIL> stretch that it's a tragedy <VOCNOISE> to have a baby but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> somebody in high school <SIL> is <SIL> is <SIL> making a lot of decisions she doesn't intend to make <IVER>
uh <SIL> and uh <SIL> <UNKNOWN> decisions are happening to her without her making them <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> i think she needs to have <SIL> as many <SIL> facts as she can get her hands on <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and i think <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> of <SIL> course we would all hope that abortion wouldn't be <SIL> that <CUTOFF-n=nobody> that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <SIL> i also think <VOCNOISE> uh yknow i <CUTOFF-me=mean> i mean <SIL> yeah there shouldn't be there shouldn't <CUTOFF-s=shouldn't> shouldn't spend six weeks on abortion <LAUGH-or> <SIL> six weeks on what to do if you're pregnant <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <SIL> but i think the subject has to be mentioned <SIL> just <SIL> just in passing in health class maybe and then and then <SIL> there ought to <CUTOFF-y=yknow> <SIL> it ought to be <SIL> it <CUTOFF-sh=should> <SIL> it should be known that you can go to your counselor <IVER>
and get some information <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah i'm <SIL> i'm opposed to parental <NOISE-consent> <NOISE> <NOISE-um> <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i don't have <NOISE-kids> so that's <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> opinion doesn't mean as <LAUGH-much_as_it_might> from someone who did <IVER>
well <SIL> yeah in a case like that <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> the parents should <LAUGH-know> <SIL> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-because_there's_something_going_on> <IVER>
that shouldn't be <SIL> on the other hand i'd hate to see a thirteen year old <VOCNOISE> have a baby <SIL> because she was afraid <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well yeah <SIL> yeah i mean it happened a lot <SIL> and um <SIL> i've <SIL> had two abortions one <SIL> illegal and one legal and 
legal is better <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah and and <SIL> uh <SIL> i would never <VOCNOISE> i would <CUTOFF-n=never> <SIL> i would never wanna go back to the old way <SIL> never <SIL> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
um i think so i think partial birth isn't <SIL> such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever <VOCNOISE> <SIL> comes up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> with so many things it's it's like a <CUTOFF-f=foot> it's a foot in the door <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if we can do that then we can say well yknow maybe <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not in the <VOCNOISE> third trimester and then we can say well not in the second trimester and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i <SIL> um <SIL> i mean i know <SIL> so many people who <SIL> you know when they get pregnant <SIL> get so <SIL> are so conscientious <SIL> about about what they eat <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and and i mean they won't take antihistamines <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in hay fever season and yknow so many things that they won't do and they're so conscientious about it it's hard for me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean i <CUTOFF-nd=UNKNOWN> i just don't know anybody who <SIL> smoked when they were pregnant or anything like that <SIL> on the other hand i <SIL> think <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> think it's a choice <SIL> and um <SIL> i mean you <CUTOFF-w=wanna> you wanna <SIL> you wanna try to help them you wanna <SIL> make them aware of health <SIL> issues <SIL> but i mean a lot of women are not getting prenatal care <VOCNOISE> <SIL> either <SIL> and <SIL> and <SIL> that's part of it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you can't <VOCNOISE> you <VOCNOISE> can't arrest them for that you just gotta get them to the doctor <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah i <CUTOFF-d=didn't> <CUTOFF-i=?> <SIL> if <SIL> if <SIL> a <CUTOFF-d=?> <SIL> there <CUTOFF-c=can't> there can't be sanctions for doing the right thing <SIL> and <SIL> um <SIL> uh <SIL> so i would be <CUTOFF-o=opposed> i'm opposed to that <SIL> i well yeah i <SIL> i guess <SIL> you'd have to say that i was <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> be opposed to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> arresting mothers for anything <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> in <SIL> in <SIL> in that relation <VOCNOISE> that it's just <SIL> that the effort should focus <VOCNOISE> on <SIL> on getting them to stop <SIL> but not <SIL> forcing them to stop <SIL> whatever it is they're doing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> 
<IVER>
<EXCLUDE-name> <IVER>
okay my parents are still married <SIL> i'm from <EXCLUDE-name> i lived there all my life i was born here in columbus so i really haven't known anything else <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> have a dog named sammy <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i work in the dorms as a night assistant <SIL> and i have a girlfriend right now <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah my dog's at home <IVER>
yeah i have two older brothers one's ten years older the other one's fifteen years older <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um it didn't seem that much <SIL> stranger than anyone else <IVER>
i mean my <SIL> the middle brother was always around <SIL> he wasn't very social in high school so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um i'm a pre art major right now hoping to get into computer animation <IVER>
freshman <IVER>
i went to <EXCLUDE-name> it's the new high school there <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah high school a lot of people are really narrow minded and <SIL> work on really trying to fit in in college people are more open idea like open minded <VOCNOISE> and they're more willing to express their own ideas <IVER>
i was more comfortable here than in high school <SIL> you don't see like <SIL> the big cliques like the popular abercrombie wearing <EXT-people> or <VOCNOISE> like all the art students hanging out together it's <SIL> a big mix of people and everyone's doing their own thing <IVER>
um <SIL> freshman sophomore year yes <SIL> after that i quit wrestling and <SIL> i just kind of found myself being <SIL> myself <SIL> instead of trying to be someone else <SIL> sports is definitely <SIL> part of a clique you try to be part of the <EXT-team> and the team tries to do everything the same <IVER>
so everybody's trying to be like everyone else <IVER>
it was part of that i started wrestling because a lot of my friends did <IVER>
so <SIL> i mean basically the entire winter i'd either <EXT-be> <SIL> doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends so <VOCNOISE> the whole reason i quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight <VOCNOISE> i was really starting to feel it physically <IVER>
yeah i was cutting twenty pounds in three days <IVER>
dehydration <IVER>
you'd run around in three pairs of sweat suits and <SIL> vinyl jump suit over that <VOCNOISE> under heaters <IVER>
you'd sleep in three pairs of sweats so you'd lose about two and a half pounds in your sleep <IVER>
it is that's why i quit <IVER>
by the end i was pretty much <SIL> just puking up blood and passing out a lot <IVER>
there were a lot of teammates that were cutting that much weight if not more <SIL> they were pretty much doing it for the team <NOISE> <IVER>
yeah by then it was junior year <SIL> when we were wrestling <EXT-varisty> and everyone just figured it was two more years left they could just <SIL> struggle through it <IVER>
it definitely did because <SIL> i would sleep <VOCNOISE> probably <SIL> the <SIL> eight hours <SIL> right after practice until i woke up in the morning <IVER>
i delivered the columbus dispatch in the morning too so <IVER>
it was pretty much deliver papers go to class wrestling sleep <IVER>
almost all the parents did <IVER>
but he'd bring in nutritional list or whatever to explain to the <EXT-parents> <SIL> blah blah blah <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
not that i know of none of the other sports teams were so <SIL> inclined to <SIL> like push their athletes to cut weight <IVER>
or to do anything extreme to their bodies <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
and the lower you are apparently the easier it is or something <SIL> that was the coach's philosophy anyway <IVER>
some of them are athletes they're pretty much just <EXT-preppy> student council i'm good at school but bad outside of school <VOCNOISE> they'd go out and party outside of school but they'd join all like the students against drugs programs <IVER>
so they're really hypocritical <IVER>
there's a little bit well quite a bit of it was yeah <SIL> some of the people in the group didn't play sports but it wasn't all from one sport or <SIL> it was football wrestlers <VOCNOISE> it was usually <SIL> like the best football players the best wrestlers <IVER>
in high school yeah i was friends with most of them <IVER>
but i just didn't <SIL> hang out with <SIL> the entire crowd <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
it wasn't so much of a hate thing it was just more these are the people i like to hang out with <EXT-if> <SIL> you don't like that that's fine <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> our school wasn't really a violent one there weren't really any fights or anything <IVER>
it was mostly caucasian <SIL> and very few asian and other ethnicities <IVER>
yeah my roommate actually had that teacher and <SIL> none of the allegations are true <IVER>
she was alleging that students were writing racial slurs on their desks and stuff <SIL> but <SIL> i had friends in classes of hers and none of them wrote any <IVER>
they never saw it they never said anything about it <SIL> 
<SIL> <IVER>
a lot of people switch from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the <SIL> party animal <IVER>
go out and have fun person <IVER>
just the number of people that were here <IVER>
<IVER>
brother <IVER>
brother jed <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <SIL> i talk to him every now and then <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i think every college does <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i'm a lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell <IVER>
is <EXT-really> opposing my beliefs so i stand there and pretty much spar with him about it <EXT-and> he usually ends up getting frustrated and tells me to leave <IVER>
well <SIL> he told a jewish friend of mine that <SIL> her grandparents that died in the holocaust went to hell because they were jewish <SIL> <IVER>
yeah he says <VOCNOISE> a lot of racial slurs like that he's really homophobic <IVER>
where <EXT-as> <VOCNOISE> i don't know lutheran is a little bit more open to <IVER>
homosexuality i guess <IVER>
just pretty much that if you ask for forgiveness forgiveness is granted <VOCNOISE> whatever <IVER>
um doesn't <SIL> just because you sin doesn't mean you're going to <EXT-hell> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> pretty much stuff like <EXT-that> <SIL> and he'd try to quote the bible and i'd have a bible there with me and i'd look it up and <VOCNOISE> it wouldn't <SIL> it wouldn't be right at all <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
well when he's telling my friends that their grandparents went to hell because they're of a different religion <IVER>
that's pretty extreme <IVER>
yeah um <SIL> i've grown up here all my life so it really hasn't shocked me all that <EXT-much> <IVER>
yeah i had about three or four friends that were actually gay <IVER>
it wasn't a huge shock it wasn't my first encounter with homosexuality <IVER>
if they wanna get married that's their business i don't <SIL> think <EXT-its> <SIL> mine or anyone else to say that they can't <IVER>
they're normal people just outside of <SIL> their sexual <SIL> well <SIL> majority of the people prefer <SIL> heterosexual <IVER>
relations but they're normal people outside of they're <SIL> homosexuality i mean it's nothing different than regular parents <IVER>
i <SIL> really am not educated in that at all so i wouldn't <SIL> probably say anything <SIL> since i'd <SIL> ignorant in the field <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah he uses a lot <EXT-of> <SIL> different slurs towards <SIL> gay people <IVER>
yeah i remember political correctness <IVER>
changing the words doesn't change how someone feels about something <IVER>
i don't think its made us any better or any <EXT-worse> <IVER>
it's just change the language <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't think so not with the diversity that we have here <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i mean if we were that racist of a city then we wouldn't be that accepting to <VOCNOISE> gay pride <EXT-marches> and the black out that we had on campus a few weeks back <IVER>
with the n double a c p <IVER>
<SIL> i <VOCNOISE> really don't think we're incredibly racist <IVER>
i mean i'm sure there is some <VOCNOISE> but it's <SIL> not as extreme as some places that i've been <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> birmingham alabama <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> when i went i went with my friend <IVER>
<SIL> and <SIL> we were staying at his grandpa's and his grandpa would sit on the back porch <EXT-and> <SIL> say all kinds of racial slurs towards black <VOCNOISE-people> <IVER>
<IVER>
and everyone would be all right with that <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i think so <SIL> i mean there's enough open minded people in the country <IVER>
that i think that we would be ready <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean colin powell was pretty close if he would have ran <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i'd say it's not any different than having a man i mean <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> a person <SIL> she'd just have a different way of going about it <CUTOFF-clipping=the> <VOCNOISE> probably <SIL> <IVER>
i'd say probably the black man <IVER>
yeah well <SIL> the white man would probably win but the black man also <VOCNOISE> has a <VOCNOISE> he has a better chance than the woman i think <IVER>
simply <EXT-because> <SIL> it's not too much of a change from the status quo <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
i was too young <IVER>
no <IVER>
all of his problems have <EXT-been> personal problems that really shouldn't have been touched on <VOCNOISE> except the media got into it <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they weren't <SIL> that shocked that a president would do something like that 
they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it <SIL> and <SIL> pretty much <SIL> all the other problems <SIL> well there weren't really too many other problems i mean the economy's <SIL> doing really <LAUGH-well> and <SIL> foreign relations <SIL> are always shaky but <SIL> they're getting a little bit better <IVER>
i'd probably vote for bush <SIL> over clinton <SIL> <IVER>
i don't think that'd change my mind about anything i mean <SIL> i don't <SIL> approve of his immoral behavior but <VOCNOISE> it doesn't change the way he runs the country <IVER>
i'm just more of a conservative person i mean <SIL> i'm not sure exactly what his platform is <SIL> but i've seen him speak a couple <EXT-times> <SIL> and <SIL> i don't know he just <SIL> impresses me more than al gore <IVER>
al gore really doesn't entice me at all he claims he invented the internet <LAUGH> <IVER>
all this other stuff <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no it'd probably be <EXT-something> with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind <IVER>
<SIL> or some kind of tax program <IVER>
that would probably affect my decision a little bit <IVER>
because i worked with a guy that was a cocaine addict for a while <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <SIL> he couldn't have any kind of caffeine otherwise he'd get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills <IVER>
to help <SIL> calm him down <IVER>
and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right <IVER>
and that type of person i don't think would make a very effective president because <SIL> i don't know president needs to be able to think fast on their feet <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that would probably change my decision a little bit <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i don't think i could vote for a violent president <SIL> i could vote for a president that made some mistakes with <VOCNOISE> their personal life <IVER>
gun control <SIL> i'm not really too interested in <SIL> i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns in the street <SIL> big huge <EXT-guns and <SIL> they're one of the safest nations in the country <VOCNOISE> then you look at england they have no guns at all and they're <SIL> relatively safe <SIL> so i mean <IVER>
it's <SIL> more our society than the guns i believe it's more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself <IVER>
guns should definitely be kept in a lock box <SIL> where kids can't get them <SIL> besides that there's not a whole lot that <SIL> government can do it's more the parents' responsibility to keep the guns out of their <SIL> kids' hands <SIL> <IVER>
no the worst thing that happened was a wallet got stolen out of a locker <IVER>
yeah <SIL> pretty much <SIL> <IVER>
here at college i really haven't witnessed any violence at all <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i haven't seen any fights i haven't seen anyone get shot i mean you read about it in the lantern but <VOCNOISE> the only thing that i was really shocked about was <SIL> the people begging on high street <IVER>
yeah that's really not something you see in worthington <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> i agree that we should help them <SIL> maybe through some sort of government <SIL> program <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really doesn't motivate them to get out of the gutter <SIL> i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they're probably gonna stay with that because it's real easy life <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
it's about the same <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> they use drugs but not to the extreme <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <SIL> college students do <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
high school <SIL> marijuana <SIL> acid <SIL> mushrooms <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-error=that> i didn't know anybody in <VOCNOISE> high school but in college i know some people that have used <EXT-coke> <SIL> ecstasy <SIL> it was more after the movie go <SIL> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it was about a <SIL> bunch of teenage ravers <IVER>
and i mean <SIL> i don't think a lot of people have ever heard of ecstasy until that movie <IVER>
kind of <IVER>
it's like an advertisement for it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah i mean a lot of people really <VOCNOISE> that i knew anyway didn't know about ecstasy until they saw that movie and <EXT-then> <SIL> it was the whole talk <EXT-of> <SIL> high school whatever <SIL> <IVER>
there were a couple that would go to raves every now and then and use it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> downtown <VOCNOISE> abandoned warehouses that get rented out for a night <IVER>
<SIL> they're pretty much all underground things they have a web page up i'm not sure what the address is right now <SIL> <IVER>
no i've had friends go <VOCNOISE> i was gonna go to one on halloween but didn't <IVER>
not really at parties parties are usually just <SIL> mostly kegs <SIL> sometimes there's pot sometimes there's not <IVER>
usually <VOCNOISE> <SIL> every weekend <IVER>
mm-hmm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
they go to clubs <VOCNOISE> they go to bars clubs um raves <SIL> any place where there's dancing <IVER>
and there's lighting effects like strobe lights disco balls <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
not at all <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <VOCNOISE> parties didn't change at all <IVER>
no kids just think oh it can't happen to me i'm invincible <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he was recovered <SIL> uh he was about thirty four years old <IVER>
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but <SIL> it took him a while to catch on to things <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
there's a lot more in college college it's seven nights a week <IVER>
you can go anywhere <SIL> get something to drink <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
there's a mild fear it seems the cops always 
<SIL> girls <VOCNOISE> i've never seen them take a guy out of a bar <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm not sure <SIL> it's usually the girls look younger than guys i guess i don't know <IVER>
because they f always dress up and everything when they go to the bars <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> i mean the cops are just looking for people that look younger <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> they don't have time to go and look at the stamps on everyone's hands and <IVER>
check their i d's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> guys will drink at the bar girls usually drink before the bar <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> as is my experience <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> because the girls are afraid and paranoid of getting caught with <CUTOFF-clipping=another <SIL> with a container at the bar <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> the guys think it's macho or whatever to be able to buy beer <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah four nights a week sometimes <IVER>
<SIL> recently it's been like <SIL> saturdays <SIL> <IVER>
that's about it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
yeah because there's no fear of being caught by the parents <IVER>
there's no one to like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> check up on you <VOCNOISE> in your dorm room <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> you're pretty much in control of your life at this point <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't <IVER>
i don't really remember october if that <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i still had a three point two <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
first quarter <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i s <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i moved into the dorms <VOCNOISE> late september <VOCNOISE> last fall <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> me and my <CUTOFF-f=friends> <SIL> two or <VOCNOISE> two other of my roommates <VOCNOISE> <SIL> took a trip i went skydiving white water rafting and skydiving again right before we moved in <IVER>
like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> skydiving wednesday <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> white water rafting thursday and friday skydiving saturday move in sunday <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> the skydiving's <VOCNOISE> up by wooster <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> and then the white water rafting is down in west virginia on the new river <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and i'm trying to work on my license for skydiving though <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i really didn't start <SIL> drinking until probably <VOCNOISE> <SIL> early <VOCNOISE> or late last summer <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> right before college and then <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> couple times nothing really big <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i know a lot of my friends did but i didn't <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know how <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you would define it as serious at this point <SIL> because college is mostly binge drinking <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think the real problem comes when you start drinking alone and everyday <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> because i mean when your friends aren't around and there's no parties to go to you usually don't drink <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> i'd say my ex girlfriend <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she could drink more than i could <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> she'd sit <VOCNOISE> up in their room and drink alone sometimes <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
a little bit <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
her mom's a severe alcoholic <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'm still living in the dorms until this <SIL> wednesday <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> moving home for the summer <VOCNOISE> <SIL> working <VOCNOISE> <SIL> taking a summer class <IVER>
i'm <VOCNOISE> living in an apartment <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i knew <VOCNOISE> <SIL> two of them since i was real little <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
then the other one just <SIL> fit in really well <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> she lives two doors down <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i came back from working on my ceramics one night and she'd just gotten back from a party <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and she was talking in the hall with <VOCNOISE> my roommate <IVER>
and we went back to our room and we watched a movie and my roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just kind of hit it off from there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some kind of computer animation like at a video game <NOISE-company> <NOISE-or> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> at some sort of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> movie company like pixar or <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
something like that <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s-sweet> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> that's want <LAUGH-to> <LAUGH-do> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i've been playing video games since i was two <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just to get in the school <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's about <SIL> thirty people applying they let three in <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> to the art and tech department <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> you have to take a foundation of courses <IVER>
<SIL> which consists of <SIL> art one sixty two through art <SIL> two sixty <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> then you submit a portfolio in the fall for review <VOCNOISE> and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> they let three people in fall quarter <CUTOFF-clipping=unknown> three people in spring quarter <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> this fall's the first time i'll be submitting my portfolio <IVER>
definitely <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i have a <VOCNOISE> five hour course <SIL> the first term <VOCNOISE> of summer quarter <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and then i'm probably gonna be working on my portfolio the second term <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> my parents are all for it they've always been supportive of whatever <VOCNOISE> we wanted <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> my dad seems to think i should go on to law because <SIL> there's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> law in everything you can do anything with a law degree <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
no he doesn't have a problem with it at all <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh when i was a senior in high school i wish <SIL> my parents would've pushed me to do something practical but i'm glad they didn't <SIL> because it gave me a chance to make my own decision <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> well it would've been <VOCNOISE> <SIL> something that they would've supported and something that <SIL> i would've probably been pretty good at <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they would've made it so i wouldn't have had to make the decision <VOCNOISE> i mean that was <VOCNOISE> a hard decision to <LAUGH-make> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> thinking about journalism <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> design <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> graphic design in particular <VOCNOISE> <SIL> after i quit wrestling i got really into computers so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i pretty much live on my computer <LAUGH-now> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i'm on the computer at least six hours a day <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
not at all <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
you're talking to people all over the country and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean you're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> becoming more diversified because <VOCNOISE> you get <SIL> thoughts and opinions from people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> from all across the world and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and it's not just <VOCNOISE> like one group of people <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>

yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> media has a lot of control <VOCNOISE> over people <SIL> but <SIL> i believe that <SIL> sometimes people just need a kick like that <IVER>
to get them thinking about it <VOCNOISE> then they'll start to notice it in their life and <VOCNOISE> once they start noticing it they'll start <SIL> getting more and more into it <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no humans are violent by nature i believe <SIL> <SIL> mean <SIL> people have been at war since the beginning of man <SIL> <CUTOFF-it=its> <SIL> it's more or less greed that causes violence it's not <SIL> media <VOCNOISE> media <VOCNOISE> just like the ecstasy was <VOCNOISE> an advertisement showing what you could do <SIL> tv's <SIL> showing you violence that you <SIL> could do <VOCNOISE> if you're driven to it <VOCNOISE> 
<NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
okay one <SIL> two <SIL> three <SIL> four <SIL> five <SIL> testing <CUTOFF-testi=testing> <UNKNOWN> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> when i was a kid my father got this tape recorder <VOCNOISE> in the days when they were those big yknow the wheels <IVER>
<SIL> and god only knows he'd get a half a dozen drinks in him then he'd go around the house <VOCNOISE> testing testing say a few words for <CUTOFF-po=posterity?> and we used to think get him <SIL> out of here yknow <IVER>
i guess that's what it is but i don't have a video camera either but i as soon as you said that i thought i could just see him yknow oh <IVER>
drove me <CUTOFF-n_ah_tq=nuts> say a few words for posterity he'd say and we'd say <SIL> get out of here <IVER>
no <SIL> i i um <NOISE> <SIL> have very little contact with them and so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that'd be about the <LAUGH-last_thing_I'd_be_doing> <SIL> okay where are we <IVER>
i'll start asking you questions so that <IVER>
yeah okay <IVER>
uh <IVER>
eh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
convenient <LAUGH> <IVER>
in what way <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right right <SIL> tremendous demand right now <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
and you've been going to ohio state that whole time <IVER>
you should be getting pretty near <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> excuse me <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> i'm guessing <IVER>
is it <IVER>
right <IVER>
sounds good <IVER>
oh i yeah exactly <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i was just wondering how could i get a job doing what you're doing <NOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-g=grew> <SIL> grew up in masillon ohio i'm the oldest of five children i have four children my own <SIL> i'm uh <VOCNOISE> i was <SIL> <previ=previously> i was married many years ago <VOCNOISE> and then i've been married to my husband now for twenty one years <VOCNOISE> and we have um <SIL> three children together so i have a daughter <EXCLUDE-at> twenty eight <VOCNOISE> daughter at <SIL> nineteen who's a sophomore at ohio wesleyan my older daughter's a graduate from ohio <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm a graduate of <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> i have a son who's uh <CUTOFF-nin=nineteen> uh <EXCLUDE-let's> see joe is <SIL> he <SIL> fifteen he's a sophomore at <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> high school and i have an <SIL> eighth grade daughter <VOCNOISE> at <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> and um i'm a homemaker i have a degree in sociology <VOCNOISE> i've been at home since my <VOCNOISE> a second daughter was born <SIL> with my second marriage <VOCNOISE> and i consider it a luxury and a privilege and i just absolutely love <SIL> being at home i do a lot of volunteer work <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i'm real involved with the school system <SIL> <CUTOFF-C=Columbus?> with columbus public and uh <SIL> i like <SIL> organizing big projects for them um <SIL> my husband's director of engineering for liebert <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so that's why i know what you're thinking yeah and whenever i complain about the weather in columbus he always says we'll go anywhere you want <VOCNOISE> where would you like to live <VOCNOISE> well i wanna stay here i don't wanna go anywhere yet til all my kids are ready <SIL> and then my daughters always say <VOCNOISE> okay mom as soon as we're all done with school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> then we can all move to california but we have to go as a group because i'm real real close to to my children <IVER>
yeah really close <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i'm sure it makes it <SIL> easier <VOCNOISE> but i think that a person can establish a relationship <SIL> <HES-ey> you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working <VOCNOISE> yknow with my oldest daughter <VOCNOISE> i worked but i arranged my life around her so that <SIL> even though i had that degree i waited tables because when she was <SIL> little before she started school <VOCNOISE> i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her <SIL> was with her all day <VOCNOISE> then when she started school i switched over to lunches <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> so i've always arranged my life around my children <SIL> so i have an opportunity to be with them <IVER>
they get <SIL> better and better and better <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <CUTOFF-he=hear?> <IVER>
i'm i'm really lucky um <VOCNOISE> yknow everyone's always <SIL> crabbing about their horrible kids and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my kids are phenomenal <HES-a> we have this arrangement <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i do <SIL> everything i possibly can to make them happy <IVER>
and they do <SIL> everything they possibly can to make me happy <VOCNOISE> and it's like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> my my oldest girl she <CUTOFF-sh=she> <SIL> we're expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she and i see each other all the time my daughter who goes to <EXCLUDE-name> chose to live at home because she just said it was <SIL> just a better situation for her <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> it's not that these girls aren't independent and can't do it on their <CUTOFF-ow=own> <SIL> they're <SIL> megan could my second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was <VOCNOISE> twelve <SIL> i mean she's just a very very mature very driven <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the only problem she has she didn't have a job to support herself other than that she could have taken care of herself <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> <CUTOFF-sh-she> she chooses to <SIL> still at home and be a part of our life and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my son he's <SIL> both those kids have four points i mean they really work hard in school because they know it's important and my son was uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he was the only <CUTOFF-ti=time?> only one that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in seventh and eighth grade <SIL> he <SIL> took <SIL> that time to do the maturing that most of his friends are doing at sixteen and so i'm really lucky <VOCNOISE> that we had our <VOCNOISE> difficulty at that point <SIL> and uh <SIL> and it was minimal <SIL> but to me having been used to everything being perfect yknow <EXCLUDE-it> was like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was like for him to have <SIL> um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> for him to not make the honor roll every time i couldn't even imagine what was happening with him <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and now he's completely back on track and doing really well <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and my eighth grade daughter is um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my kids are involved in all kinds of different things she's real involved with theater <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um she's <VOCNOISE> yeah everything that comes along yknow she wins the science fair she <ERROR-get=get> does the power of the pen <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she <CUTOFF-k=?> is on student <CUTOFF-coun=council> they all have lots of <VOCNOISE> different kinds of things that they're involved in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that i'm incredibly proud of them because they're just <SIL> they're <SIL> and they're really <VOCNOISE> they're not geeky and goofy <SIL> they're really neat <IVER>
neat kids that kids like <IVER>
so <IVER>
they're <CUTOFF-v=?> they are they're wonderful everybody always says to me rachel i just don't know what you're doing will you come and take care of mine for me <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it's <SIL> it's the fact that i have a tremendous respect for my kids i mean i really value their opinions <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i treat them everybody says your mom's weird she talks to us strange it's because i talk to them like i talk to you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at at whatever age they are <SIL> yknow i don't <SIL> yeah i don't talk down to kids i <SIL> <IVER>
sure <IVER>
sure <IVER>
yeah over the years <SIL> we've had <SIL> situations like that <SIL> yknow a pregnancy here and there and things that people needed to get worked out or someone being worried about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i uh i <SIL> a <SIL> neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do with it and about it <SIL> so yeah but yknow i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-it's> it's <SIL> i'm just lucky i'm so lucky <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh i'm <CUTOFF-sh=sure> <SIL> i'm sure of the fact that my parents um <VOCNOISE> my mother tried <CUTOFF-real=really> tries really hard but my <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so that he insisted yknow he <CUTOFF-c=could> <SIL> he could <ERROR-t=drink> drink on the weekends and never miss <SIL> work etcetera <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah there was no problem <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> but the biggest problem is the fact that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he and i <VOCNOISE> i um <SIL> i i <CUTOFF-exp=expected> i've always expected to have some sort of a respect from them <SIL> and because <VOCNOISE> they always wanted me to grow up and be <SIL> independent and think for myself and so i'm exactly what they always said they wanted <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just that they can't <SIL> handle that <SIL> and so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in a lot of trouble about um the racial thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because uh i'm from a school where i was mostly <SIL> white students were <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> almost the minority it was a pretty even it's a very it's a low income neighborhood <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when i in seventh grade i remember going home and saying was everybody the same and being told well of course they are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i went to school and told everybody i was in love with danny flowers who happened to be black <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i got called into the office and they called in a social worker and they <SIL> i was punished i wasn't allowed to <SIL> uh i was grounded for the year <VOCNOISE> and they never called this kid in i <VOCNOISE> i then i thought this whole thing is so screwed up <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-wha=what's> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what's wrong with these people <VOCNOISE> they kept saying that they wanted to save this <ERROR-nithe=nice> white girl because i had so much potential and uh they weren't going to let me throw my life away like this so i was <SIL> yknow it's bizarre <VOCNOISE> and so i was always from that time on i decided these these people are all crazy <VOCNOISE> i'm never gonna i'm never gonna be like that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so i have a whole lot of different values from my <SIL> family <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> it's <SIL> real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger <VOCNOISE> <SIL> are willing to 
<SIL> go along with what my father thinks and says and if he <SIL> wants it a certain way why <SIL> you just don't question that and i just <SIL> don't do <SIL> that it's wrong <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> right <CUTOFF-h=he> <SIL> he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and not speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> please <SIL> <CUTOFF-Nanc=Nancy> <SIL> i changed my name when i went to college i just decided i'm out of here i'm everything's gone <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> she would say um nancy please just talk to your father just for <VOCNOISE> just for my sake <SIL> please <CUTOFF-ta=talk> <VOCNOISE> and i would think i'm the child here i shouldn't have to be the one to make peace in this family if he doesn't wanna talk to me <VOCNOISE> i don't need him i don't have to talk to him <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right yknow <IVER>
yeah yeah yeah i shouldn't have to do this <VOCNOISE> i'm not responsible for the happiness of this family <IVER>
and the fact that i recognized all that and couldn't wait to get out of there and when i was gone <SIL> i was gone <VOCNOISE> and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where <VOCNOISE> my <CUTOFF-fam=family> in fact i've been happy about them lately because <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i've well we've lived in our same house for twenty years <SIL> and my parents say they <VOCNOISE> live in florida they um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean they're not well to do by any means but they <ERROR-?> they're not lacking for anything <VOCNOISE> and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california <VOCNOISE> <SIL> twice a year <SIL> to <CUTOFF-s=spend> <SIL> they spend a week with my brother <SIL> etc etc and they come here a couple times a year <VOCNOISE> and they stay at my sister's house <SIL> they have only come to my home three times in twenty years <VOCNOISE> and that's because they don't wanna get off the freeway <SIL> they will drive through columbus <SIL> from <VOCNOISE> florida to go to visit people in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> akron and masillon and they stay in cincinnati and they stay in springfield with my sisters <SIL> and they won't do it because <SIL> it's just to <CUTOFF-mu=much> they don't wanna have to <VOCNOISE> deal with that traffic <SIL> they don't like that <SIL> and it's <SIL> and just recently i finally said <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i don't understand why you can't do that yknow i've actually called them <UNKNOWN> i'm fifty two <IVER>
you would think by now yknow <SIL> this wouldn't matter <IVER>
and my youngest daughter when i was <SIL> crabbing about it because i said i talked to them and they said well we're coming to ohio in a couple weeks and i said <VOCNOISE> oh good are you gonna come and see us <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well no we weren't <SIL> we weren't planning on it and i said well why <VOCNOISE> well we're we're not driving uh doty's renting us the car <SIL> well <SIL> all that meant was my sister was renting the car <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> he was driving the car <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> i said well well well then how are you gonna get to these other places <SIL> and normally i wouldn't do that i would just <VOCNOISE> let it go <VOCNOISE> well uh uh uh doty's renting that car and i said well are you <SIL> aren't you driving it <SIL> well well yeah but and i said <SIL> fine <SIL> and i don't wanna even think about it <SIL> so it's kind of like <IVER>
it's just bizarre <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
and why what <HES-he> <HES-he's> he's too busy <IVER>
yeah he doesn't have the <CUTOFF-ti=time> mine don't have the time <IVER>
but they <VOCNOISE> but then in the very next breath they said <SIL> well in two weeks we're going to california to visit paul <SIL> now <VOCNOISE> now <VOCNOISE> and anyhow i was telling each of my children because i was upset and i was telling them this <SIL> and they're all going oh mom <CUTOFF-yknow> my older girls are going oh yknow <SIL> and my <SIL> my <SIL> daughter who's thirteen is <SIL> fabulous she is so blunt <SIL> she is such <SIL> she's just so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> out there and so <SIL> different from so many other children <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and she said well do you actually care if he comes here <SIL> you don't care do you and i said <VOCNOISE> well i don't care but it makes me feel bad it hurts my feelings <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> i should know <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-s=?> <IVER>
i don't really care why should i <VOCNOISE> yeah but it's but you still just think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because i'm thinking too <VOCNOISE> so what happens when they die <VOCNOISE> am i gonna be feeling bad that this and i <VOCNOISE> but i can't my sister said look yknow you're not gonna change <SIL> and i'm not <VOCNOISE> the reason he won't come to my house is because when he goes to their house <VOCNOISE> everything changes <VOCNOISE> they have to have dinner <SIL> at ten o clock in the morning <VOCNOISE> we're not doing that <VOCNOISE> we're gonna compromise and we'll do it at one o <CUTOFF-clo=clock> we'll do it at noon <SIL> we have dinner at <SIL> seven o clock <SIL> at night right we'll do it at noon <SIL> i'm not doing it at ten o clock in the <CUTOFF-mor=morning> <SIL> i don't <SIL> care <VOCNOISE> and there's no compromise with him <VOCNOISE> you have <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
whatever you want sure <IVER>
right so they don't come see me and i guess i shouldn't care because i <VOCNOISE> i would just like them <VOCNOISE> actually what i'd like them is come for about twenty minutes so they can see this wonderful home we have <VOCNOISE> that's all i care about i just wanna show it off <IVER>
yknow it's like <VOCNOISE> look <VOCNOISE> you always think i could <VOCNOISE> yknow look i'm doing really well look how wonderful everything is <IVER>
and wouldn't you like them to see that <VOCNOISE> yknow look <IVER>
i <CUTOFF-re=really?> really and it's bizarre <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>

yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i know <VOCNOISE> i know <VOCNOISE> i know <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> i sort <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well that's just it that's part of it because like i <SIL> see my parents wouldn't come my mother used to try to come to things at school when i would <SIL> be <SIL> in different things <VOCNOISE> and and i really did <CUTOFF-apprec=appreciate> but my father would not he just <CUTOFF-wou=wouldn't?> <VOCNOISE> she'd say well you know <VOCNOISE> he just doesn't like that kind of thing <SIL> i mean i would be in the sunny spelling bee i would be in the <VOCNOISE> he he doesn't <VOCNOISE> well too damn bad get your butt down there and pretend like you like it <VOCNOISE> and so yknow with our <CUTOFF-fa=family> and my husband's the same way his family was <CUTOFF-exa=exactly> <SIL> his father died when he was <SIL> nine <VOCNOISE> he was like the adult in his family he came from a <SIL> buffalo new york <SIL> working class <VOCNOISE> he left he never looked back either <VOCNOISE> and so it's kind of like he and i are <CUTOFF-bo=both> <VOCNOISE> people always <SIL> they <SIL> say yknow <VOCNOISE> how we're such <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i don't know we get a <VOCNOISE> the schools are always so grateful to <SIL> us because <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> we organized the state chess tournaments he started the baseball league for this building yknow he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it's simply because <VOCNOISE> we're so grateful to have this family to be able to be a <SIL> part of these kids' lives <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> to go to <CUTOFF-e=everything?> i mean he coaches baseball he coaches <VOCNOISE> yknow um basketball <SIL> we don't miss anything yknow it doesn't matter what it is <IVER>
we're <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> we wanna be because it's a privilege <VOCNOISE> not because <VOCNOISE> oh i gotta go to another play <VOCNOISE> yknow my daughter just did a play downtown with columbus junior theater <SIL> and <SIL> i ushered at eighteen performances <SIL> because i could see it free <SIL> i <ERROR-k-d=?> i didn't wanna pay ten bucks every time to see it but if i ushered <SIL> i could be in the audience every time <VOCNOISE> yknow and for my parents to have no interest in seeing <VOCNOISE> seeing <EXCLUDE-name> play baseball or <EXCLUDE-name> swims for ohio wesleyan yknow or <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> in a play <SIL> they they wouldn't they don't even wanna be bothered with that that's just to them it's just <SIL> and i can't understand that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh it'll be <IVER>
sure <IVER>
sure <IVER>
yeah exactly <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
uh huh <IVER>
timer <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh huh <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i know oh it gives me goose bumps it's such a shame <IVER>
i know and isn't it amazing <SIL> and <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i know <SIL> and yknow and the thing is you're gonna have a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a great time with your kids and it's just <VOCNOISE> it's it's <SIL> it's almost like <VOCNOISE> if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have it like this it's worth it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
it's just <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it's just <SIL> wonderful i know like saturday we're gonna drive to oberlin to watch <EXCLUDE-name> swim two events <SIL> and come back <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> yeah she says mom i'm only gonna be in the water five minutes total why are you guys driving to oberlin ohio for this <VOCNOISE> because we wouldn't miss it there'll be a time when we <CUTOFF-c=?> well you know she won't be doing those things <SIL> so it's <SIL> it's just important and it's <VOCNOISE> wonderful and i just think it's just such an opportunity i'm so lucky to be able to do that <VOCNOISE> see now like my husband <SIL> i'm eleven years older than he is 
so when we got married <SIL> we had to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we were we were together a year we were engaged a year and we knew we <VOCNOISE> soon as he finished school <VOCNOISE> we were getting um within three months <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we got married bought a house was pregnant with megan <IVER>
and it's just like been <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for him too uh this has been yknow uh <SIL> uh a real <HES-amazing> road because by the time he was twenty eight he had four kids <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and yet yknow we managed to to work through all that together and be with these kids and have this this kind of time we have now he's looking forward to <VOCNOISE> he's thrilled about the <CUTOFF-dau=daughter> the baby that my daughter's gonna have <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> i would have had a whole lot more kids yknow i would have just kept having them and <VOCNOISE> he said oh four's plenty yknow he needed a break <IVER>
<SIL> so <IVER>
now i'd be taking in foster <CUTOFF-ki=kids> i <CUTOFF-too=took> i raised a little boy from the time he was born till he was six well he was my friend's <VOCNOISE> she's a single woman and she wanted to <CUTOFF-a=adopt> <SIL> <EXT-adopt> but she said she wouldn't adopt <VOCNOISE> if she <CUTOFF-wou=would?> he was gonna have to <CUTOFF-g=go> a child would have to go to day care <VOCNOISE> and this was when my daughter was started kindergarten and i said <VOCNOISE> if you get a baby <SIL> i'll take care of him til he starts school <IVER>
and that's what we did <VOCNOISE> and so he's just like my own too now i go and volunteer at he's in kindergarten i go and volunteer in his classroom too so it's kind of like <SIL> i hope i get to do this forever <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh i think it <SIL> i would do it in a minute but my family doesn't want it they all <VOCNOISE> my husband thinks we're fine he doesn't want anymore around <VOCNOISE> and all my kids are so used to all their own <IVER>
uh they say <SIL> oh no we don't want <SIL> or i'd say let's get a foreign exchange student this would be fun <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
they say <IVER>
no mom we don't wanna do that because they don't wanna have to be responsible for them <SIL> at school and wherever <IVER>
so <IVER>
i don't know but if everybody's ever gone i'm gonna i'll <SIL> i'll <SIL> find some i'm sure <IVER>
i'm i'm gonna keep doing the same stuff yknow i'll find some other kid somewhere else and i'll have some time yknow my husband and i'll have time together and <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i always find some i always have a project <SIL> yknow it's like <VOCNOISE> i'm always saying <VOCNOISE> well when things slow down around here i'm gonna like right now i should be home counting money for the <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-r=raise> i did a fundraiser for the the school <HES-and> we <SIL> raised um <VOCNOISE> we just sell <SIL> uh morley candy and wrapping paper and all that kind of stuff <VOCNOISE> and our sales are anywhere from twenty five thousand to forty thousand dollars and so we get half of that for the profit and i do that sale myself but that also means <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> i have thousands and thousands of dollars to sort through and reconcile <VOCNOISE> so but anyhow i'm always saying when it slows down but then i always will find another project <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> and i <SIL> rehab houses <SIL> whenever i get a chance i like to do that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <IVER>
<CUTOFF-the=there'll> <CUTOFF-there'll> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
no <HES-well> <SIL> it's like <VOCNOISE> you buy it and then you'd get to do the shopping the fun part you go out pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that and then you have somebody else do that <LAUGH-part> <LAUGH> but i don't do like <SIL> major <VOCNOISE> gutting or anything <SIL> i just <SIL> like to get something that needs <VOCNOISE> that that that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous <SIL> if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah <VOCNOISE> so that's the kind stuff and i've only done three or four of them but it's fun <IVER>
because i've always liked to fix up <CUTOFF-hou=houses> <SIL> my own house <IVER>
yeah <UNKNOWN-you_can_just> yeah it's fun <IVER>
uh huh <SIL> uh huh <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
too much <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
that's what you want <IVER>
yep <IVER>
yep <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
isn't that fun <IVER>
oh i know it's so much fun <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i just like doing it and <VOCNOISE> i have a good set i my <HES-my> best friend is a realtor uh she's since retired but <VOCNOISE> it's so funny because she would always go through <HES-all> these <SIL> statistics and this and that because it the stuff i've done is in <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and because i live in <EXCLUDE-name> area <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> she would say oh i don't know and she'd say well how much do you have to get it for and how much should <VOCNOISE> and i would say <VOCNOISE> oh i don't know i think if i get it for under a hundred and five i probably can sell it for a hundred and forty if i do this this this and this <SIL> now you're gonna put a lot of money into that though it's not like you're you're still only gonna make maybe ten thousand dollars profit <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> and she would say <VOCNOISE> well i don't know and for a long time she was always real skeptical because i would just like make up these numbers or just have this idea <VOCNOISE> and finally she says oh well rachel <VOCNOISE> i don't know it always works out for you you always get that so just <SIL> do it and it's just some <SIL> intuition kind of thing <IVER>
but it's fun <IVER>
uh huh me too years ago <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i know that's <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i <LAUGH-know> <IVER>
it's so funny that's what my daughters i do we're <CUTOFF-goi=going??> then we're always looking and saying <VOCNOISE> hmm there could do this this this this <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> and plus <IVER>
it is and plus the thing is too like when we bought our house we had looked for <SIL> months and months and months and i wanted an old house <VOCNOISE> it was built like nineteen seventeen <VOCNOISE> i wanted an old house that hadn't been <VOCNOISE> kept up <IVER>
yeah the same thing you were talking about and uh we're only the third people to live in it <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> it needed <SIL> everything yknow and it had gold <CUTOFF-carp+carpet> now gold's back but in those days everything was like gold and yknow and <VOCNOISE> green it was horrible <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> it was great fun <SIL> we had <SIL> we had lot fun we <VOCNOISE> we took the back porch and made it part of the kitchen and had another back porch put on uh <VOCNOISE> finished the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put an in ground pool and <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i always joke because what i paid for it <VOCNOISE> i now owe three times that amount <SIL> on it <IVER>
but it's because <SIL> most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage <SIL> so it's just that kind of thing <IVER>
if you have specific questions we're never get to them <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
ok <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it <CUTOFF-to=took> it only took um the last one i did was on richards road which is right across from whetstone park <IVER>
and <SIL> it only took <SIL> um <SIL> less than two months <IVER>
yeah and i had sold within <CUTOFF-si=six??> <VOCNOISE> well i waited i knew that what had to have happen on the outside which is really only some paint uh <SIL> minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and <VOCNOISE> cleaning up the front yard and then we have <VOCNOISE> there's a guy who works for me who's um <VOCNOISE> i just don't know how he can <CUTOFF-a=afford?> how he makes a living because he's very very reasonable he's also very loyal to me he's done stuff for me for years <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> and he's not that old he's probably <SIL> he's <SIL> twenty eight or twenty nine now but anyhow pat went in <VOCNOISE> we added a bathroom there was a mud room we added a half bath off the kitchen and <SIL> we put in the uh changed the back door and put in the deck and <VOCNOISE> he did those kinds of things <SIL> and <SIL> yknow and then we were ready to go and i said i was gonna sell it myself and everybody said i was crazy <VOCNOISE> and i had an open house <SIL> and i sold it that day i had thirty i had <SIL> like thirty some people in i got my offer that afternoon i got what i wanted <VOCNOISE> well i didn't get immediately <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> the realtors told me i should ask a hundred thirty four and i asked a hundred forty six instead because i really <SIL> felt <SIL> i <CUTOFF-kn=knew?> <VOCNOISE> i knew that this was nice house and i knew it had beautiful hardwood floors built in bookcases <VOCNOISE> and i just knew that <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> that i could've seen me wanting that house and do you know what i mean it's like that identity thing <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> somebody came through and they <SIL> uh with a realtor and they made me this <SIL> offer that was real low it was like a hundred and thirty <SIL> eight <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> the the realtor it's i'm thinking about it because was funny he delivered the offer to my home and i was gracious and i thanked him and i got inside and i opened up and i <SIL> saw it <SIL> and i went running out a porch i say <VOCNOISE> wait a minute <VOCNOISE> this is <VOCNOISE> never gonna work <IVER>
i said this will never work <SIL> i'm not interested take it back <VOCNOISE> and he said <VOCNOISE> no no no just <VOCNOISE> let's just work with us just work with us we'll we'll take care of this <VOCNOISE> so i ended up selling to him for hundred and forty four <VOCNOISE> but it was just funny because i thought <VOCNOISE> he <SIL> i thought <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they're never gonna get to where i have to be and we're not even gonna play this game back and forth <IVER>
so and it was fun and i <SIL> i made uh we made about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> nine thousand on it by the time we were done <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um i <SIL> i um <SIL> i do all of our own taxes i really <SIL> i keep thinking i must be doing it wrong because it's not that hard everybody acts like oh this is such a big deal <IVER>
you just get the booklets <SIL> you call you <SIL> ask the questions <IVER>
yeah and you read it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah exactly i know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
really <IVER>
yeah exactly <IVER>
excuse me <IVER>
all you do is you just keep your records of <HES-of> um <SIL> yknow <SIL> what you spend on things <SIL> and then there's a form you fill out and how much <VOCNOISE> you have if you've taken any depreciation yknow you need to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> basically put that back in <VOCNOISE> and deduct your costs <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then there's the percentage that goes on your schedule e that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income <VOCNOISE> and then it's just taxed <SIL> it's just not it's really not that hard <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it i <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know how to tell you that um <VOCNOISE> i mean it it 
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> yknow it <VOCNOISE> because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i'm sure <SIL> i'm sure that i didn't pay more than three thousand on it <SIL> and <SIL> it <SIL> yknow it didn't cost me more than three thousand and so <VOCNOISE> if i had five or six thousand dollars out of it i was happy <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE-sure> <CUTOFF-ah=I> i mean that's <VOCNOISE> that's a lot of money for having a good <VOCNOISE-time> yknow <IVER>
so i almost bought one <VOCNOISE> um uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-bla=about> couple weeks ago <VOCNOISE> in fact i went <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i went into contract on it with this guy <VOCNOISE> this dear old man whose it was for his mother who was in her nineties in a retirement home was on royal forest <SIL> which is north <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i made this <SIL> this low offer and i never thought that they would <SIL> i didn't want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i <SIL> if i was gonna get this house i should get it <VOCNOISE> but i didn't really want now because of the baby coming and we're gonna be busy and i didn't wanna get involved in <VOCNOISE> and so i made this offer and then he <VOCNOISE-countered> back yknow i offered him ninety <EXT-two> <VOCNOISE> and he was asking ninety nine nine <VOCNOISE> so he countered back at ninety six and i said that <SIL> and yknow i thought well good now i don't worry about he's never gonna come to it <VOCNOISE> so i wrote back and said yknow <VOCNOISE> i appreciate your offer but <VOCNOISE> ninety two <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was <SIL> really the only thing i could <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> i could do <VOCNOISE> and i didn't even give him a time to respond because i just just assumed i was just <NOISE> <SIL> bowing out of it <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> checked my fax machine the next day it says <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my mother has decided accept your offer and i thought <VOCNOISE> shit i don't <LAUGH-this_one> what am i gonna do now so <VOCNOISE> i ended up talking him and i <VOCNOISE> i just explained to him that <VOCNOISE> um he'd caught me off guard and that i had more time to reconsider it <SIL> and that because of <SIL> and it's true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said that that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was <SIL> just <SIL> not gonna work <SIL> for me <VOCNOISE> he's a nice man i <SIL> felt bad <SIL> and so then i gave him <VOCNOISE-some> ideas about how he could sell it <IVER>
to help him <SIL> <IVER>
well i always assume you'd be running it that whole time <IVER>
i mean i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
see <VOCNOISE> the thing is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ideally <SIL> i would rather if i were gonna buy house in clintonville to hold them and rent them <VOCNOISE> my problem is <SIL> i don't have any money so <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> that down <VOCNOISE-payment> <SIL> has to be ten percent down <SIL> and so that means that i would have that tied up <SIL> while it was being rented <VOCNOISE> like we bought a couple condos over on bethel road <VOCNOISE> it's for my kids to live in so that my oldest girl when she's getting ready to move out she's like <SIL> twenty four <VOCNOISE> and <CUTOFF-sh=she> they couldn't find any place to live that i thought was <VOCNOISE> that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-so> i finally decided well <VOCNOISE> we'll find something and i'll buy and i'll be your land lady and then what'll it'll be nice <SIL> and so <VOCNOISE> i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to <VOCNOISE> was thinking she was gonna move out when she graduated from high school <VOCNOISE> and changed her mind so i just rented that one but it the bottom line is <SIL> i <SIL> i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work <SIL> with that helped me <VOCNOISE> buy those without any money <VOCNOISE> i didn't have a down payment i had nothing <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> so it's like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent <SIL> just makes the payment <VOCNOISE> but the other you would <SIL> you would be fine you be renting it you wouldn't buy anything that you didn't think you could rent <SIL> and come out even with <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> it's gotta be hard if you haven't <VOCNOISE> had other projects <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh huh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
wow <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> you're <IVER>
right <IVER>

<EXT-yeah> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh i know <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
that's exactly how i am when you said what would i do yknow i might do house i might do <CUTOFF-s=school> go to school some i used to own a gallery i might do something like that again <VOCNOISE> yknow there's just like <VOCNOISE> there's just zillions of projects out there waiting to happen and so it's just <IVER>
it was <SIL> we had a little gallery um <SIL> we were in clintonville for a <SIL> a year or so and then we moved to grandview <VOCNOISE> and it was just fine art <SIL> we called it fine art <VOCNOISE> crafts <SIL> and it was handmaid stuff from local <VOCNOISE-people> and we had lot of jewelry and pottery and <VOCNOISE> silk <VOCNOISE> and paintings that kind stuff <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-and> it was it was fun <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i met a lot of neat <VOCNOISE-people> <VOCNOISE> in fact that's where i met the woman whose child i took care of she was one the artists who came to me <VOCNOISE> <Hes-and> <VOCNOISE> it but it was not <VOCNOISE> nobody was gonna make any money on it <SIL> and it was the kind of thing that <VOCNOISE> it was a project i started it when my youngest daughter started kindergarten because i needed a new project <VOCNOISE> and i didn't know <VOCNOISE> anything about it <SIL> i'd never even been in a gallery <VOCNOISE> i thought <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> this'll be fun <VOCNOISE> i'll just rent this space because i found this space and i was trying think of something i could do with it <VOCNOISE> so i thought well i'll rent this space <VOCNOISE> <EXT-and> then ah <SIL> i know what i'll do <SIL> i'll just put an ad in the paper and i'll find a bunch of artists and then i'll set this business up <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> and it was consignment so i didn't needed that money i just needed rent <SIL> and we had art classes and that was fun <VOCNOISE> and so <SIL> once i got that whole thing all set up and all ready to go <VOCNOISE> it's not nearly as interesting once yknow you <SIL> i like i like to make it <EXT-happen> <VOCNOISE> i'm not really <VOCNOISE> interested in just sitting there day after day waiting for somebody to come <EXT-in> and so <SIL> when the lease was up on high street i was gonna get rid of it <VOCNOISE> and a couple people came to me that were artists there and said <VOCNOISE> could we <VOCNOISE-please> yknow would you consider having some partners <VOCNOISE> and i said sure if you guys are willing to come and sit in this place and i don't come sit here so we moved to grandview <VOCNOISE> and it was doing <UNKNOWN> <SIL> much better over there <SIL> <EXT-and> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> then the <VOCNOISE-same_thing> happened <VOCNOISE> <EXT-the> attorneys who were next door to us decided they wanted our space and when our lease <SIL> was up <SIL> they had more money than we did so <VOCNOISE> we were gonna have to move <EXT-again> and i just said <SIL> this is not worth it <SIL> and <VOCNOISE-besides> that i was ready that was about <VOCNOISE> three four years into it <VOCNOISE> i was ready to do <VOCNOISE-something> else <SIL> and i had already started taking care of jesse then so <VOCNOISE> i used to take him down to the gallery with me and i had a little bassinet in the <EXT-back> and <VOCNOISE> people <VOCNOISE-say_is_that> a baby <LAUGH> <IVER>

right <IVER>
<CUTOFF-exa=exactly> <IVER>
right <SIL> and then they wonder <CUTOFF-wha=why> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow i don't know <VOCNOISE-what's> <VOCNOISE-happened> it's the other <VOCNOISE-person> who's changed yknow and if you <HES-if> you start <SIL> <VOCNOISE-changing> your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way <SIL> that old golden rule thing <VOCNOISE> if you if you give out what you want back you get it <SIL> <IVER>
it sure works for me <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-I_can't_see_it> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
uh huh <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh what are you doing that for oh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that's funny <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well see <VOCNOISE> we have real traditional <SIL> um <SIL> break down of <CUTOFF-t=?> of chores but only because <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-tha=that's> that's just happened to be <SIL> what we like to the way we like it do you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> and it's it's not <SIL> um <SIL> because <SIL> yknow i consider our <SIL> my whole house a lot of feminists yknow we're all real strong about that but the thing is <VOCNOISE> since i have the luxury of being at home <VOCNOISE> and peter <HES-is> doing a job that <VOCNOISE-he> really enjoys <VOCNOISE> and i am doing something i enjoy <VOCNOISE> i really am happy to do <VOCNOISE> all of those things that typically women do <VOCNOISE> because <NOISE> that's my job that's my trade off yknow i don't have to go someplace else i can get <VOCNOISE> i can go and have coffee everyday with my daughters i can go <CUTOFF-sh=shopping?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=yknow?> do whatever i want <VOCNOISE> and i'm happy to do these other things <IVER>
and so <VOCNOISE> yknow even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown <VOCNOISE> it's not <VOCNOISE> it's not because i <VOCNOISE-have> to <SIL> it's not because he yknow he wouldn't do something that that something else <SIL> it's <SIL> this suits me fine <IVER>
and so that's a whole different that's real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same <IVER>
right which is what we look like <IVER>
but it's not <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
<CUTOFF-e=exactly> <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
i <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's another thing that <SIL> that <SIL> we're i'm at odds with with my <VOCNOISE-parents> were that they don't understand the fact that why would i go to college <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE-paid> for it myself <SIL> i worked my way through school <VOCNOISE> i was so proud the fact that i was like only a quarter late <SIL> <UNKNOWN> than my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was paying for it <SIL> as i went <VOCNOISE> and and i didn't have any loans i was when i was done it was <VOCNOISE-paid> for <VOCNOISE> and so um <VOCNOISE> course tuition was a hundred twenty five dollars a quarter but i was only making yknow fifty cents an hour at the beverly across the street on neil avenue <VOCNOISE> so um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh but <VOCNOISE-but> anyhow yknow they <VOCNOISE-could> never understand yknow well you <CUTOFF-di=didn't <SIL> you never got a job with it <SIL> yknow why would you go to school and waste all that money <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-=I> <SIL> i it was the best money i ever spent <IVER>
i don't <CUTOFF-under=understand> i mean and <SIL> it was my money <LAUGH-so> why should it matter <IVER>
right <SIL> well why do you have to do <SIL> anything with it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right but still <VOCNOISE> my <CUTOFF-j=name_Julie?> my oldest daughter were for a long time she was <ERROR-ith=in <SIL> in <VOCNOISE-theater> <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE-people> would say to me how do you feel about that and i said what do you mean how i feel about that <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> she can always wait tables as long as she can <VOCNOISE-support> herself <VOCNOISE> self what do i care <VOCNOISE> and then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology <VOCNOISE> and now as it turns out she's going to um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she just started back she's the one that's having the baby though <VOCNOISE> she's just started back <CUTOFF-t=to> and uh <SIL> to get certified to teach elementary <SIL> school because we've <VOCNOISE> talked so much about <SIL> what <CUTOFF-whe=where?> where would she do well and she <VOCNOISE> she would just do so well she's really good <CUTOFF-wi=with> she's such a <VOCNOISE-kid> herself she's really good with with kids maybe second third grade she's so into animals and so into <VOCNOISE> science and understands different kids <VOCNOISE> so that <SIL> yknow i <VOCNOISE> i think she would be fabulous there <VOCNOISE> and so she's kind of decided <CUTOFF-i=if?> but if that if she <CUTOFF-j=just?> ends up not doing that <SIL> i won't care either <IVER>
well we don't wanna know she's the only one that wants to know her her um boyfriend <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-he> doesn't wanna know either and so sara decided that she could not go <VOCNOISE> and find out the sex of it because she couldn't keep a secret yeah so <VOCNOISE> so anyhow we don't we just don't know <IVER>
it's due december second but she's already dilating and everything so the doctor had said before thanksgiving he thinks yknow <IVER>
we're excited <SIL> it'll be fun <IVER>
in any pregnancy three weeks in either direction is considered full term <IVER>

and it's she's kind of big chested she's my height <VOCNOISE> but the baby is like all <CUTOFF-undern=underneath> you don't <VOCNOISE-see> it <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> unless you push her shirt down <IVER>
it's just like it's <SIL> it's just amazing to me to be that pregnant and not be able to even hardly look like it <IVER>
so <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh really <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah a little yeah it's just amazing when she went to her lamas class she said <VOCNOISE> mom you wouldn't believe it <VOCNOISE> half these uh they <VOCNOISE-couldn't> get up off the floor or anything they were all having trouble and she said there i was with my cupcakes and my cheetohs yknow and she said they all had bottled water and were very yknow <VOCNOISE> but she's <VOCNOISE> like i said she just turned twenty eight she's <SIL> so <IVER>
i don't know i she doesn't move anymore than she has to i'm the one that loves to exercise <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh i do some yoga <SIL> and i do some <SIL> some weights <SIL> and i have a stepper <SIL> that i absolutely love i can <NOISE> i have it down now so i can 
<VOCNOISE> listen to music <IVER>
read the paper <VOCNOISE> and have the tv on if there's something i think i might wanna <CUTOFF-m=might> <VOCNOISE> i might be interested in so i just <SIL> do all those things and <VOCNOISE> do my machine <IVER>
uh just at home <VOCNOISE> i just have a tape that i use it's kathy smith <VOCNOISE> one of her <VOCNOISE> things that i really like <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
where do you do the aerobics <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
really <IVER>
i think that step would be really fun i've never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me <IVER>
really <IVER>
wow <CUTOFF-yi-you> <VOCNOISE> yeah i know <IVER>
well i <VOCNOISE> believe me i know <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
my <CUTOFF-frie=friend> <IVER>
yeah because my friend has some place where she even teaches yoga and has she's real involved in it <VOCNOISE> that she goes to um <VOCNOISE> the one that i told you who's the realtor <VOCNOISE> but i should find out <LAUGH-where> that <LAUGH-studio_is> if i find out i'll let you know <VOCNOISE> because i know she <VOCNOISE> she goes to some place called crapala in pennsylvania from time to time and <VOCNOISE> who knows <VOCNOISE> i just <VOCNOISE> i don't really do it for the meditation or anything <IVER>
i just do it for the stretching it's almost like when i'm laying there and <CUTOFF-sh=she?> and kathy's saying <VOCNOISE> yknow take <SIL> even though i sound speedy <IVER>
i'm really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem yknow and so for me that's like <VOCNOISE> okay come on <VOCNOISE> i don't really want i don't want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff <VOCNOISE> i just wanna get going and do the rest of this <LAUGH-stuff> so <IVER>
the part of it no <VOCNOISE> its takes about fifty minutes but to do all the stretching <IVER>
because see <VOCNOISE> well i've had five babies yknow i really have to work when you talked about that <VOCNOISE> the older you get <VOCNOISE> i have to work <EXT-really> really hard to <VOCNOISE> stay in halfway decent shape <IVER>
so <IVER>
but i love it <IVER>
<CUTOFF-a=I> yeah i think it does <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> i like to exercise <VOCNOISE> i think it's fun i would just do it four hours a day if i could do that <VOCNOISE> although i haven't for the last <VOCNOISE> six weeks i haven't done anything because it's just i've had these other things that are <CUTOFF-r=really?> <VOCNOISE> that are really pressing <VOCNOISE> you know how that is you get you have some things you just have to get done <VOCNOISE> and then when i get this stuff cleared out <SIL> there'll be a break <SIL> and then i'll be able to go back to it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh wow <IVER>
that must be <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
now who does he work for <IVER>
oh <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> well i was because i was gonna say when you were talking about traveling <VOCNOISE> you'll be able to get him to have <CUTOFF-s <VOCNOISE> a job where he can do lots of traveling <VOCNOISE> i know um like my husband goes to europe and <VOCNOISE> goes yknow he goes to california every month <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow he goes as <VOCNOISE> little as possible <VOCNOISE> but the point is <VOCNOISE> if i <CUTOFF-w=wanted> <VOCNOISE> if we wanted to be traveling <VOCNOISE> he could be going a lot more <VOCNOISE> a lot longer now he just goes for <VOCNOISE> yknow a couple days <VOCNOISE> at a time just to get back here because i don't like him to have to <CUTOFF-ge=go?> well and he doesn't wanna be away from us <VOCNOISE> but <ERROR-y=your> <VOCNOISE> your husband you'll be in a position you can he can latch on to something where you'll be able to have lots of opportunities to travel <IVER>
you will <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
it is it's <IVER>
right <IVER>
well i know with myself when we had <VOCNOISE> pete always says that <VOCNOISE> it wasn't for me he would have gotten just too immersed in his job because he is really involved yknow he likes what he's doing <VOCNOISE> he has tremendous responsibility and <VOCNOISE> but he loves it but the thing is <VOCNOISE> when the <ERROR-kidth=kids> were little too yknow i was always having to pull him back and say <SIL> don't forget <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> they're gonna grow up fast if you if you don't spend this time <VOCNOISE> and now <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> like i said the youngest is thirteen and so he's been at this for all these years and <VOCNOISE> i don't have to do that anymore i mean <VOCNOISE> someplace along the way about ten years ago <VOCNOISE> he got so involved in their lives but when they're little <IVER>
it's a real different thing i mean you can understand why <VOCNOISE> it'd be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours <EXT-when> yknow you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on but <VOCNOISE> he used to always <VOCNOISE> he would come home from work <VOCNOISE> and then go back to work after they were in bed <SIL> so that i wouldn't have to deal with it the whole time <IVER>
and work later then <VOCNOISE> which was fine by me <VOCNOISE> or he'd call and he'd say <VOCNOISE> is it okay if i work a little late <CUTOFF-toni=tonight> would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that <IVER>
wouldn't even think about asking <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
sure <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> oh and i've <VOCNOISE> and i'm sure it will <VOCNOISE> especially when you already recognize that <VOCNOISE> yknow <ERROR-i=if> if if you already know in advance what kinds of things you're gonna be <SIL> uh helping along it's a lot easier than <SIL> trying to figure out what's going on here yknow <IVER>
uh huh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
right <IVER>
uh <IVER>
i <VOCNOISE> that's certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain <SIL> doesn't <LAUGH-work_in_ways_that_other> people's do <VOCNOISE> so i think <CUTOFF-so=some> <VOCNOISE> i think a lot of it too has to <VOCNOISE> to <VOCNOISE> do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean i've gotten so much better over the years i was very <VOCNOISE> i've always been real <SIL> <CUTOFF-l=lot> <VOCNOISE> lot more temperamental <VOCNOISE> we always joke yknow that <SIL> that predictable and <VOCNOISE> some of those things are not <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> even tempered are not things you would use to describe me <UNKNOWN> but <VOCNOISE> but <CUTOFF-n=not> not in a negative <VOCNOISE> negative way yknow i just think that as i've gotten older too i've been able to see things and not be so <VOCNOISE> get so concerned about things that <VOCNOISE> that really weren't that important anymore <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> i don't know just lucky <LAUGH> <IVER>
i know i was thinking that before when you were telling me stuff <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i <CUTOFF-do=don't> i yknow i think too i apologize to my oldest daughter <SIL> <LAUGH-almost> every day about the poor thing all i put her through when <VOCNOISE> we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i wasn't a child <VOCNOISE> but it's like <VOCNOISE> you don't have realistic expectations <VOCNOISE> of what <VOCNOISE> what children are capable of or what they can do because if they're really verbal <VOCNOISE> and my kids always have been really verbal because i've talked to them from the moment they were born <VOCNOISE> even <CUTOFF-whe=when> yknow when they couldn't talk to me that was irrelevant <VOCNOISE> i was talking to them the whole <CUTOFF-t=time> obviously <VOCNOISE> see i don't shut up <VOCNOISE> so i would talk to them the whole time and <VOCNOISE> so they would always be really verbal and so it seemed like they <CUTOFF-we=were> <CUTOFF-w=were> <VOCNOISE> had a much better understanding and could do things better than <VOCNOISE> they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster <VOCNOISE> and i said well yknow you make sure you give it food and water <VOCNOISE> and when it died it <CUTOFF-n=never?> <VOCNOISE> i was so surprised that she hadn't given him been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you don't <VOCNOISE> yeah they don't get that stuff together <VOCNOISE> or when she was eleven we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could <CUTOFF-t=to?> wait to buy something else well within <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> three or four months it was gone yknow and so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress on the floor in her room because <VOCNOISE> but i mean now that was bizarre <VOCNOISE> now <VOCNOISE> with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things or i <HES-would> <VOCNOISE> i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it <VOCNOISE> and secondly <VOCNOISE> 
<VOCNOISE> if that happened <SIL> i would be ten times more understanding and i would say <VOCNOISE> yknow i would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> i yeah i shouldn't have done that so now let's just go get some more furniture <LAUGH> <IVER>
do you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and and she always says oh mom it was fine she said <VOCNOISE> i got to do <VOCNOISE> a whole lot of things you won't let them do now <LAUGH> <LAUGH-in> <LAUGH-exchange> for that now that i know better <VOCNOISE> so <CUTOFF-ey=it's? she she's always very generous about it and says she had more time alone with me and <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> i got divorced when she was or her <VOCNOISE> i split up with her dad when she was about a year and a half <VOCNOISE> and so for until she was six it was just she and i <IVER>
so we had a lot of time together and she says she thinks that was worth it <IVER>
it was okay to put up with my trying to learn how to be a parent <VOCNOISE> in exchange for having me all to herself <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
in a <EXT-strange> <EXT-city> i <CUTOFF-kno=know> <VOCNOISE> oh my god <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well see <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <CUTOFF-fa=father?> my husband would do that though <VOCNOISE> it's so bizarre because <EXCLUDE-name> is <VOCNOISE> i don't know what's <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-d=don't?> <VOCNOISE> i honestly don't i think that's where his brain is completely lacking <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i make i get to make <SIL> all the decisions at my house about <VOCNOISE> discipline and about what people can do and can't do <VOCNOISE> and we <VOCNOISE> all understand this and it's perfectly fine <VOCNOISE> and he says <VOCNOISE> i'm not a good judge of that <VOCNOISE> you'll have to check <CUTOFF-wi=with> because my son when my son was like eleven <VOCNOISE> he let him come to campus with his skateboarding friends i said where are they <VOCNOISE> oh they said they were going down on <CUTOFF-ca=campus> <VOCNOISE> i said <VOCNOISE> on campus <VOCNOISE> over my dead body <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow> he's not allowed down there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and so <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it's?> it's the thing is though <VOCNOISE> it's almost like <VOCNOISE> i'm really glad that <EXCLUDE-name> willing to say <VOCNOISE> i just can't make those <CUTOFF-de=decisions> uh he'd let <VOCNOISE> he'd let my daughter who's <CUTOFF-thirtee=thirteen> he left <VOCNOISE> left her at the movies one night <VOCNOISE> they went to the movies there was no um <VOCNOISE> the movie they went to see was sold out <VOCNOISE> the next one wasn't gonna start until nine thirty which means this kid's <NOISE-twelve> years old <VOCNOISE> so that would have been eleven thirty twelve <CUTOFF-owk=o'clock?> yknow <VOCNOISE> at the lennox he leaves her there with one of her friends <VOCNOISE> some boy <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> although <EXCLUDE-name> this tom-boy who's just amazing but so anyhow uh he left her there <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> uh <UNKNOWN> they said they called me but i <CUTOFF-diy=didn't?> i was running the sweeper so i didn't hear the phone <VOCNOISE> so <EXCLUDE-name> left her there and he said that she was gonna call back yknow at at a certain time and i was gonna tell her what she could or couldn't do <VOCNOISE> so i said yknow well you're gonna have to come <CUTOFF-he-here> home yknow he's gonna have to come and get you oh come <EXT-on> no <VOCNOISE> we're not gonna do that i you know you can't be this late <VOCNOISE> so he went back down <VOCNOISE> picked them <CUTOFF-u=up> <VOCNOISE> and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven <IVER>
then his parents can pick him up <VOCNOISE> and everybody was annoyed my husband said <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> i would've let her stay i don't understand why you're doing this <SIL> i don't care <VOCNOISE> i want her to come home <VOCNOISE> the other <VOCNOISE> well the bottom line it was hysterical because <VOCNOISE> she and this little boy they're outside and he they're jumping and he's jumping on the trampoline i go out to him and i introduce myself and i say yknow honey i said <VOCNOISE> really sorry about the plans but <VOCNOISE> i just you couldn't <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> i just could not let you <CUTOFF-guy=guys> her stay there that long he goes <VOCNOISE> oh that's okay my mom would never let me do that <VOCNOISE> so and i'm thinking yknow <VOCNOISE> here's <CUTOFF-a=all?> everybody's acting like i'm the bad guy <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i'm i'm the one who's into <VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> there <CUTOFF-w=was?> i just wanna tell you one more thing that was funny because <SIL> um there was something <EXCLUDE-name> she wanted to skip a play rehearsal that i wouldn't let her skip <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> it was for a party that her friends were having <VOCNOISE> and i understood it was important to her but when you have commitments you <CUTOFF-j=just> you keep your commitments <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> was saying he agreed with me and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case <VOCNOISE> she goes <VOCNOISE> so what's with him <VOCNOISE> he never has an opinion <VOCNOISE> how come all of a sudden he's allowed to have an opinion tell me what i can do yknow it was really funny <VOCNOISE> we laughed about it and <VOCNOISE> i let her um <VOCNOISE> i let her skip <LAUGH-it> <LAUGH> because i decided that it was so important to her <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> but it was just so funny yknow <VOCNOISE> i know we talked too long but this is so much fun <IVER>
<LAUGH> do you have a three o'clock <IVER>
we gotta <CUTOFF-g=go?> <IVER>
okay <IVER>

<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
ok <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
great <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
sure <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i grew up in lima ohio <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and which is only about an hour and half from here <SIL> north <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i came here in <SIL> nineteen ninety one i believe <SIL> <VOCNOISE> here being columbus <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i got married about three years ago <SIL> and right now i'm in the process of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> doing a little bit of everything i've worked all my life <VOCNOISE> um until about the <SIL> past <SIL> <VOCNOISE> two years <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i've just been working like part time <SIL> and um doing crafts and things like that <SIL> because i've always been like in the financial <SIL> analytical end and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the other side of my brain wants some work <IVER>
<SIL> so really that's about it i have a dog <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's outside right now and that's it <SIL> for my kids <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<SIL> um really anything <SIL> like right now i'm just painting and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um they laugh at me because i went the other day and found some chairs that were <SIL> that <SIL> badly <VOCNOISE> and asked if i could have them cleaned them up <SIL> and i'm painting those and things like that <SIL> so <IVER>
<SIL> no <IVER>
no <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i gave them to my sister and my mom and stuff like that <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> it's kind of fun <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
yeah no that'd be neat i'd love to do that <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <SIL> yeah <SIL> that would be fun <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm looking for a part time job as we speak i've been like doing temporary on and off <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the thing with that is you could work <SIL> yknow for four five months and then nothing <SIL> and then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just <SIL> like that so right now i'm looking for something permanent <IVER>
uh mostly accounting <SIL> things like that uh such as accounts receivable for nursing homes and <VOCNOISE> things like that pretty in depth <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> some of the day by yknow if i just go for a day it's filing and what not getting phones <VOCNOISE> but most of the jobs actually <SIL> you learn a lot <SIL> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> boy it would have to be <SIL> um something that i actually enjoy <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <CUTOFF-w=what> <CUTOFF-w=what> <SIL> what happened was ever since i came to columbus <VOCNOISE> almost every company i work for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i wasn't interested in that <SIL> uh because my husband works for the state <VOCNOISE> so obviously he's not going anywhere <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so i got tired of that and that's why i kind of went to temping and stuff <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so it'd be one with a variety <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i'm <CUTOFF-unfort=unfortunately> i say unfortunately good at accounting and stuff <VOCNOISE> but that doesn't get to express my creative side as much so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it would be um <SIL> my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people as well <VOCNOISE> and like <SIL> would do presentations at seminars and stuff like that occasionally too <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
just a teeny bit <IVER>
enough to satisfy me <VOCNOISE> so that was good <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i do <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i prefer <SIL> i've done it by myself but i would <ERROR-pf=prefer> prefer to do it with my husband <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and stuff <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> europe <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i was there for almost a month <VOCNOISE> did one of those tours where you get on the bus <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and did the london and the france the and italy and to holland and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> germany and everything <SIL> that was really neat <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> that's very true <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> we haven't done that much yet uh because his family lives in albuquerque new mexico <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> we're <SIL> at <CUTOFF-a=at> at least every other year we're out there <IVER>
which is great <IVER>
but it takes away that big trip <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um we've been and then his brother got married in hawaii <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so we went out there so <SIL> we've just done the honeymoon at disney world <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the albuquerque a couple times and hawaii <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but we have plans to go to europe he he wants to go to england and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> things like that and i wanna we're looking into greece <IVER>
so <IVER>
<SIL> yes <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh actually kawai <SIL> yeah so it was really nice <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i thought it <VOCNOISE> course i didn't go to all of them but <SIL> it was nice <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and it it has the least amount of people <SIL> which is kind of neat <SIL> as far as tourism <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not bothering me but when i talk and move my head <IVER>
it's like hitting me and i just am not sure you can tell me if it's not <SIL> <VOCNOISE> anywhere near my mouth <IVER>
<SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> it's i keep it wasn't <SIL> but then it moved so <SIL> well <SIL> there we go <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> hilliard <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i like it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i've lived <VOCNOISE> i've only lived in the northern end i've lived in dublin <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and old worthington <VOCNOISE> and now hilliard which is kind of around the side <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um but i like it because it has it's own little <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well especially worthington it's own little city within a city <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> i think they have a lot to do <SIL> yknow the parks and things like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> um <SIL> i'll just hold it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but i like it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because it has art <SIL> and culture <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it doesn't feel like a big city <IVER>
unless you get stuck in traffic <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah but i <CUTOFF-bu=but> <SIL> i have <SIL> purposely tried to work close <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or do the back roads it's nice from hilliard you can get almost anywhere <VOCNOISE> <SIL> whether it be here <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or yknow where i've been working <SIL> on back roads so it's not that bad <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yes <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
the snouffer and all that <SIL> yep <IVER>
i used to live up there too <IVER>
so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
very much so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i think this year it's gonna be even worse <SIL> stocking up <SIL> water <SIL> <LAUGH-no> <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yes <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> really <SIL> i haven't noticed that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yet <SIL> huh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think it's probably too though that a lot of people haven't <SIL> aren't used to it <SIL> i mean they're not from ohio <VOCNOISE> i've <CUTOFF-f=found> <SIL> found that in columbus a lot <SIL> so they're kind of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow more tentative or they're from the south or something like that <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but <SIL> i've noticed that a lot of people <SIL> rarely do you meet people born and raised in columbus <SIL> so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
huh <IVER>
that's good <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no not really actually <SIL> <CUTOFF-so=some> some i have and then i've run into the people that <SIL> just like anything they wanna get out of their hometown they don't like it they complain <VOCNOISE> but normally i find that those people <SIL> aren't taking advantage of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the <SIL> yknow free art shows and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i mean the things that are free i'm like oh have you done this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i didn't even know about it and you've lived here all your life and i've only lived here x number of years and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> well just even like the <SIL> parks <IVER>
or um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like the <SIL> art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the the irish festival in dublin <VOCNOISE> which can be free yeah on certain days and things like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> the concerts on the river <SIL> or on the worthington <SIL> green <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> really anything like that <IVER>
and they used to have the laser light show downtown <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-the=they> they don't have it anymore <SIL> um yknow just even if you do one thing free a month <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it <SIL> it doesn't have to cost anything but you <SIL> you can go do it with your family or whatever so <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> 
<LAUGH-I_didn't> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> no my husband yeah he's uh he's from she can wear a bandanna but that's it <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and i yknow i would love to do that with her only on things like that i wouldn't be the type that would put a sweater on her on tuesday and a little skirt on her on wednesday <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i i would get a kick out of that <SIL> um <SIL> she <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yes <SIL> um <NOISE> we're both <SIL> i've gotten kind of bad uh <SIL> but my husband's a marathon trainer <SIL> i try to run with her at least two or three times a week because she's he's too fast for her <VOCNOISE> um but we go to like hoffman farms <VOCNOISE> up in <HES-off off of cosgray in hilliard i'm not sure if it's in hilliard but <VOCNOISE> um we've taken her to the scioto part <IVER>
for the concert on the river <VOCNOISE> we don't tend to take her to things like the art festival or the it's just too crowded <IVER>
and it's not fair to her or the other people <IVER>
uh because she has been known to help herself to bread <SIL> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-when> <VOCNOISE> we were like brain dead after this race and my husband took her and we know better but <SIL> we were like <SIL> yknow after you run you're kind of like uh <VOCNOISE> and she <LAUGH-actually> <NOISE> jumped up on the table and looked around and took a piece of bread and i'm like <SIL> oh my gosh <IVER>
you're so embarrassed <VOCNOISE> i'm so sorry and the guy's like ah nobody else is eating it she <LAUGH-might_as_well> <LAUGH> <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she's a golden retriever <SIL> yeah she's three so she's still puppy but she's getting there <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yep <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah she did that yesterday <IVER>
so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> stomach pump <LAUGH-oh> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> we've kind of broken her of that thank goodness the counter stuff <IVER>
but <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> she's been known to do that too <SIL> yeah <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> sure <IVER>
do they <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
that's nice <IVER>
that's good <IVER>
right <SIL> yeah <SIL> i've run into just a few problems at antrum <VOCNOISE> um since i do like to jog even though i'm very slow <VOCNOISE> most of the people that take their dogs there <SIL> take them off the leash and let them go in the lake and what not <VOCNOISE> which is <VOCNOISE> <EXT-okay> you're not supposed to do that but when i'm jogging with my dog on a leash and all the other dogs come up it <SIL> irritates me <IVER>
because yknow you're trying to run and your dog's trying to greet that dog and the dog's tripping you and you're like <VOCNOISE> i've actually been known to go am i the only one following the rules around here <UNKNOWN> <LAUGH> <SIL> because i'm trying to run <SIL> <LAUGH-and> obviously it's hard for me to run so <VOCNOISE> oh <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
he will be <SIL> yeah it's a week from sunday <SIL> um-hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i would love to do it but <SIL> even when i was <LAUGH-skinny> <VOCNOISE> my knee won't let me <IVER>
i was marathon training and i only got up to about nine miles <VOCNOISE> and um i have <SIL> unfortunately about fifty pounds of extra weight on me but even like i said when i was skinnier <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i have like a bum knee on distance <SIL> i'm okay to run the lower <SIL> but uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> no <SIL> yknow i should <SIL> i really should i do that with the <LAUGH-dog> <VOCNOISE> without even realizing it but i haven't just because i've ran for so many years <SIL> or <SIL> jogged excuse me i don't <SIL> run i'm too slow <LAUGH> <LAUGH-but> <VOCNOISE> get the track terminology there <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah that's a good idea <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i have read that <SIL> i need to try that <SIL> just for winter even <IVER>
you don't slide as much <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that would be good <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<NOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they're pretty good where i live um <VOCNOISE> well last year when we had that really really high snow <SIL> um i shoveled and then like an hour later it blew over <SIL> so was like what's the <LAUGH-point> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <SIL> our neighborhood has a lot of children so most of the people do shovel their sidewalk <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> about <CUTOFF-si=six> yeah <SIL> did we get her <VOCNOISE> we've had her for two years yeah <SIL> we did about six months <VOCNOISE> we went to hawaii and got his brother married <VOCNOISE> and then we came back we knew that <SIL> would be the last long trip <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and we were gonna wait till the spring but we couldn't <SIL> so we went to a rescue service and got her <SIL> <SIL> <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
oh definitely <SIL> definitely <SIL> well i've never had dog and i've always wanted one <IVER>
so this is my first <SIL> i'm like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> want a <EXT-doggy> <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
sure <VOCNOISE> well that and they <SIL> like tuesday <SIL> when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there <VOCNOISE> she came in and i <CUTOFF-di=didn't> i was reading a book <SIL> and i let her out and i let her back in and i started reading again <VOCNOISE> and i'm looking around and here's mud <VOCNOISE> so it's kind of good in a <EXT-way> <SIL> because it kind of well yknow <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> you live here it's not the big of a deal yknow because i know <VOCNOISE> my sister would freak <LAUGH> <SIL> i'm like <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <LAUGH-her_husband_is> believe it or not <SIL> uh they're not really i wouldn't call them neat freaks but <SIL> um <SIL> we tease them because <VOCNOISE> my parents and her <SIL> live within a couple miles of each other in dublin <SIL> <EXT-and> you have to take off your shoes when you go in which is really <SIL> it's amazing how good their carpet looks <IVER>
just from doing that but when you have a dog <SIL> why bother <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and they won't allow dogs <VOCNOISE> so <LAUGH-she's> not allowed to go over there <VOCNOISE> so she's always like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-but> <VOCNOISE> but it does make a big difference so i guess that's what i'm saying for them <IVER>
it'd almost be better if they let the dog go over because yknow she's gonna bring in mud and <EXT-grass> and <VOCNOISE> it's not gonna be perfect maybe knock something over <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> kind of start with her but you have to go home <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean <IVER>
to let her out and that's kind of like i mean of course a kid you can't put in a yard and <IVER>
<LAUGH-leave_them_alone> for hours like i did this morning but <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
<CUTOFF-defi=definitely> <CUTOFF-i=it> <CUTOFF-w=would> it would be nice but no <VOCNOISE> um <LAUGH> <LAUGH-so> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah yeah <SIL> i think so <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah to sit on it <VOCNOISE> she's not allowed on the couch <SIL> but we had caught her last winter <SIL> on the couch <SIL> yknow you come home and it's warm and <VOCNOISE> hey there's a doggy <CUTOFF-b=bone> <SIL> bone up here <EXT-hmmm> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so we've even been known to slightly start pulling out <SIL> yknow let the garage door go down <VOCNOISE> i'd sneak out of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she's on the couch and she's <SIL> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i'm caught <LAUGH> <LAUGH-it's_hilarious> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh we have fun <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
anybody see that 
<LAUGH> <IVER>
ours does that too <VOCNOISE> they're great <IVER>
sounds a lot like our dog <IVER>
yeah my sister <VOCNOISE> and her husband just moved back they went out to nebraska for a year <IVER>
<LAUGH> and then yeah i got the opportunity um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=a> <VOCNOISE> a company that my sister had worked for wanted her to come back <IVER>
and so they offered to move them back <IVER>
and um <SIL> it kind of worked out because her husband was losing his job any how <VOCNOISE> just kind of one of those okay let's do it <IVER>
and so <SIL> um my parents retired here <VOCNOISE> let's see <VOCNOISE> they've been here <VOCNOISE> i don't know four or five years maybe <IVER>
and my sister was here <VOCNOISE> like i said and then moved out just gotten <VOCNOISE> came back a couple months ago <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> my grandfather just passed away but he was here <VOCNOISE> in a nursing home for about a year <IVER>
um <IVER>
indirectly <VOCNOISE> yes <IVER>
um the <CUTOFF-r=reason?> <SIL> my sister was here only <IVER>
when i got here <VOCNOISE> but i was in <CUTOFF-d=?> one of those yknow youth <VOCNOISE> stupid uh psychopathic relationships shall we say <VOCNOISE> and i kind of needed to disappear <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> uh we never told him where <CUTOFF-sh=she> she had just moved <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> so i just came down here then <IVER>
so <SIL> was one of those <IVER>
things <VOCNOISE> get away from it all yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah so um i came down here <VOCNOISE> because he knew where my parents lived and plus columbus was a lot more opportunity <IVER>
so indirectly it was a very bad reason that i came here <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> it worked out <IVER>
yknow so <IVER>
right <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> well i even had that <IVER>
i mean my <CUTOFF-f=family?> <VOCNOISE> oh my sister said if you didn't leave him i was gonna staple your hair to the <LAUGH-wall> <LAUGH-UNKNOWN> but um she was <CUTOFF-jo=joking> she wasn't kidding though <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-becau=because> yknow it's just one of <CUTOFF-tho=those> oh i can help him yknow i've learned i'm the caretaker <VOCNOISE> like i roll my eyes <LAUGH-because_it's_like> <VOCNOISE> you can't change people that much stupid <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-y=yknow?> <VOCNOISE> it's weird because it was terrible <VOCNOISE> but because he was real controlling and yknow you start to doubt yourself like <VOCNOISE> did i say that <VOCNOISE> right and like he wouldn't let me sleep so then you start to lose that <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean <CUTOFF-y=you> <CUTOFF-real-=really> you <CUTOFF-s=start> really do start to lose your mental <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> woo <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yknow at the time i was like i'm not gonna get anything out of this and it was misery and <VOCNOISE-ugh> <VOCNOISE> what not but <VOCNOISE> i've met people that have been in <VOCNOISE> much worse situations <VOCNOISE> and at least i can kind of relate to them <IVER>
so in a <CUTOFF-w=way> in one way it's kind of a blessing <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> it's very <CUTOFF-f=?fortunate?frustrating?> <VOCNOISE> i my sister <VOCNOISE> has an undergrad in psychology <VOCNOISE> and she worked at like um <VOCNOISE> one of those <VOCNOISE> what do you call them those secretive houses like for women and their battered children that <SIL> yknow you're not supposed to <UNKNOWN> location and what not <VOCNOISE> and she used to get so frustrated um <VOCNOISE> because they'd always go back <IVER>
and <SIL> i understand that mentality now because i went back but i'll tell you the reason i left <LAUGH-was> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-st=stupid> <LAUGH-it's_gonna> sound stupid but <VOCNOISE> he took my teddy bear <VOCNOISE> which i loved and <ERROR-I'ved had for <VOCNOISE> not since i was a child but at least five years at that time <VOCNOISE> and he just <VOCNOISE> he knew i loved it <IVER>
and just took it and ripped it <IVER>
and and <SIL> that split second i was like <SIL> okay he's gonna do this to me he's gonna do this to my kids <IVER>
ain't no way <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
wow <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
it is <IVER>
that's important <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> even though it's an inanimate object it all kind of came together <IVER>
right <IVER>
and i was glad i realized that i <VOCNOISE> nobody would ever mess with my children <VOCNOISE> not even <VOCNOISE> their father my husband or whatever <IVER>
and i realized that so it was like ok <VOCNOISE> i'm not gonna do it for me but <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna do it <VOCNOISE> for the future <VOCNOISE> and and that helped <IVER>
because like i said it all came together because i don't understand how people can let their kids be hurt <SIL> but <IVER>
i'm <VOCNOISE> i'm not built that way <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
um <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
sure <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah it's always kind of scary <VOCNOISE> i think you really need to get away from that <VOCNOISE> to get your self back <IVER>
or you're just gonna go back because you don't know any other way at the time <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <SIL> right <VOCNOISE> but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared <VOCNOISE> doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute yknow uh <LAUGH> <LAUGH-it's> so obvious hello <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but <LAUGH> oh yeah <IVER>
but just that freedom <VOCNOISE> yknow to do what you want to get some sleep to <SIL> eat to take care of yourself <VOCNOISE> to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what not <VOCNOISE> and then it's really clear but if you don't get that <VOCNOISE> and you're always thrust back into it <VOCNOISE> i don't think you can break free <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
that's true <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> no <VOCNOISE> which is i'm very grateful <VOCNOISE> he did like go past my <ERROR-haren=parents'> <VOCNOISE> parents' house and things like that <VOCNOISE> but then they moved here <VOCNOISE> and even though it's public records like who owns a house <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> luckily we haven't had that because <VOCNOISE> we purchased the house <VOCNOISE> my husband and i <NOISE> before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the deed has my maiden name on it <VOCNOISE> but uh no luckily <IVER>
and that's been <VOCNOISE> almost ten years <VOCNOISE> so hopefully <IVER>
hopefully <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> i'd just uh basically got out of a <CUTOFF-n=?> <VOCNOISE> a <VOCNOISE> a relationship <SIL> it was like a rebound type thing <VOCNOISE> um i was in a relationship for like three years <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> he was cheating on me <VOCNOISE> and so i felt really bad and why does he pick her and <VOCNOISE> and then i met this guy who seemed <VOCNOISE> wonderful <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> turned out <VOCNOISE> to be not so wonderful <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> i made a <LAUGH-lot_of_stupid> yknow you look back and you see things you were like this is real obvious <VOCNOISE> but at the time i think you <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> i was like <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> a i can either change them <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> if they love me <VOCNOISE> we can communicate <VOCNOISE> and change things and yknow <SIL> that type of thing <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> right <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-um> <LAUGH> first of all they're not really in love with you and <LAUGH-secondly_you're_wrong> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> so when i came here <VOCNOISE> um i didn't date <IVER>
for over five years <SIL> on purpose <VOCNOISE> i don't think it was supposed to be that long on purpose but i wouldn't let myself date for a couple years after just trying to figure out <IVER>
yknow okay <VOCNOISE> this is what i'm doing wrong let's not do it again <VOCNOISE-di_di_di_di_deh> <VOCNOISE> and then <LAUGH-nobody> asked me out for a few more <LAUGH-years_so> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> so that <LAUGH-worked_out> <VOCNOISE> uh so i really hadn't dated for a long time and then i started dating again <VOCNOISE> and what's weird is you almost go right back in <VOCNOISE> to the patterns because you're so scared you're gonna be alone you see yourself going <SIL> oh i can be with this person and you know in your head <LAUGH> this <LAUGH-person's> not for <EXT-you> <VOCNOISE> and then luckily <VOCNOISE> um indirectly i met my husband <IVER>
four <VOCNOISE> four years ago i don't know it's been awhile <VOCNOISE> four and a half years ago something like that <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> yeah it was like oh this makes sense and he might have these other wonderful <VOCNOISE> things that i'm used to but he's got all of <LAUGH-this> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> so i'll get that little slice and take the <LAUGH-rest> <VOCNOISE> so that worked out <IVER>
um <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that 
<VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-n=?> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-I> didn't <SIL> start dating until i was almost seventeen <VOCNOISE> but almost everybody else <CUTOFF-st=started> <VOCNOISE> had <VOCNOISE> even <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna be thirty six here in a week or two <VOCNOISE> so we're <LAUGH-talking> i graduated in eighty <EXT-two> <VOCNOISE> where <EXT-now> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-k=kids> i think kids are <CUTOFF-s=starting> dating at <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> ten <LAUGH-eleven> <LAUGH-twelve> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> heaven forbid <VOCNOISE> but <LAUGH> i'm sitting here going <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> i didn't even know what i was doing <IVER>
when i started dating at <SIL> almost seventeen <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> so no i think <VOCNOISE> i think you learn a lot from your family <VOCNOISE> and the way their relationships are <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i personally don't think a school can do it <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i think they can help <VOCNOISE> but i think it has to be something that <VOCNOISE> society in general or family <IVER>
unit does it <VOCNOISE> um and it wasn't that i had a bad family unit it was just that <VOCNOISE> there wasn't yknow we never talked about it <VOCNOISE> my <LAUGH-sister_and_I were just talking about that because <NOISE-we_were> <VOCNOISE> she goes <VOCNOISE> we were like <CUTOFF-w=?> <VOCNOISE> yknow how did people start talking about <SIL> <EXT-sex> and relationships and what not she goes <VOCNOISE> you don't <CUTOFF-mem=remember> mom and dad handed me a book <VOCNOISE> i'm like they did <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'm like i don't remember that <IVER>
and she goes well after i read the book i asked them a lot of questions so maybe they didn't give it to <LAUGH-you> <LAUGH> yknow like how we don't wanna go through this again <VOCNOISE> because she's a little <LAUGH-older_than_me> <VOCNOISE> i thought that was hilarious <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
like <VOCNOISE> you mean sexual relationships and what <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> probably the <CUTOFF-r=?> <VOCNOISE> the bad things about it <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um but just coming from my christian beliefs and what not <VOCNOISE> the best thing and i know it <SIL> even though i didn't partake in it when i was a teenager and i wasn't promiscuous at all <VOCNOISE> but i still had sex before marriage <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> just to be <VOCNOISE> it'd be nice if they teach you how to be confident in your self <VOCNOISE> and i don't mean like self esteem but <VOCNOISE> yknow like <SIL> we said if if uh <VOCNOISE> yknow you come from a situation like that that doesn't mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> well kind of like <VOCNOISE> just because everybody else is doing it this way doesn't mean it's the right <EXT-way> <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> yeah <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> <VOCNOISE> yknow i really struggle with that <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE=I> <SIL> i come more from i think the family should teach it <VOCNOISE> but let's be realistic how many families are gonna do that <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> have the <VOCNOISE> mentality to do that <SIL> it seems like um <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> sound like my dad <LAUGH-but_it_seems> like these days <VOCNOISE> most of the people a lot of people that are having kids <VOCNOISE> shouldn't be <IVER>
and the people that <VOCNOISE> would be decent parent aren't <VOCNOISE> because of the <VOCNOISE> situations and what not <VOCNOISE> um just my <CUTOFF-fam=family> <SIL> nobody in my <CUTOFF-fam=family> my sister doesn't have kids i don't have kids <VOCNOISE> we're in our mid to late thirties <VOCNOISE> um our friends just had one <VOCNOISE> um i do have some friends that have <VOCNOISE> like more than one <VOCNOISE> which is great <VOCNOISE> because they're just great parents i'll know those kids are gonna be going in <VOCNOISE> but then <SIL> i have uh other people that <VOCNOISE> like my other friends that just had one <VOCNOISE> were trying to help a a child <ERROR-nin=in> children services <VOCNOISE> that came from <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> imagine it and that's basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids <VOCNOISE> by three different dads <VOCNOISE> and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually <VOCNOISE> had her move in with them <VOCNOISE> they were her temporary foster parents <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> she just turned sixteen <VOCNOISE> so she was fifteen when she moved in with them <VOCNOISE> she refused to change <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i don't know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier <VOCNOISE> but basically <VOCNOISE> all three of them <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna say are doomed but <VOCNOISE> they're not <SIL> even though they're out of that environment <VOCNOISE> they're not doing any better <IVER>
so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> yeah so it's kind of like <VOCNOISE> i'm for education in schools but <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> just like the bad things about it yknow <SIL> sex can do <VOCNOISE> you can get pregnant number one <IVER>
which isn't fun <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-and> number two yknow the diseases and things like that <VOCNOISE> i think that's a good idea <VOCNOISE> to teach just <SIL> that it's not all <VOCNOISE> uh fun and peer pressure and stuff i know i kind of got off track there but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hum <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> because they're gonna learn that on their own <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> i personally think that it's a choice <SIL> i don't think you're born that way <VOCNOISE> because <CUTOFF-a=I> i <VOCNOISE> i have friends <VOCNOISE> that are homosexual and <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-wa=?> i don't believe in what they're doing but <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_don't> do everything right everyday <VOCNOISE> so i still love them and they're my friends and blah blah blah because <VOCNOISE> but i've also known people that <VOCNOISE> were that way <VOCNOISE> and now are heterosexual and are much happier <VOCNOISE> and they realize that it was just a choice they made and things like that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so it's <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> in today's day and age they're gonna learn about it <VOCNOISE> quickly <IVER>
and i don't really think it's something that needs to be taught <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the only thing <VOCNOISE> probably <VOCNOISE> is like <VOCNOISE> what do they call that uh <VOCNOISE> cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think <VOCNOISE> that i don't think is such a bad idea <VOCNOISE> uh because just because you grew up in <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> what i grew up in but i'll i'll give an example i didn't grow up in let's say <VOCNOISE> somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to country music <VOCNOISE> doesn't mean if somebody doesn't do that <VOCNOISE> they're not okay <VOCNOISE> i think that would be a good idea or yknow cultures all are different <VOCNOISE> so if you wanted to view that as a culture or <VOCNOISE> do yknow what i mean <VOCNOISE> that that <VOCNOISE> is something different <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> accept the people you don't have to like what they're doing <VOCNOISE> but they're still people <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> it's hard because i i do come <CUTOFF-a=across> <VOCNOISE> i'm a christian <VOCNOISE> so i believe that homosexuality is wrong <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i don't like i said i'm not gonna condemn them <VOCNOISE> um at all <VOCNOISE> like i said i have friends <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> i understand what you're saying <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but i think that's something more for <VOCNOISE> the parents <VOCNOISE> or the teacher to pick out <VOCNOISE> that maybe that child <VOCNOISE> um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort <VOCNOISE> and not actually incorporate it <SIL> in a <VOCNOISE> thirty student <VOCNOISE> ensemble <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> uh it'd be nice if we had more of an open environment in schools and if teachers really had the time <VOCNOISE> to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talk to them about it <VOCNOISE> and then send them on that counseling <VOCNOISE> one on one way <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> just because <VOCNOISE> if you're gonna teach it to um a large amount of <VOCNOISE> students <VOCNOISE> i'm not even sure if that one <CUTOFF-sh=?> student would listen because all the rest of them <ERROR-wund=would> probably be making cracks and just make them feel <EXT-more> <VOCNOISE> do you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> <EXT-so> i don't <CUTOFF-f=feel?> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
<EXT-so> <EXT-I> yknow they probably all hey you resemble that remark or <LAUGH-ynknow> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> so i hesitate to say that it would really help them <SIL> um it would just be better if somebody could <VOCNOISE> yknow keep their eyes open <VOCNOISE> or if we <EXT-had> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> more counselors or things like that to deal with everything <VOCNOISE> including that <IVER>
normally i would say no <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> i do <VOCNOISE> just because <VOCNOISE> let's face it <SIL> <LAUGH-they're_probably_gonna> do it anyhow <VOCNOISE> and i would feel better for them <SIL> and if <CUTOFF-i=if> <SIL> if they used it because <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> it's not good for the children that are born it's not good for them <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i'd prefer abstinence but let's be realistic <VOCNOISE> yknow i think we're past that point now <VOCNOISE> um i know a lot of christians argue oh but you're wrong <VOCNOISE> well yeah i might be wrong but <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-we> <VOCNOISE> we can't go backwards on that i don't think <VOCNOISE> you can only work on your own <IVER>
it's <IVER>
right <IVER>
<CUTOFF-eh=?> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-eh=?> <IVER>
is not gonna work <IVER>
right <IVER>
even though i knew better at the point <SIL> when i <VOCNOISE> was faced with that at seventeen or whatever <VOCNOISE> i wanted to be <ERROR-dloved=loved> so bad that it was something that <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean <VOCNOISE> and i knew better but you just yknow <VOCNOISE> and it's like well <VOCNOISE> i wasn't that strong granted but <VOCNOISE> i was probably <CUTOFF-m=?> <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF=m=most?> normal teen and <VOCNOISE> i think most of the people i knew at that age <VOCNOISE> were <VOCNOISE> lost it much younger than seventeen <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> ok <LAUGH> eleven twelve it's like ew he we even look alike <LAUGH> forget it <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yeah so i think i think birth control would be good <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> 
<VOCNOISE> it's weird i i wish they would make it <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna say <CUTOFF-fr=free> well i think they do make it free <VOCNOISE> um and i hate to say it but a little bit easier access <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> i don't think it'll cause people to have more sex i think they're gonna have it anyhow <VOCNOISE> so it would only be better <VOCNOISE> and safer for them <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
the shot <IVER>
okay <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
okay <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> we <CUTOFF-w=were> my husband and i were just talking about this <VOCNOISE> i was saying i'm not in for the <VOCNOISE> yknow george orwell nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> my ideal situation would be <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> somebody decides who should have kids and who's not but i don't think god's gonna come down and do that <SIL> <LAUGH-so_well_yknow_what_I_mean> <SIL> we can't really decide that <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to be honest <VOCNOISE> i'm for it <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it doesn't have to be well i'm not even sure tubes tied is <VOCNOISE> is pretty <SIL> permanent <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <SIL> even if they could do something like on a yearly basis <VOCNOISE> and give them two hundred dollars a year <VOCNOISE> that's still not still much cheaper than them having kids <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and then if they <CUTOFF-w=would?> <SIL> i'd give more money if they'd clean up their act <VOCNOISE> just for them <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> as far as it being racist i don't think i think they're missing the <CUTOFF-p=point> <SIL> the point <VOCNOISE> because i'm sure there's some runaway white <SIL> teenage girls out there too <VOCNOISE> or mexican or what not <SIL> um <IVER>
think the point is they're on drugs yknow and i don't <SIL> yeah <SIL> i'm not <SIL> i don't consider myself racist at all <SIL> it is <LAUGH-unfortunate> that that's what's happening but <VOCNOISE> it's just one of those things that you hate to say yeah i'm for it because you sound like <VOCNOISE> it's like <SIL> everything is specific <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> permanent <VOCNOISE> yeah i kind of have a problem with that <SIL> um because they might change their mind <VOCNOISE> but then again they can always adopt <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> i kind of look at it that way there's enough kids out there that <SIL> need love and <IVER>
you don't <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> which cracks me up because if you've ever looked at the parents of models they're not necessarily all that <LAUGH-attractive> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <EXT-that's> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i know <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i do too <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> um <SIL> not to sound like a broken record but i really think it's <SIL> our uh <VOCNOISE> backslide on <VOCNOISE> on family units <VOCNOISE> i think it's too easy to stay <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> and i've been married and divorced so i've <VOCNOISE> unfortunately had that experience to me <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> it's too easy to get divorced <VOCNOISE> um people don't really go into marriage with commitment <SIL> and lifetime <VOCNOISE> and have that <SIL> i don't wanna say old fashioned values but just the value of this is very important <VOCNOISE> um because lets face it <VOCNOISE> to <SIL> to me love is a choice <VOCNOISE> because there's times when i don't love my husband i wanna smack him and he's being a little barney <VOCNOISE> but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes <VOCNOISE> and lo and behold an hour later week later what <CUTOFF-ha=happens> <LAUGH-whatever_long_it> takes <VOCNOISE> i'm in love with him again <VOCNOISE> i mean really <VOCNOISE> yknow what i'm saying <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> i think it's just too easy to get divorced <VOCNOISE> i don't believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of a just children <VOCNOISE> but i think if you really make that commitment and <VOCNOISE> actually work on it <VOCNOISE> you can have a great relationship you can <CUTOFF-h=have> have kids <VOCNOISE> and bring them up in <SIL> a more stable environment <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> unfortunately i think that's <VOCNOISE> the problem <VOCNOISE> parents <VOCNOISE> um are <SIL> a either getting divorced <VOCNOISE> and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other <VOCNOISE> yknow using the kid as a medium <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> they're too selfish and don't listen to their kids or they didn't <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna say selfish but lets face it like we said yknow even having a dog takes some time out of your <CUTOFF-s=schedule> <SIL> your <CUTOFF-s=schedule> <VOCNOISE> your schedule <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> not spend enough time with the kids <VOCNOISE> yknow they're working what not <SIL> and it takes a lot of effort <VOCNOISE> to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them <VOCNOISE> and let them grow and things like that <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and i don't think <SIL> enough <SIL> families are doing that <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i think <CUTOFF-ih=?> <SIL> uh some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely <VOCNOISE> um you do go through a period in your life <SIL> where <VOCNOISE> you don't feel like you have any friends or <VOCNOISE> you feel totally different <VOCNOISE> i mean i <LAUGH-still_go> through that i think we all go through that at some point or other <VOCNOISE> even yearly for some of us <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i'm just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody <VOCNOISE> either in his family <VOCNOISE> i say he <CUTOFF-k='cause(because)?> using those for example <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> the parents paid a little bit more attention and didn't have that blind eye <VOCNOISE> i think that's part of your responsibility as a parent that <VOCNOISE> if you see something potentially evil or wrongdoing in your <VOCNOISE> child's eyes <VOCNOISE> you need to really admit it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i mean you don't wanna do that <SIL> but <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
and his mom even signed for stuff i think <IVER>
yeah i mean yknow <LAUGH> signing <VOCNOISE> oh here you go hun <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> the one <VOCNOISE> i think is pretty obvious <SIL> that <SIL> the blind eye was something that shouldn't have happened <VOCNOISE> the other one <VOCNOISE> that yeah <SIL> you just <VOCNOISE> let's face it at that age and at every age we want a leader <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i guess it goes back if we choose <VOCNOISE> to <CUTOFFo-=or> or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we'll make better decisions of who's gonna lead us <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i don't know i <CUTOFF-r=really?> <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-b=??> i think a lot of it's the family unit breaking down <VOCNOISE> in general <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> and secondly i think to be honest i think the media's gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and i do think <CUTOFF-o=?> <VOCNOISE> yknow they know they're gonna get recognized they're gonna have their name go down in history <VOCNOISE> unfortunately <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think that has something to do with it too <VOCNOISE> um it's frustrating to turn on the news they don't really cover <VOCNOISE> my husband comes from a journalistic background and he'll be like <LAUGH> that's not news <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean it's just <SIL> we get so ah <SIL> let's sit here and watch a plane crash for twelve hours <VOCNOISE> instead of watching <VOCNOISE> i don't know what <LAUGH> little house on the prairie <LAUGH-I_don't_know_but> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-I'm_being_facetious_but_yknow_what_I_mean> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <SIL> and just going over it and over it and over it <IVER>
then you get the shooting out in honolulu and the next day there's another one <VOCNOISE> it's just kind of like <VOCNOISE> that syndrome yknow well at least i can be popular for fifteen minutes or whatever <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i mean i'm not saying not to cover it <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> and then course you have the whole gun control stuff that's just <VOCNOISE> ridiculous <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i think they might have tried any how but obviously they wouldn't have been as <SIL> uh <SIL> good at it <SIL> or <SIL> yknow what i'm trying to say it wouldn't have <CUTOFF-b=been> been as much distraction <SIL> because obviously the bombs <SIL> is something but to <SIL> actually have that <SIL> right there <SIL> i mean have the access and what not i mean <SIL> i guess the grandparents had the house <SIL> locked <SIL> and they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew <CUTOFF-th=??> how to use them and <SIL> uh that scares me 
<SIL> because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the problem with guns in my opinion is you don't have to think to use it <VOCNOISE> it takes yknow you don't have to sit there and load it and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> in a split second <SIL> i think we <CUTOFF-w=we?> <SIL> all are capable of shooting somebody <SIL> for whatever reason <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow just stupidity or whatnot <SIL> i don't <VOCNOISE> just in a split second <SIL> yknow <SIL> we we might have that once in a life where we can kill somebody that quickly <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and you can't go <SIL> oh <SIL> yknow <IVER>
i didn't mean to do that yeah <IVER>
<IVER>
<LAUGH> well exactly <VOCNOISE> i mean there are split seconds where you just wanna shoot somebody unfortunately <VOCNOISE> anybody that says that <SIL> i i mean i'm <SIL> i don't even like stepping on ants <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but there's those moments where you're like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> yeah so i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah unfortunately <VOCNOISE> well some people have to <SIL> i mean yknow the police <ERROR-offers=officers> and what not they're required to carry a gun <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> almost every kid i know that <CUTOFF-h=has/had> <SIL> has had a <CUTOFF-gu=gun> even if they keep a gun <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <UNKNOWN-'oh <VOCNOISE> hidden here and the bullets hidden over here <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they find out a way to get to them <SIL> and um <SIL> i dated a guy where <VOCNOISE> we came in on his little brother and he was loading the bullets in the gun <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and he had them <CUTOFF-t=totally> totally separate <SIL> like that <SIL> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-kids> kids know and they're curious <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i i mean i'm not for guns because i've <SIL> i <SIL> they <CUTOFF-s=scare> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the guns don't scare me the people <UNKNOWN> <LAUGH-scare_me> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no <VOCNOISE> unless they have them in a safe or something <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-th=they?> <SIL> and <CUTOFF-m=my?> <VOCNOISE> i just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that protection like they said normally you use it against somebody you didn't mean to use it on <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <ERROR-evf=even/if(conflated)?> somebody else comes into your house with a gun let's face it <SIL> are you gonna have the peace of mind to go get it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'd rather just have a bat by my door or something <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no thank goodness or if i did i <SIL> blanked it out <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=theyORthe?> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> yeah <SIL> but let's face it the people that have the real good guns are the <LAUGH-people_that_shouldn't_have_the_guns> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> meaning crime and whatnot <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> don't have a problem with people having guns <SIL> but <SIL> we don't need <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> sixty guns per person or whatever the ratio is it's something ungodly like that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they keep making them and <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mean yeah there was a time it was a part of our culture we did need to hunt to eat <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i have friends that bow and arrow hunt <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm not real big into hunting but at least <SIL> they're <SIL> they have to do something besides sit there and <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um plus if they shoot somebody accidentally <SIL> number one it's really hard to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and secondly it probably won't kill them like a gun can <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and you have to use your brain <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i didn't come from a hunting <SIL> background <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> but <SIL> my husband does work for the state highway patrol so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but none of them <SIL> hardly any of them <SIL> hunt <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and a lot of them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they respect them <SIL> if yknow what i mean they realize they can kill people <SIL> we do get some of the <SIL> yknow <SIL> machismo people that just wanna go out and shoot <SIL> things and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> yeah i don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not the guns that's the problem it's the people <SIL> that are teaching <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh exactly i'm planning on just staying in the house if i can <SIL> <VOCNOISE> or whatnot <CUTOFF-ye=yeah> oh yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> i know i mean we're gonna get some water and whatnot because you don't know people might turn things off like you said <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> yeah i think um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> as a whole we've all <VOCNOISE> kind of gone our separate ways <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which is scary <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mean we don't have the same belief system in anything anymore so it's kind of like oh geez <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> definitely <VOCNOISE> definitely <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i haven't personally researched it but i have seen <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i would personally research it if i was president <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um documentaries and whatnot <SIL> and things on twenty twenty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which <SIL> i don't <SIL> <CUTOFF-who=whole> whole heartedly believe just because it's on tv and they say it's so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it's on tv <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> that three strikes and you're out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> has really seemed to work in california <SIL> because most of the people <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that are committing the violent crimes with guns or <SIL> rapes or what not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> are doing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> most of the crime <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so once they're locked up <SIL> yeah it costs more money to house them for life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but they're saving so much <SIL> because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets anymore <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so they don't have to catch them <SIL> <SIL> <SIL> they don't have to process them etcetera <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> so i would really like to see that <SIL> and plus i think once that really <SIL> is <SIL> in <SIL> <UNKNOWN-f> <SIL> <UNKNOWN-k> <CUTOFF-wor=works> the works <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and really working and we're really do we're gonna say we're doing instead of like little parents no honey don't do that <VOCNOISE> no honey don't do that <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean because i think that's <SIL> part of our problem too <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
exactly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think that would deter people <SIL> um <UNKNOWN-b> you get one strike and you're like uh <SIL> oh <SIL> um maybe i better clean up my act <LAUGH-my <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> sure <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no <SIL> no <SIL> but <SIL> hopefully <VOCNOISE> when they do get the one strike <SIL> somebody <VOCNOISE> i say somebody because <SIL> i <SIL> right now i don't really think we have that in place <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but we would need more of a um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> one strike <SIL> stepping stone <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow and <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> <CUTOFF-thi=think> <SIL> let's face it counseling's probably not gonna work <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and somebody in that it would almost take um i <SIL> do personally know people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> go into that type of environment here in columbus and actually work <SIL> with the families <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> work with the kids <SIL> and actually are in there <SIL> living there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> showing them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <HES-it's> it's one thing to go help them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then leave that and go home to your nice house <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't <SIL> <CUTOFF-unfor=unfortunately> <VOCNOISE> i admit it i couldn't do it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> um <SIL> <HES-if> if people really <SIL> did things like that i think there'd be help for them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because they're actually <SIL> friends <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or actually people that have <SIL> been in that environment <SIL> and come out <VOCNOISE> <SIL> those type of people i think might be able to reach them <SIL> i won't be able to reach them <SIL> probably <SIL> just because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> what do i know about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE-word_word> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm <VOCNOISE> yeah i agree <SIL> i don't think it'd be a deterrent at all <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> initially <SIL> but <SIL> if we had more things in place and somebody actually <SIL> realized the background <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and tried to get them out of that <SIL> hopefully even if you save half of them it's better than <SIL> than anything <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum 
<IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
yeah i mean you don't want to see the chain gangs or the people whipping them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean let's that's not right either <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> yeah i'm not for the weight rooms because like they said they come out and then they're stronger <LAUGH-and> <LAUGH> <SIL> they can do more damage <LAUGH> yeah and you're like <EXT-great> and we paid for that okay <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> i think just to keep them busy yknow even if they educate them i've heard of people yknow the education <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> strong <CUTOFF-I=I> i don't think it'd really hurt anybody <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> and <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> i'd say incorporate that with some education <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> of some <CUTOFF-so=sort> yknow <VOCNOISE> mean i don't wanna go out in the sun and work <LAUGH-for_five_hours> or what not <VOCNOISE> plus they're doing something <VOCNOISE> in return for <SIL> free housing <SIL> do yknow what i mean <SIL> it's kind of a give and take there <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> right <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well unfortunately i don't think it's fair <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i think in the long run <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> it doesn't have to be a college education because <SIL> most of those people probably wouldn't want <SIL> a college education <SIL> um but like a trade or a skill or something <VOCNOISE> it'll give them a little bit of hope <SIL> if they do wanna choose to get a job instead of <VOCNOISE> robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did <VOCNOISE> they have that choice <SIL> it's it's <SIL> it's up in their head okay i can either go <VOCNOISE> become a welder <VOCNOISE> or i can <CUTOFF-t-??> <CUTOFF-t=??> have a gun <VOCNOISE> um i mean if they want a college education <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> yeah it's <VOCNOISE> it's not fair <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> for <UNKNOWN> for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer <VOCNOISE> having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens <VOCNOISE> than somebody robbing me someday because they didn't get an education <VOCNOISE> i mean now that's a <SIL> broad spectrum and i know it's not all that cut and <EXT-dried> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yeah it would upset me <SIL> but hopefully i'd step back from it a little bit and go <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> maybe it is for the best <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah i think it is <SIL> course we were fiddling with that so much <UNKNOWN> <LAUGH> <IVER>

<EXCLUDE-counting> <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> um i grew up in canton <SIL> which is near cleveland <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i moved here <SIL> in ninety two to go to <SIL> college <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i spent my <SIL> senior year abroad <SIL> in england <VOCNOISE> then i came back i have a double major <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i had a quarter to finish off <SIL> then i came back and did that and then <SIL> went back to england to work <VOCNOISE> then came back and back to england again and came back and i'm freelance right now <SIL> freelance writer and editor <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> all types i <SIL> i used to work in the music industry so i do a lot of <SIL> music related writing <VOCNOISE> in the position i'm in right now i do it <SIL> just a variety of <SIL> travel writing and that kind of thing <HES-I> <SIL> concentrate <SIL> primarily on editing <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <EXT-as> <SIL> <HES-well> <SIL> actually when i was at ohio state i worked for the newspaper <IVER>
and <SIL> i did a lot of music interviewing and <SIL> writing there and then i moved up to editor <SIL> and it was <SIL> sort of through that job that i got my first job with <SIL> sony <SIL> while i was <SIL> as a <CUTOFF-ha=Ohio> <SIL> as a sort of ohio representative <VOCNOISE> so i was concentrated in ohio state <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> basically <SIL> it's just something i'm not doing this <SIL> as a career it's just sort of something i'm doing in the meantime till i <SIL> decide whether i'm going back to school or <IVER>
what i'm doing <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> a lot of online <SIL> magazines <SIL> music magazines <IVER>
that kind of thing <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh i would <SIL> either go back in uh <SIL> languages <VOCNOISE> or <SIL> actually i'm a psychology <LAUGH-undergrad_so> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
i lived i studied in bristol and then when i went back and worked and then lived again i lived in london <IVER>
<HES-it> it was fantastic <IVER>
right <IVER>
absolutely <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i <IVER>
i can't imagine that it <HES-would've> i mean i'm sure brazil would've been <HES-even> <VOCNOISE> more different experience but i think it was <VOCNOISE> more just <SIL> <HES-a> <SIL> a resentment for <SIL> sort of everything about america and what <SIL> what they're fed it was a real love hate relationship <IVER>
yknow it was <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> while they totally embrace the culture and all the stores and everything like that <VOCNOISE> and the food <SIL> it yknow the fast food or whatever <SIL> they hate it at the same time because it's ruining <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-an=and> <SIL> <HES-and> i had a lot of friends from elsewhere in yknow western europe <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> yeah they just were <CUTOFF-kin=kind_of> <SIL> and <HES-I> <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> i was quite surprised actually because when i first went there <VOCNOISE> uh i'd worked on an <HES-island> <SIL> previous <UNKNOWN> <SIL> i mean mackinaw island do you know it <SIL> sort of just <SIL> north of michigan but <VOCNOISE> and i had met some english people there and it was <VOCNOISE> yknow there all the americans were like oh english people your accent is so neat and <VOCNOISE> all that kind of thing and then when i went there <SIL> yknow i <SIL> and this was actually one of my friends but i remember <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then <VOCNOISE> she sort of looked at me and she said like <SIL> oh <SIL> actually i shouldn't be asking you i don't wanna learn the american way to say those like i wanna learn the british way to <SIL> and people would say things all the time and it was <VOCNOISE> yknow they'd ask you what your background was <VOCNOISE> and if you'd say well i'm american they said well yknow like <SIL> where <SIL> your <SIL> ancestors from or whatever <VOCNOISE> and then you would tell them <SIL> and then <SIL> yknow on the same turn they would just sort of like snicker and be like oh you're not <SIL> whatever of this european thing you're <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow sort of <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah yeah like <IVER>
definitely <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and <SIL> and that what they say that we've done to the language and everything else and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> you're not a typical american <LAUGH-but_yknow> and then the next hour and a half they just say how <VOCNOISE> bad americans are and you kind of think like <VOCNOISE> well thanks for the exclusion but <LAUGH-you_still_have_been_insulting_me_for_an_hour_and_a_half> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yes> exactly <IVER>
right <IVER>
or american literature <HES-or> yknow <HES-anything> <VOCNOISE> yknow if <IVER>
yknow a historic building they're like <SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> there's no history in america <LAUGH-yknow> <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
well it <SIL> obviously i sort of surmounted that because i've been <SIL> yknow i spent a lot of time there since then i think had i <SIL> only studied there for a semester <HES-or> a quarter i would've come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then <SIL> yknow after that yknow you just sort of <VOCNOISE> yeah get to the point where you're just kinda <CUTOFF-l=like> <VOCNOISE> yknow laugh it off and just think oh here we go again and then <IVER>
that's it <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
uh <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> the lifestyle was <SIL> yknow very easy to fit into and i've always been <SIL> yknow <SIL> interested it and <SIL> yknow <SIL> sort of like to the whole like <SIL> european culture <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <SIL> before i went there but <SIL> i think <SIL> the most difficult was <SIL> actually because i was studying english when i went there <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> yknow studying <HES-English> here is <SIL> a dime a dozen and <SIL> studying english in <CUTOFF-amer=america> <SIL> or in <SIL> england <HES-is> <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> sort of <SIL> i don't know uh more uh sort of elitist which i didn't realize before i got there <VOCNOISE> so i was in all these courses i was the only american and the classes were really small <VOCNOISE> and it was <SIL> yknow you <SIL> i definitely got a feeling and a <SIL> it <SIL> there were a few classes that really stood out where <CUTOFF-tha=there> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow there was sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow you'd <SIL> i'd hafta say something or i'd hafta give a presentation or something and it was sort of like oh <SIL> yknow what what does this american know and <VOCNOISE> yknow it was that was the hardest thing is <SIL> the way i was treated by some of my um peers in classes <SIL> i mean not directly they'd never say anything <SIL> terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of <SIL> yknow that feeling of <SIL> uh <IVER>
and what they would say about americans and american culture like <SIL> at <SIL> that discussion group yknow in front of you yknow so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i love columbus actually <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> when i left <SIL> i was <SIL> fed up with columbus <SIL> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> like anything yknow after being away for a while and <SIL> not really <VOCNOISE> yknow being i mean i have <SIL> friends there and everything but <SIL> yknow i missed my friends and i missed <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> really sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> knowing everything in the city because london <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is never gonna be like that for me yknow and it's just a totally different experience and <VOCNOISE> yknow i did miss columbus and i'm kinda glad to be back <SIL> although now i miss london <LAUGH-so> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um <SIL> well maybe not columbus in particular <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i was <SIL> i think i was just a little burnt out because i was doing the two majors and i was <SIL> i had a heavy course load <SIL> every quarter and i had gone to summer school here as well just to get more done and so i'd <VOCNOISE> yknow done seven straight quarters and <SIL> i'm sure that added to it i had a lot of hard classes and <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i was just tired of <LAUGH-Ohio_State_and_tired_of_being_here_and_yknow> <SIL> red tape and <IVER>
that whole thing <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> in english <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
uh <SIL> well i think <HES-only> because i went abroad i had <SIL> basically one extra quarter beyond four years <IVER>
but <HES-as> i said i went to summer school too and <IVER>
i was taking like <SIL> yknow <SIL> twenty one <LAUGH-to_twenty_three_hours> a quarter so <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah i do miss that <SIL> but at the same time i've <VOCNOISE> yknow i had a lot of opportunity <SIL> to be there and to do those things so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i mean there <VOCNOISE> there are <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> it's obviously you can't compare it but <SIL> yknow there are cultural things to do in columbus and it does sort of make me mad when <VOCNOISE> yknow people are kinda like oh columbus yknow there's nothing to do there i find myself defending columbus a lot more now than <IVER>
i ever <SIL> would've before <IVER>
<IVER>
uh huh 
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
absolutely <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yes <IVER>
i'd come back and it's <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
the simplest things <IVER>
<NOISE-um> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> actually <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> all over the papers and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i think <SIL> i mean i <EXT-I'd> i don't know what it was like really here i can imagine but <VOCNOISE> i mean there especially they really focused on <SIL> um <SIL> not columbine but <SIL> the one with the <SIL> the younger kids in arkansas <VOCNOISE> was it <SIL> the year before i was there for <SIL> both of those but <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> in the first one yknow they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear <CUTOFF-ho=holding> holding the gun <SIL> everywhere and <VOCNOISE> columbine <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and <VOCNOISE> yknow their facts were all over the place but that's another <VOCNOISE> kind of issue but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> what i think caused it i mean <SIL> i don't know i think that <SIL> like <SIL> more should've been made of the fact of <VOCNOISE> yknow this <SIL> like <SIL> terrible <VOCNOISE> sort of <SIL> resentment for the other students and <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> yknow i'm not in any way defending <SIL> the guys who did it but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> something <SIL> is wrong <SIL> not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> yknow that you would even <SIL> think of doing something like that <SIL> um <SIL> i don't know especially with <VOCNOISE> yknow everything that was said about the families and <SIL> yknow they didn't seem to <VOCNOISE> of course you never really know but they didn't seem to have grown up in this yknow terrible environment and <VOCNOISE> yknow have that sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> preconditioned or anything like that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yeah i think <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> a lot more effort <SIL> needs to be made <VOCNOISE> yknow to sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow placate those sort of situations and <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> who does it is sort of another question because <VOCNOISE> yknow the teachers already <SIL> are over worked and underpaid and <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> all those kind of things but <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
well i do think access is too easy but it's sort of <VOCNOISE> like anything else i think if laws were passed <SIL> the people who were <SIL> against it would be so <SIL> yknow <SIL> just beside themselves that it would <VOCNOISE> i don't know for how long but i think it would make <SIL> the situation <SIL> not with <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> the shootings and things like that but i think it would make <SIL> the <SIL> just the gun situation probably <CUTOFF-m=?> <SIL> much worse for a while because people would be <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> doing <SIL> illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean too many people have guns here <SIL> there's too much of a <VOCNOISE> in my opinion yknow there's too much of a gun culture <VOCNOISE> i mean over there <SIL> they've <SIL> pretty much <SIL> <VOCNOISE> outlawed guns except for hunting and things and the fact that <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> yknow of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that <SIL> obviously england's such a small country in comparison but <VOCNOISE> i mean that's just amazing to me <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> but it's true i mean the fact that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow the access is just <VOCNOISE> there's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> almost nothing barred and i mean <SIL> just the amount of people that i just hear sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow in conversation talking about oh yeah i <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> getting a gun for security and all this stuff it's like <SIL> yknow <SIL> <EXT-what> your chances of <VOCNOISE> number one needing it <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> number two <SIL> if you were in that just minute <VOCNOISE> percentage of <SIL> yknow <SIL> happen chance that you would need it the fact that <VOCNOISE> if you used it to shoot someone who wasn't yknow i <EXT-mean> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> everything is against you <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah exactly and it's just <VOCNOISE> it's just ridiculous but so many people don't seem to think that way and <VOCNOISE> i do think <VOCNOISE> yeah access <SIL> it would help if access <SIL> were restricted <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> at least if they were more <SIL> careful about it i mean it seems like even <VOCNOISE> the laws that there are in place now aren't necessarily followed and <SIL> yknow that kind of thing <IVER>
but the whole <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> especially with the first <VOCNOISE> few shootings yknow with the children's <VOCNOISE> i mean <IVER>
yknow they shouldn't know where the keys are if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that <VOCNOISE> a yknow how do you explain your way out of <SIL> your kids taking guns to school <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh were they were already in the garage did they not buy them themselves <IVER>
oh right <IVER>
oh right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <SIL> well it's sort of a problem as well the <SIL> yknow <SIL> does <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean uh it's seems <VOCNOISE> yknow from what i've read it <SIL> if you wanted to make a bomb it's fairly <CUTOFF-un=uncomplicated> <SIL> uncomplicated <SIL> yknow so <VOCNOISE> that's <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> at the age that they were <IVER>
i don't know <SIL> i <SIL> i wouldn't <SIL> personally like think that the parents should be held responsible <VOCNOISE> i mean they do have <VOCNOISE> yknow a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should've been more aware and <SIL> and especially because <VOCNOISE> i mean i believe that those <VOCNOISE> or at least one of the two had been in <VOCNOISE> counseling and <VOCNOISE> had to <SIL> yknow was doing it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> aggression management or something like that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yknow you would think <SIL> that <SIL> if they were going through something like that <VOCNOISE> you would just sort of <SIL> yknow maybe keep a closer eye on <SIL> what they were doing so i think <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> to that degree <SIL> yknow the parents should've <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> um <SIL> worse <VOCNOISE> sort of responsible <SIL> and also <VOCNOISE> with like their kids disposition i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> would you not notice some difference if something like that was going to happen i mean depending on <SIL> a <SIL> yknow how well they hid it or whatever but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think at that point though you're <SIL> you're so influenced by your peers <IVER>
that like <HES-uh> <SIL> the parental influence isn't as much as <SIL> yknow before then i think by the time that you are past adolescence <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
i know <IVER>
um <SIL> well like i said before i think <SIL> i don't know i think screening would be very difficult <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> especially <SIL> because at that age you're gonna have a lot of people who are <SIL> yknow people say things to say things and to get a reaction and <VOCNOISE> to tell their friends that <SIL> they said i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> they can play off <SIL> whatever and unless they were <VOCNOISE> yknow 
<SIL> highly <SIL> skilled or trained in that area i mean <SIL> you can't really do a simple sort of screening and <SIL> these are good and these are bad uh and <VOCNOISE> again as i mentioned previously <SIL> i think it's more to do with <VOCNOISE> maybe being aware of the interaction <SIL> of <SIL> yknow the different students with each other and <VOCNOISE> i mean if it was as bad as <SIL> they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and <VOCNOISE> i mean you're you're never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and different cliques but <SIL> i can't help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would <SIL> do something like that <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> yknow <SIL> had to have been more than just <SIL> yknow sort of <SIL> normal <SIL> jocks versus <SIL> whatever <SIL> so i think it should be more <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> i mean even <SIL> yknow i went to a <SIL> private <SIL> catholic highschools <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> even there yknow there was <SIL> yknow uh <SIL> a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on <VOCNOISE> should definitely not have been going on and that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> only on a very small level there were eighty six people in my graduating class yknow and i mean <SIL> this is a highschool with like several hundred students that this happened at so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> i think in fifth grade <SIL> was the first <IVER>
um <SIL> i mean at that point <SIL> i uh <SIL> i certainly didn't have <SIL> any uh <SIL> real <VOCNOISE> knowledge <LAUGH-about_any> of that sort of thing <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yknow they covered <VOCNOISE> the basics <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> they did talk about condoms and <VOCNOISE> um contraception <VOCNOISE> i remember we <VOCNOISE> watched a film <SIL> which everyone was very embarrassed by <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i mean i don't really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh they uh they did send home a packet to the parents <VOCNOISE> because i remember being really upset and not wanting my mom <LAUGH-to_talk_with_me_about_it> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> yknow i think what they did was <SIL> fairly good they didn't really <VOCNOISE> as far as i remember at that point at least they didn't <SIL> well they must have done gone into the sort of moral issue <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but it i <SIL> what i remember was more of a scientific approach <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
all i remember is <SIL> them talking about condoms i don't think they talked about <SIL> anything besides that <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> then again <VOCNOISE> i could <LAUGH-be_remembering_wrong> <VOCNOISE> um but yes that <HES-I> mean <VOCNOISE> it is the stance but i think <VOCNOISE> in the schools <SIL> i mean that's sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they're a little bit more realistic <SIL> i mean this wasn't <SIL> i mean it was a catholic school but we didn't have nuns or anything there i mean <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yknow i think <SIL> they were sort of <SIL> more concerned with <SIL> yknow <SIL> it it actually it might have been later than the first <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a <ERROR-coup-ah=couple> <VOCNOISE> like eight grade that they talked about condoms <SIL> i doubt that they would've done that that early now that i think about it <VOCNOISE> but i know that there was at one point <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> some sort of <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because i think <SIL> yknow <SIL> <EXT-if> <SIL> if they're going to <SIL> they're going to and <SIL> i don't think <SIL> a lot of them at <SIL> that stage are gonna go out of their way to go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and buy them so i don't think it's like <SIL> oh i have a condom i'm going to have sex <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean actually it's <SIL> this <VOCNOISE> is is very hot topic in england right now because they they've got <SIL> the highest rate <SIL> of teenage pregnancy in the world <VOCNOISE> and i mean there are stories everywhere about <SIL> yknow twelve year olds having babies and <VOCNOISE> i mean there they've gone to distributing <SIL> condoms on playgrounds which i do think is <SIL> a little bit <VOCNOISE> too much i think maybe having them available in the nurses office is one thing <VOCNOISE> they're there <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> they can go and <SIL> and <SIL> get some or something but i think actually like physically <VOCNOISE> yknow passing them out is a bad idea <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow uh <SIL> because of the simple fact of the statistics that they're they are doing it so <SIL> at least <SIL> at the very least they might as well be <VOCNOISE> yknow safe about it <IVER>
um <SIL> well actually <SIL> it's <SIL> sort of all happening in a certain area <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow with <SIL> yknow very high unemployment like council <VOCNOISE> council states <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yknow <SIL> the sort of stereotype yknow kind of bad family environment <SIL> yknow <SIL> parents have lots of <SIL> boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and <VOCNOISE> yknow a lot of these <VOCNOISE> girls that have been interviewed <SIL> yknow say oh yknow i wanted something to love or <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling <SIL> and <SIL> yknow a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed was saying <VOCNOISE> oh yknow he had <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> slept with like <SIL> ten girls or something and <SIL> i'm thinking <SIL> oh my gosh yknow and he's thirteen and <VOCNOISE> yknow had a few kids and <VOCNOISE> that was it but <VOCNOISE> in my opinion the main problem there is <VOCNOISE> they get more support <SIL> even at that age <SIL> when they have <SIL> they <SIL> yknow they get unemployment because once they've had a kid even if they're not <VOCNOISE> of working age they get like a <SIL> an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think <CUTOFF-f=fifteen> <SIL> um fifteen or sixteen <VOCNOISE> if they have a baby they're provided they're <CUTOFF-li=like?> <SIL> the top of the list for a council house <VOCNOISE> so they get their own there was actually a <SIL> long documentary on before i left <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yknow of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow her parents were at the end of their rope <VOCNOISE> she got pregnant and she was like well <VOCNOISE> yknow hey <SIL> this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets <SIL> money for herself money for the baby she doesn't have to pay any utilities or anything <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> yknow <SIL> what more <VOCNOISE> could she want <SIL> yknow was basically what she was saying <SIL> i've got my own place i can do whatever i want i'm getting money and i don't have to work <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that i think is a very bad situation because they're almost rewarded for <SIL> yknow <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um <SIL> you'll <SIL> i i just got back from <SIL> a year in england so <CUTOFF-y=yeah> i'm not sure about the new <IVER>
right <IVER>
stay on it <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum 
<IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well is there any kind of <VOCNOISE> yknow training i mean do you <SIL> are they doing like the whole <VOCNOISE> job training after the two years or during the two years <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
i think that's great <SIL> yknow i think <SIL> obviously <VOCNOISE> there's always <SIL> a down side and <SIL> but <SIL> i think that <SIL> too many people abuse the system <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> unfortunately <SIL> it's <SIL> very hard when <SIL> yknow <SIL> then it ruins it for the people who really do need it <SIL> and but <VOCNOISE> yknow as long as they have <VOCNOISE> yknow created <SIL> a system <SIL> whereby <SIL> yknow it won't be <VOCNOISE> obviously as good for those people <VOCNOISE> as it has been the ones who are genuinely unemployable but <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i think <SIL> depending on how <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> sort of focused they are on <VOCNOISE> the individuals in their area or whatever however it's divided up <VOCNOISE> i don't know hopefully <SIL> not special treatment but obviously you would try to steer them more in <SIL> whichever direction they're most suited for <VOCNOISE> yknow as <ERROR-fall=far> <VOCNOISE> far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow there is so much volunteering to be done <SIL> everywhere and even if you don't have <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> if you're lacking in <VOCNOISE> whatever way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-you'd> think that you can <SIL> yknow there is something <VOCNOISE> yknow hopefully that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
actually they're they are working on it i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you uh <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> they've <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they've um just instated some bonus schemes where <VOCNOISE> as <SIL> the poverty <CUTOFF-lete=level> <SIL> level i think is considered um <SIL> thirteen <SIL> thousand pounds a year <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and if <VOCNOISE> if you're below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like <SIL> extra <SIL> bonus <VOCNOISE> beyond <VOCNOISE> yeah so there's a bonus for back to work <VOCNOISE> you mentioned earlier about like how this would effect the children with this two year welfare thing <VOCNOISE> i mean at least <VOCNOISE> i know a lot more about <SIL> the system there for <SIL> <LAUGH-for_whatever> reason than i do about the system here which is kind of unfortunate but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> there i mean <SIL> i don't really think <SIL> and a lot of situations <VOCNOISE> of course <SIL> i i'm sure there are people who follow it <VOCNOISE> as it should be and who <SIL> who really need it and who really <VOCNOISE> yknow taking care of their children but unfortunately you don't really see that side very much you see the people who like <VOCNOISE> their kids see none of that money <SIL> yknow they're left at home by themselves <SIL> if <VOCNOISE> if they can even <VOCNOISE> yknow get them to school if they even go to school if they're even bothered yknow <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow those <SIL> yknow a lot of there's there <CUTOFF-doc=documentaries> documentaries on all the time there so you really <SIL> it's sort of <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> it's more in your face than it is here at <SIL> that i ever noticed um <VOCNOISE> but i do think <SIL> and and <SIL> with that they have specific programs for the children and <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that yknow <VOCNOISE> if a <SIL> if a kid has bad behavior or <VOCNOISE> yknow bad attendance that you send them home i mean i think that's the most ridiculous thing like surely that's <SIL> not a punishment for a lot of these kids <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> at least in england <VOCNOISE> on these things i've seen yknow they send them home and these kids are just <SIL> doing whatever <VOCNOISE> going around the neighborhood shoplifting bullying <SIL> yknow hotwiring cars at the age of yknow ten or something and <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think <SIL> i do have <LAUGH-sort_of_very_strong_opinions> about <SIL> people <VOCNOISE> yeah who <VOCNOISE> are having all these kids and don't take care of them <SIL> at all <IVER>
um <SIL> yes i <VOCNOISE> haven't they talked about that here actually <VOCNOISE> have they talked about <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right with the human rights <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> personally i think it's a good idea i mean uh <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> to me <SIL> yknow <SIL> it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support <VOCNOISE> yknow and that <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i come from a completely different yknow background and everything else and <SIL> the education and a lot <CUTOFF-m=? yknow <SIL> then most of <VOCNOISE> probably the people that this would <VOCNOISE> um concern <VOCNOISE> but i do think <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> with uh the <CUTOFF-b=birth> <SIL> birth control that is available <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> all the options that there are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> sometimes <SIL> i find it <SIL> hard to be sympathetic for <VOCNOISE> yknow these people who just have so many children that they can't feed they <CUTOFF-t=take> can't take care of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> it's not like <SIL> it was <SIL> way back when when there was nothing and <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> you were just stuck this way i mean a <NOISE-woman> can <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> protect herself <SIL> if <VOCNOISE> yknow the <CUTOFF-m=man> <SIL> the man isn't willing to do it or whatever <VOCNOISE> so and and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> adoption and all the other things <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i mean i feel <VOCNOISE> i lean toward no <VOCNOISE> i don't have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> crack mothers <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but again like the argument <SIL> there on the human rights side was that if they're <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> on cocaine or whatever they can't <SIL> make <SIL> the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like <VOCNOISE> can they make the sound decision to have children <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> um well <VOCNOISE> as far as the racism issue first <VOCNOISE> uh they showed some figures on the news and actually <VOCNOISE> it was <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> more <VOCNOISE> 
white women <SIL> who had actually <SIL> had it <SIL> done <SIL> than <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> than <VOCNOISE> um hispanic or african american <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i don't know <SIL> at least <VOCNOISE> in that case <SIL> i mean before we were talking about the government <SIL> i mean at least in that case there still is a choice <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> there's money involved but it's <SIL> it's not <SIL> so much money that <SIL> it would <VOCNOISE> radically change your life <SIL> in a sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow it's not thousands of dollars if it was two hundred i believe <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and <SIL> that's <SIL> yknow i mean if <SIL> if that <VOCNOISE> amount of <SIL> money <SIL> is <SIL> going to sway you <VOCNOISE> in that direction <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> yknow there is the debate about ten years down the line but <CUTOFF-wha=what> <SIL> yknow is there going to be something that's going to make them change <VOCNOISE> yknow what is it yknow <VOCNOISE> what is it going to be and like how <VOCNOISE> how realistic <VOCNOISE> is it for yknow what percentage i mean i don't know anything about the sort of statistics of <VOCNOISE> people who do clean up their act or anything like that but <SIL> i mean i do think if there is that element of choice <SIL> it's a lot different than <VOCNOISE> yknow the government <VOCNOISE> saying okay this is your cut off limit but i mean the statistics they were <CUTOFF-gi=giving> giving on <SIL> um the average number of children that these women were having and <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> yknow the <SIL> average <SIL> number of children that were just <VOCNOISE> taken to the hospital and left there or <VOCNOISE> yknow just dropped off wherever and and the state these children were in and <VOCNOISE> their lifespan and everything else i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow there's the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the <VOCNOISE> the child's life yknow i mean i think <VOCNOISE> all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and <VOCNOISE> yknow the same <VOCNOISE> is in england yeah everyone saying <VOCNOISE> oh because they were talking about <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i mean again was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> somehow <VOCNOISE> sort of <NOISE> forcing these young girls to at least be on birth control <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> in whatever way and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> again that <VOCNOISE> everyone was up in arms but it's <VOCNOISE> sort of like <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> what is that child's quality of life gonna be when their mothers <SIL> just <SIL> yknow <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh yes definitely in england too <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
hm <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
um i don't <VOCNOISE> i mean there definitely is that image of <SIL> yknow dallas and dynasty i think it's <VOCNOISE> it's worse <SIL> i think <SIL> for <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> image of the tourist like basically they think <VOCNOISE> anyone who can <VOCNOISE> afford to be over there <SIL> must be absolutely loaded <VOCNOISE> yknow and that was sort of another thing <VOCNOISE> when <VOCNOISE> yknow i went to <VOCNOISE> school there <VOCNOISE> is <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i had a scholarship <VOCNOISE> that's how i went there <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> i worked the whole time i was in highschool in college and all this kind of thing but it was just like <VOCNOISE> yeah people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore <VOCNOISE> you must have lots of extra money to throw around <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow they just <CUTOFF-jh=just> sort of don't grasp the fact that <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> you can have made sacrifices to be there <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i do think <VOCNOISE> also in films yknow i remember actually being in bristol and that film california <VOCNOISE> with brad pitt and juliette lewis and yknow they're in <VOCNOISE> the trailer and everything else and <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> their accent and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i remember <VOCNOISE> a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of lounge room watching this and they said like <VOCNOISE> oh <VOCNOISE> yknow something like is that what they talk like or is that what it's like in the south and i thought <LAUGH-oh_my_gosh> yknow <VOCNOISE> what an image to have of like <VOCNOISE> the south and <VOCNOISE> yknow i was just kind of shocked <VOCNOISE> at this <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i think that there <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> with <VOCNOISE> yknow people who are going to university there and things like that <VOCNOISE> there isn't necessarily that opinion maybe <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> in a certain sector like when all you've heard is <SIL> the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> most people <SIL> like me or whatever <SIL> they <SIL> well <SIL> i shouldn't say like <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> yknow people who have more education sort of <VOCNOISE> not even without having to really think about it but <VOCNOISE> yknow there isn't just that <SIL> blatant view i mean i think that it is <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> the consumption thing <SIL> like <SIL> i think a lot <SIL> more realize now <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> i think americans have this <SIL> just <SIL> reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> like <SIL> obviously when you give that a closer look <SIL> so many people are in debt i mean i think i just saw something else on the news that said <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> across the board <VOCNOISE> we don't even break even we're like <VOCNOISE> negative one or something <IVER>
right right <IVER>
right <IVER>
credit cards <IVER>
right <IVER>
exactly exactly <IVER>
absolutely <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
i know <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and that's actually a really interesting thing too because <VOCNOISE> especially coming back <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> moving all my stuff out of storage <VOCNOISE> i've just been on this yknow i'm getting rid of half of everything i own because over there it's <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so <VOCNOISE> loaded down especially when i've spent so much time just living out of a suitcase yknow i just really realize <VOCNOISE> i have so much stuff that i don't need because there yknow everyone has just sort of like <VOCNOISE> a little closet with clothes yknow there isn't stuff all around everything is more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it's like <VOCNOISE> everything is so <VOCNOISE> relatively inexpensive that it's like <VOCNOISE> yknow picture frames or something there might be yknow twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here <SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> yknow they're five dollars a piece lets buy five yknow <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> exactly <IVER>
um <SIL> well i think <VOCNOISE> the price has a lot to do with it <VOCNOISE> because <SIL> i mean that's what i see <SIL> see over there that prevents it <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> there a sort of middle of the line <VOCNOISE> dress that would be like at the limited here or something is <SIL> yknow <SIL> seventy five pounds <SIL> yknow at <SIL> like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that's a lot <SIL> yknow you see them in the limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> really if you buy that <SIL> you're not really gonna be <VOCNOISE> buying <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow more than one or like anything else for awhile and <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> i mean here there is that sort of like yknow <VOCNOISE> he who has the most wins or whatever that <VOCNOISE> yknow phrase is and <VOCNOISE> yknow there is that with <VOCNOISE> c d's and <VOCNOISE> whatever <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> i mean <SIL> even with the food and everything else <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> it's cheap people buy so much of it like portions <SIL> are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean there <SIL> yknow the portions are a lot smaller it's more expensive you just eat less and i mean <SIL> you just see it contributing to everything i mean <SIL> it the obesity problem here and everything else i mean <SIL> it's getting worse there than it was but i mean it's <SIL> nowhere is it any where near and that is <SIL> a large part of the like <VOCNOISE> problem with that <SIL> people were constantly on me about oh why are americans so fat and like <SIL> all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending 
<IVER>
<LAUGH-oh_my_gosh> <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
that is surprising <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah i mean it's just sort of like the whole reputation of <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-m=america> <VOCNOISE> america just being like the country of excess like excess possessions excess food excess weight excess money <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> everything <SIL> yknow and it's <SIL> <HES-it's> <VOCNOISE> yknow i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for <VOCNOISE> about a year and a half <VOCNOISE> and i <NOISE-came> back <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow this i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of mainland europe and everything and i come back and <VOCNOISE> yknow where my parents live there were all these yknow new strip malls built and stuff <VOCNOISE> and i just felt like i was in <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> this like giant <NOISE-Kmart> <LAUGH-land_you_know_I_mean> it just was so overwhelming <VOCNOISE> even though obviously i'd grown up <SIL> with <VOCNOISE> in america my whole life and <VOCNOISE> yknow not that i sort of <SIL> <VOCNOISE-changed> completely but you do when you've been away from it and to come back and yknow to go into these like <VOCNOISE-cavernous> places and like just the other day my friend took me to <SIL> easton and i mean <VOCNOISE> you walk in there and i don't feel like i'm in columbus yknow i feel like <VOCNOISE> it's got to be california or something just because it's just <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> definitely <IVER>
wow <IVER>
right <IVER>
was she where's she from latin america <IVER>
oh okay <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<EXT-right> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh right <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh i bet <IVER>
right <IVER>
<EXT-right> <IVER>
and just totally bombarded and i mean here it's so force fed as well i mean i <VOCNOISE> i <HES-came> <SIL> home just before halloween <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow i <CUTOFF-w=?> <VOCNOISE> i walked into the grocery store and i mean just like <SIL> right there were just like <NOISE> <VOCNOISE-cakes> <VOCNOISE-cupcakes> cookies like <SIL> everything just right in front of you <VOCNOISE> with like all this halloween stuff on and i mean <VOCNOISE> all the holidays in here are <HES-so> pushed at you and <NOISE-it's> such a money making <SIL> yknow and it's so over the top where there it's sort of like <VOCNOISE> there's a little bit of that and there are decorations and stuff at christmas but it isn't so much <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around i mean there <SIL> there isn't that <VOCNOISE> at all <SIL> i mean at least <EXT-in> <SIL> yknow <SIL> my <NOISE-experience> there and i mean i can't imagine <VOCNOISE> because yknow western europe i think <HES-is> <SIL> sort of as much like <VOCNOISE> america as you can get <VOCNOISE> probably <SIL> yknow <SIL> most <VOCNOISE> places elsewhere in <VOCNOISE> in the world <SIL> and i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that would have been a fantastic experience <IVER>
right <IVER>
right right <IVER>
wow <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
absolutely <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> there's the whole theory that <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it has to drop back at some point <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i don't see it happening <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> any <VOCNOISE> time in the near future <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-ydow=yknow> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> as with a lot of the resentment that's felt <SIL> that i experienced toward americans <VOCNOISE> <SIL> rather saddeningly i think <SIL> our culture is starting <VOCNOISE> to really <VOCNOISE> infuse itself into <SIL> europe at least <VOCNOISE> i mean i see instead of <VOCNOISE> us becoming more like them yknow <NOISE-them> becoming more like us walmart has bought yknow <SIL> a <HES-big> <SIL> uh retailer there so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and and it's just it's moving there the whole <SIL> yknow strip malls and i was in <SIL> i spent my first <NOISE-Christmas> there in belgium with a friend and i mean <VOCNOISE> we would drive by and she'd be like oh <VOCNOISE> this is because of yknow your country these people are moving in and buying <NOISE-whatever> and <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-conversely> i see it moving in the other direction unfortunately rather than <IVER>
really <IVER>
wow <IVER>
<LAUGH-oh_really> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
is there <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> the resentment to things like mcdonalds there <EXT-too> <HES-or> is it <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right right <IVER>
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there were a lot of jibes <SIL> about that i remember <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> driving <VOCNOISE> to germany <VOCNOISE> with a couple a english friends and <SIL> to visit some german friends of theirs and <SIL> we got there and it <SIL> we <CUTOFF-we=were> got lost and all these things that took us way longer than it should've and <VOCNOISE> a friend of the person we were visiting said like <VOCNOISE> oh what did you have to stop at every mcdonalds along the way and i was like <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i'm a <LAUGH-vegetarian> i don't even eat at mcdonalds yknow and <VOCNOISE> i was <HES-just> <SIL> yknow and it was really mean it's like <NOISE-that> isn't really a very good joke <VOCNOISE> and that kind of thing came up <VOCNOISE> quite frequently but <VOCNOISE> yknow i always said <SIL> mcdonalds wouldn't survive here if no one ate there and you can't tell me that everyone in there <VOCNOISE> is american <IVER>
and they never were i mean the same with <VOCNOISE> like in france especially oh mcdonalds <VOCNOISE> well mcdonalds was full of all the french people yknow i mean <IVER>
right <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>

<IVER>
<EXCLUDE-okay_test_one_two_three_four_five_five_four_three_two_one> <IVER>
test one two three four five five four three two one <IVER>
okay <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
okay <IVER>
okay uh i've been in columbus since nineteen seventy seven <SIL> and uh i'm an air traffic controller <SIL> and i have three more days to work before i retire i'm <CUTOFF-reti=retiring> i i <CUTOFF-ha=have> i'm retiring sunday <SIL> so and tomorrow's my <VOCNOISE-retirement> dinner <SIL> so uh <SIL> a little nervous about what i have to do there yknow <NOISE> they've told me nothing except show up <IVER>
<SIL> uh i have a daughter at <SIL> o u i know that's <SIL> a bad word for you guys <IVER>
and i have one at northland highschool she's a sophomore there and the one at o u's a freshman <SIL> and uh i'm married <SIL> and uh what else i live in uh northeast columbus <SIL> by seventy one and one sixty one <SIL> and <SIL> that's about it <IVER>
<SIL> uh i'm originally from <SIL> indiana <SIL> but i lived up in uh amherst ohio i lived there for about four years and then i because i worked at a place called cleveland center <SIL> which is an air route traffic control center and i moved from there to <SIL> ohio state <SIL> airport <SIL> and i worked there for nineteen years <SIL> and uh then i transferred to <SIL> port columbus <SIL> <IVER>
about two <CUTOFF-ye=years> <VOCNOISE> two and a half years ago <IVER>
right um-hum <EXCLUDE-name> um-hum <IVER>
oh okay <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh wow oh <VOCNOISE> so you have it on the speed dial <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i don't know what kind that is because i know they <CUTOFF-g=got> they <VOCNOISE> traded airplanes since i've been gone <IVER>
<IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh because uh <CUTOFF-s=some> some of the newer <CUTOFF-w=ones?> jets there's like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner i mean it's <SIL> there are prop planes that are like five times as noisy <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> so <IVER>
oh <IVER>
um <IVER>
oh they do now <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
because they wouldn't let them when <CUTOFF-w=we?> i was there <IVER>
oh okay <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh they uh <VOCNOISE> stopped <VOCNOISE> <SIL> federally funding uh o s u that was a federal control tower <SIL> and they contracted it out so you either <SIL> lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and yknow some people moved like to arizona and california and <SIL> and i thought well since i only have like two and a half years <SIL> til i retire <SIL> and i really like columbus <VOCNOISE> and i thought i don't want to <CUTOFF-roo=root> <SIL> uproot my daughters out of school and <CUTOFF-l=leave> <SIL> and leave and start over so i thought well i'll just go to port columbus and <SIL> suffer it out until i can <IVER>
retire yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well i don't really like the uh i don't <CUTOFF-li=like> <CUTOFF-li=like> <CUTOFF-l=like> i really don't like that job <VOCNOISE> but uh yknow i like the people there but it's like uh way too busy i think <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
oh it can be yeah <IVER>
yeah there are there are times when it all just <SIL> there's a uh group over there called star check <IVER>
and they fly checks <SIL> like <SIL> if you write a check today and you deposit at the bank <SIL> well that check has to go from your bank <SIL> to clearinghouse <SIL> and that's all they do all night long <IVER>
right tuesday wednesday and thursday <SIL> every night <IVER>
so like thirty of them will <SIL> go out at one time and thirty will come back well that isn't too bad <SIL> but they're mixed in with <SIL> everybody else that's normally flying like all the airliners and stuff so and they want to get there a s a p so <SIL> yknow <SIL> i <SIL> i just don't <SIL> feel comfortable doing <SIL> that much at one time i mean not that <SIL> o s u is not a was not a a dead place yknow it was very busy it's like the third busiest in ohio <SIL> but uh yeah it's amazing and they're only open sixteen hours a day <IVER>
so yknow <SIL> um <SIL> it it's pretty <SIL> pretty busy there but <SIL> it <SIL> it's <CUTOFF-sp=spread> spread out over the sixteen hours is where as port columbus sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eighty airplanes <SIL> in an hours time <SIL> so <IVER>
uh well we have an <SIL> upstairs and downstairs upstairs is the tower and there's like a uh ground control <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a clearance <ERROR-levry=level_reads> which reads all the clearances all the airplanes and the ground control taxis them to and from the runway and the tower works <SIL> everybody <SIL> landing and departing <SIL> or any airplane within five mile radius <SIL> then once they get out of that <SIL> radius downstairs which is called the approach control they work <SIL> everything from there <SIL> to ten thousand feet <SIL> and out to about sixty miles <SIL> and when they get to that point then they go to the en route centers <IVER>
so <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> downstairs there's five different sectors so they split the uh <SIL> area up into five different areas <SIL> and uh yknow there are some <SIL> sectors down there that get <SIL> extremely busy and then sometimes it's just like yknow you're just twiddling your thumbs it's <SIL> uh it's like feast or famine <SIL> yknow it's not like steady like if you're <SIL> working at meijer running the cash register it's just kind of like steady it's like you look at <SIL> yknow you <CUTOFF-s=sitting> <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-s=so?> you'd be like sitting at meijer and there's <VOCNOISE> no one in your line <SIL> and then you turn your back and turn back around and there's like seventy five <IVER>
waiting <SIL> and they all want to go right now <SIL> yknow and that's how most airplanes are yknow they all they don't think about anybody else they think <SIL> i'm here why um <SIL> why aren't i first <SIL> yknow so <SIL> <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
right <IVER>
uh well the problem is is um <SIL> like say <SIL> every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their business men there at eight a m <SIL> well <SIL> an airport has <SIL> so many runways <SIL> and so many taxi ways <SIL> and yknow like say <SIL> ten airplanes <SIL> every ten minutes can come in and out <SIL> of those airports <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> they <SIL> end up shooting like thirty there <SIL> so <SIL> instead of letting them all get in the air <SIL> and staying up there and hold while they're <ERROR-foo_uh_fi=firing_shooting> uh yknow shooting them in what they do is they uh <SIL> like uh say going to o'hare they'll <SIL> you hafta call for release times at these different airports <SIL> and they will say well uh <SIL> he can't go right now but he can go like at <SIL> twenty seven past the hour <SIL> so he they know by looking at the entire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport <SIL> when he will fit in <SIL> so it's not so much <SIL> air traffic delays it's <SIL> airlines that cause it themself it's like uh yknow like <SIL> you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room <SIL> at ten o'clock today <SIL> well rather than say <SIL> why don't some of you come at ten <SIL> and another group come at ten fifteen another group <SIL> <UNKNOWN> and we're <SIL> all trying to do the same thing at once and it doesn't work yknow you <SIL> you can't get <UNKNOWN> you can only get so many people through that door <SIL> and if you say well i'm gonna take five at a time <SIL> well they can get in but if you say i'm taking five hundred at time <SIL> it doesn't work and <SIL> so the <CUTOFF-airpla=airplane> <SIL> airlines always go well it's the government <SIL> and regulations and blah blah blah that's <SIL> why we're delayed and it's really them themselves <VOCNOISE> because they're <IVER>
<IVER>
right <SIL> yknow because every businessman goes i want to be there at yknow <SIL> and it doesn't work that way yknow you can't <SIL> you just can't physically do it <IVER>
i <SIL> that i don't know <SIL> but uh yknow it's like if <SIL> if you and i are running an airline <SIL> and everybody wants to get new york at eight a m and you go at eight <SIL> and i go at eight thirty <SIL> who are they gonna fly <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> so that i think that's a problem too yknow everybody says well i don't want to get there at eight thirty <SIL> yknow so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> the one thing they've done is they've <SIL> put on bigger airplanes <SIL> because it used to be yknow you <SIL> like a uh <SIL> say uh <SIL> seven thirty seven would go from here to new york city and now it's a seven fifty seven so that adds more seats <SIL> so instead of <SIL> because i <CUTOFF-wo=would> when i first got there i couldn't understand <SIL> at o s u <SIL> when it was like <SIL> christmas time or something it was just <SIL> you'd drive up and the parking lot was just full of cars and you're like oh boy <LAUGH> <IVER>
gonna be a really busy day <SIL> and i would <SIL> the same thing at port columbus yknow i <SIL> i'd see <SIL> all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i'm like <SIL> and i mentioned somebody i go <SIL> where are the extra airplanes and they go they can't add extra airplanes <SIL> it's <SIL> they have certain routes they can do they just hafta <CUTOFF-b=be> <SIL> put <SIL> bigger airplanes on <SIL> so he said <SIL> yknow you'll see larger airplanes when it's <SIL> holiday time so they can <SIL> put more people on <SIL> so <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>

<IVER>
i know i don't <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> i <SIL> i guess it's just <SIL> over the course of the year everything balances out <VOCNOISE-yknow> <SIL> so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
until they start <SIL> getting <SIL> a little bit better equipment because the equipment is really ancient i mean there's stuff there that's older than i am <LAUGH-yknow> <LAUGH> <SIL> so but they like uh port columbus is getting a new tower <SIL> and they're it's supposed be done in about three and a half years and the equipment they're getting is <SIL> all brand new stuff it's not like they're taking all the old junk we've got <SIL> and moving it over there so <SIL> yknow that will help and <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> nationwide they're also putting new stuff in but the bad part is is <SIL> um <SIL> picture your father <SIL> is your father computer literate <SIL> okay <SIL> he's <SIL> he's at his job and tomorrow morning they come in and they go <SIL> everybody's gonna put <SIL> all their work <SIL> on computer <SIL> well <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> his speed was like say <SIL> seventy mile an hour before and now it's gonna be <SIL> twenty <SIL> because he doesn't know how to do it and that's the problem they're running into they have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes and how to get them in <SIL> trail and <SIL> yknow everything <SIL> but now they've gotta do this <SIL> extra part <SIL> which is going to make their job easier <SIL> down the road <SIL> but everybody hates change <SIL> so what they're doing now is <SIL> it <SIL> they're having problems because <SIL> people can't take the volume of airplanes because they're trying to keep up with the computer so it's making it even slower yet but once they get in <SIL> yknow in the swing of things it'll be okay but <SIL> yknow you're <SIL> you're talking a while yknow because it's not something that you can do overnight but it'd be like your dad learning the computer he's not going to do it overnight <IVER>
and <IVER>
right and if he <UNKNOWN> <SIL> if he's open minded enough to do it <SIL> eventually he'll see the light and say <SIL> boy this would make it a lot easier but <SIL> there are people who are like <SIL> i will not <SIL> do this <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> those the ones that <SIL> hafta be drug screaming and kicking <IVER>
<IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
right <SIL> um-hum there's a lot of uh <SIL> money <VOCNOISE> <SIL> money in town here and there's sometimes like you'll see <SIL> a uh <UNKNOWN> <SIL> one <SIL> entire <SIL> airplane that goes to cancun <SIL> and it's like people are going on vacation or people who are gonna go gambling in jamaica <SIL> that's all it is <SIL> so then when that comes in we have these really weird painted airplanes and we're like <SIL> who <SIL> is that <IVER>
<SIL> and they'll go that's transmeridian and we go <VOCNOISE> write that down because i don't know that name yknow so <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> right <IVER>
i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> accents sometimes but uh <SIL> they they uh they're okay i mean no <CUTOFF-bi=big> <SIL> no big problem but uh the the accent sometime it's like <SIL> um <SIL> there's sort of a uh <SIL> running <SIL> joke i don't know if i should say this but it's like <SIL> if i can talk like <EXCLUDE-this> <SIL> and uh talk <SIL> all the time like this <VOCNOISE> why is it that they can't talk like <SIL> we do <SIL> yknow it's like yknow if i could if i could talk that way <NOISE-because> we <CUTOFF-ha=have> do have pilots that do talk like <IVER>
and <IVER>
<SIL> sometimes <SIL> it's even easier to understand them because their they enunciate so well <SIL> but uh yknow <SIL> it that's something we've never understood yknow if we can <SIL> fake that accent <IVER>
why can't they fake ours to make it easier for <SIL> us to understand but <SIL> yknow <SIL> but no usually there's no problem <SIL> the only problem you usually have is like somebody like yourself <SIL> who has never flown <SIL> and is taking lessons <SIL> and you <SIL> you have about ten or fifteen hours <SIL> and we tell you to do something and you like <SIL> um <SIL> well <SIL> i think i know what they mean so i'll just keep flying and it that's the worst thing you can do the best thing to do is say <SIL> okay <SIL> i heard what you said <SIL> but i'm brand new at this and i've got no idea what you mean can you try it again and they'll go okay now we know where you're coming from <SIL> and they'll make it really easy for you because if they just yknow <UNKNOWN> <SIL> yknow zoom out some phraseology and you go <SIL> nine eight juliet which is <SIL> the <SIL> <CUTOFF-wh=what> how you respond with a call signing the airplane <IVER>
they go she's got it and they go on to the next guy and then all a sudden you're going off this way and they go uh six nine juliet uh <CUTOFF-w=where> <SIL> where are you going and you're like uh <SIL> i uh told me to and then they go oh brother yknow so now <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> the attention is diverted to you so <SIL> that's usually what the problem is because <SIL> most pilots are there are really professional yeah <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
oh understanding <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> we don't really have that much yknow the foreign ones <SIL> um <SIL> it <SIL> it'd probably be like maybe <SIL> two or three percent of our total <SIL> pilot <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um-hum right <IVER>
no <IVER>
um i used to be a charter pilot and a flight instructor <SIL> and i used to go to work at like eight o'clock in the morning and get home for my first meal with johnny carson <SIL> and i did this six days a week <SIL> and to get my <UNKNOWN> <SIL> my one day off i would get up at like at seven o'clock get in my car and drive to the mall and park and sleep in my car <IVER>
because i i didn't own a telephone <SIL> because i couldn't afford one and <SIL> and also i thought if i had one they'll call me <SIL> well they would come yknow if i didn't get up that time on my day off they'd come knocking at the door and say we need you to come for a trip <IVER>
so yknow one day um <SIL> it was a really bad day i'd gone <SIL> to like tulsa oklahoma with somebody and came back and yknow i <SIL> like i said i hadn't had <SIL> anything to eat the entire day <SIL> and uh it was like <SIL> it was like midnight and i got home and i thought oh i'm too hungry <SIL> yknow to <SIL> i'm too tired and hungry and i just thought uh i'm not making anything so i just went to bed <SIL> and uh <SIL> a guy knocked on my door <SIL> which he lived upstairs in the apartment above me and he tell me <EXCLUDE-name> are you in there <SIL> and i wouldn't answer <SIL> well it was a real cheap apartment he took a credit card and punched the uh <SIL> the <SIL> door knob and <IVER>
opened it up and it <SIL> grabbed on the chain and he reached in and flipped the lights on <IVER>
and he goes <EXCLUDE-name> do you hear me <SIL> and i go yeah and he goes you got a trip be out the airport at four thirty <SIL> and i go <VOCNOISE-ah=GROAN> he says you hear me and i go <SIL> yeah uh yeah <SIL> he goes <SIL> well get some sleep and he turns the lights off pulls the door shut <SIL> and uh <SIL> i'm laying there and i'm like <SIL> i've been home like three hours and now i'm just fuming <SIL> and i thought <SIL> i know <SIL> a college education doesn't guarantee you <SIL> financial security <SIL> but i thought <SIL> what am i doing <SIL> working <SIL> yknow from dust <SIL> i mean dawn to <SIL> way past dusk six days a week and making nothing and having people like this come tell me <SIL> you gotta go to work tomorrow <SIL> so i <SIL> went upstairs and knocked on his door and <SIL> told him i quit <LAUGH> and uh he wasn't very thrilled about that but one of my students was a uh <SIL> controller <SIL> and uh <SIL> he came and talked to me and he says uh <SIL> he says i know <SIL> i heard you quit he says i want to <SIL> tell you about <SIL> my job and he was a controller at <SIL> owensboro kentucky <SIL> and uh he said he worked forty hours a week and i go <SIL> well <SIL> i usually do that by wednesday <SIL> and he said that he had uh <SIL> annual leave <SIL> and sick leave and i <SIL> said what are <IVER>
<SIL> and he said that he had a health plan and i said what is that <SIL> and i <SIL> he said he had insurance <SIL> life insurance and i go <SIL> what is that <SIL> so he goes <SIL> yknow we really need to get you over here so that's how i <SIL> i went and took the test and <SIL> started that way <SIL> <IVER>
well <SIL> actually <SIL> anybody can try <SIL> yknow there is a civil service exam you hafta take <SIL> and they place you on a list from that <SIL> and like say if you have an <SIL> eighty <SIL> well everybody that takes it after you that gets an eighty one <SIL> is gonna get hired before you do <SIL> uh so you can take it again but if you score lower you gotta keep that lower score so and that sometimes people are <SIL> yknow kind of <SIL> apprehensive about doing that but <SIL> uh once you pass that and then they say <SIL> yknow the government goes okay we're ready to hire <SIL> a thousand people <SIL> throughout the united states well each <SIL> region there's regions in the united states they may get like thirty for the great lakes region <SIL> so they go down the list the first thirty and they call <SIL> yknow they write each one of them and say <SIL> we're offering you a position <SIL> yknow do you want it or not and yknow some the people have said well <VOCNOISE> i've been on the list for two years and i have a <CUTOFF-j=job> <SIL> yknow like you i have a job and i <SIL> don't want it now yknow so <SIL> and then those people hafta go to oklahoma city to the academy and go through a screening program <SIL> which is really hard <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> at one time only forty percent of the people were making it through that <IVER>
yeah <SIL> so <SIL> it's <SIL> it's a really tough thing to do <SIL> i mean you hafta be <SIL> sort of organized <SIL> and <SIL> i don't know sort of a maverick i guess because <SIL> if <SIL> if you could <SIL> give a test that would tell who could be an air <VOCNOISE> traffic controller who couldn't you'd be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you <SIL> because <SIL> intelligence <SIL> is not a factor <CUTOFF-th=there> i mean there are people who do this job <SIL> who <SIL> i mean are not stupid <SIL> but they're not <SIL> college educated and really intelligent but they're extreme good at it <SIL> and then the other people uh that <SIL> i know of one <SIL> that i work with <CUTOFF-e=every on a regular basis he is <SIL> got a masters degree and he's <SIL> yknow <SIL> he <CUTOFF-b=?> reads continuously he's <SIL> always up i mean if you ask him anything about like <SIL> what's going on on <SIL> overseas or anywhere <SIL> he knows that like the back of his hand <SIL> but he's one of our weakest ones <SIL> yknow and it's um <IVER>
right <SIL> and <SIL> and also the other thing is you <CUTOFF-ha=have> <SIL> you hafta be sort of compassionate because like <SIL> yknow you're <SIL> you're working a lot of airplanes and you're wanting answers like this when you <ERROR-spiut=spit> something out you want an answer <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-th=the> each airplane is supposed to respond with their call sign like if i tell somebody yknow turn left heading three six zero and he's supposed to respond t w a three ninety six roger <SIL> well if he doesn't <SIL> respond <SIL> then i've got to say it again which means instead of <SIL> ten airplanes i now have eleven i'm talking to because <SIL> i hafta tell them <SIL> talk to them two times each <SIL> so yknow there are some people that get <SIL> really mad <LAUGH> <SIL> quick because they want <NOISE> that answer like that <SIL> where <SIL> yknow <SIL> i was a pilot so sometimes i'm thinking yknow <VOCNOISE> 
<VOCNOISE> you're in there flying and you're <UNKNOWN-pilots> turning and you're putting your flaps down and i go six nine eight juliet uh say your altitude and you're like um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-di=did> <SIL> did they call me <SIL> yknow because you have a lot of things going on <SIL> and i'm not i'd i'm i'm mister laid back in that area had a lot of people go i don't see how you can be so calm <SIL> but <SIL> yknow i always look at it though as yknow <SIL> i can scare you to death and you'll never come back to columbus <SIL> or any <SIL> airport that has a tower <SIL> or i can be nice to you and you can go out and spread the word that <SIL> yknow <SIL> there <UNKNOWN> <SIL> there's some people there that are pretty <IVER>
yknow so i figure <SIL> it's <SIL> it's much better to be nice to them because <SIL> there's also times when yknow everybody makes <SIL> errors <SIL> and yknow <SIL> maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh <SIL> yknow like there's an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way <SIL> and <SIL> i really meant for you turn left instead of right and <SIL> you may come back and go uh <CUTOFF-d=do> <SIL> do you do you mean left or right there and <SIL> i go <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yes that is <CUTOFF-r=right> <SIL> correct turn left yknow <UNKNOWN-he_uh> so yknow <SIL> everybody helps everybody out yknow i i feel kindness goes a long way <SIL> and the pilots the same way <CUTOFF-the=they're> <CUTOFF-mo=most?> <SIL> most often they're <SIL> yknow pretty decent <IVER>
no <SIL> i don't i just got too expensive <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
i've never <UNKNOWN-i> <SIL> i've never known of him <IVER>
<IVER>
we don't know who's in the airplane and there but there are c planes that do come in and out of there <IVER>
very often i mean maybe like there's like one or two that come <SIL> during the year <IVER>
but <IVER>
yeah i don't <IVER>
<IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> now if you <SIL> the the the thing you do is if you know the call sign <IVER>
and you know <SIL> about what time <SIL> of the year he's coming in <IVER>
you could call the operations over there and say <SIL> yknow <SIL> is this airplane on the ground <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and you <SIL> you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there now at port columbus you couldn't do that <SIL> but you could over there <SIL> because you can walk around on the ramp over there <SIL> at o s u <IVER>
<SIL> sunday <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh nothing for a <CUTOFF-whi=while> i don't want to do anything until past january <SIL> yknow because i've <SIL> i <SIL> like <SIL> said it since nineteen seventy four i've never had thanksgiving <SIL> christmas <SIL> or new years off without having to work either <SIL> a seven to three <SIL> or a three to eleven <SIL> yknow and it's like i <SIL> i figure i deserve this <SIL> yknow it's about time i get to <SIL> not eat uh thanksgiving dinner at <SIL> ten thirty in the morning so i can go to <CUTOFF-noo=noon> <SIL> uh go to work at noon or something yknow or <SIL> or open the christmas presents uh <SIL> yknow at five o'clock in the afternoon because i work christmas day so yknow <SIL> i think it's <SIL> my time <IVER>
yeah and <SIL> yknow i'd <SIL> i would like to have another job but i would <SIL> i would love <SIL> i know you'll say this is really stupid <SIL> but i would love to have a monday through friday <SIL> eight to five job never work another evening <SIL> a saturday or a sunday <SIL> if <SIL> if it can be now i know i'll probably not be able to do that because <SIL> o s u wants me to come back there so <SIL> as a contractor so <SIL> i don't know <SIL> yknow <IVER>
you mean at o s u <IVER>
oh yeah i would have to work shift work <SIL> yeah <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> yeah <IVER>
media hype <IVER>
yeah <SIL> there is there's like two people who are like <SIL> from the uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=they> i mean they're not <SIL> old but they're like from the forties and they have bought generators they've bought water they've got extra food they've got a <CUTOFF-freeze=freezer> <SIL> extra freezers they bought ammunition it's like <SIL> hello <VOCNOISE> yknow i just think it's <IVER>
<SIL> yknow the only thing i'm going to do <SIL> is maybe two weeks before i might get a hundred dollars from the bank machine <SIL> and uh <SIL> i have three cars so i'll probably have one of them full of gas <SIL> and other than that it's like <SIL> yknow to me <SIL> if you are say bank one <SIL> and i'm huntington <SIL> and january the <CUTOFF-s=second> <SIL> second <SIL> people have all kinds of problems <SIL> you and i are going to be the laughing stock of the corporate america <SIL> and do you really think you and i want to do that <SIL> so to me <SIL> nobody's gonna have a problem because <SIL> <EXCLUDE-years> they're gonna go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> remember bank one <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow you go get ten bucks and you get five hundred out the machine <SIL> uh yknow it's like who wants to do business with them nobody's gonna do that <SIL> yeah yknow maybe some little company <SIL> um that <SIL> really doesn't <SIL> yknow have a big impact but <SIL> i don't see where anything's gonna happen at all yknow <IVER>
<IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
i mean there are people who think cars won't run <IVER>
and it's like <SIL> a car has a computer <SIL> but it does not know <SIL> if it is <SIL> uh monday <SIL> or <SIL> two thousand and fifty it has no idea it <SIL> it means nothing it's not date sensitive yknow <SIL> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> she's a librarian at <SIL> an elementary school <SIL> one block from our house <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> it <CUTOFF-w=was> it is she doesn't even drive to work <SIL> yknow <IVER>
so <IVER>
uh she's undecided right now <SIL> um <IVER>
right um-hum <SIL> at o yeah uh <IVER>
she really likes it well <SIL> yeah <IVER>
she went to <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> columbus alternative high school <IVER>
right um-hum <IVER>
uh college without the tuition <SIL> <IVER>
so hard <SIL> i mean <SIL> every summer <SIL> they have homework <SIL> that has to be done <SIL> or else the first grading period <SIL> is an f <SIL> and when <SIL> uh my <UNKNOWN> yeah oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and once she got into it she went <SIL> uh maybe not <LAUGH> so i said well what yknow whatever <SIL> so then she wanted to go to <EXCLUDE-name> because it's basically <SIL> a columbus <SIL> public school that's geared to <SIL> college only i mean if <SIL> if you're not going to college <SIL> don't go there because you will flunk out it's very hard <SIL> and she got in <SIL> the second year <SIL> three weeks before school started <SIL> and so we go over there and they hand her this stack of <SIL> material that's got to be done in three weeks <SIL> so i thought <SIL> well i'll just call and i called and i talked to the principal and i said yknow they gave us all this stuff and yknow <SIL> everybody else has had <SIL> june july <SIL> august to get this done and she's got three weeks and she goes <SIL> and the principal goes that's correct <SIL> and i go <SIL> well there's no way she can get this done and <CUTOFF-I=I> i said yknow everybody else has <SIL> had all this time and she's gonna get it done in three weeks and they go <SIL> that's right <SIL> so they take <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's no excuses <SIL> yknow <SIL> and it's <SIL> it is very hard i know my youngest daughter <SIL> who is just as smart as my oldest would do horrible there because <SIL> yknow basically they say uh we're talking about china this week <SIL> and uh <SIL> on december the fifteenth <SIL> we want a report on <SIL> why chinese people do what they do <SIL> yknow and it's like <SIL> and every week they don't come by and go have you started <SIL> have you started <SIL> have you started do you have the outline <VOCNOISE> right <SIL> and it's up to you to go gosh i have to have an outline i have to bibliography i have to have the facts i have to interview some people <SIL> and if you don't sit down with a little calendar and go <SIL> this week i'm getting this done this week i'm getting this done and this <SIL> you just <SIL> fail <SIL> so my oldest daughter <VOCNOISE> is <SIL> pretty uh <SIL> detail oriented so <SIL> after we kind of <CUTOFF-he=helped> <CUTOFF-h=helped> helped her start yknow and say yknow you're you're gonna hafta <SIL> do these things <SIL> so you get this done and i said and basically get it done like <SIL> two weeks before it's done so then you can say <SIL> oh <SIL> this isn't very good and <SIL> yknow amend it or whatever or <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> help somebody <SIL> yknow get somebody with typing whatever so she's really good and it's <SIL> it's helped her at school <SIL> a lot <SIL> because i know they <SIL> uh she <SIL> she toured here at ohio state and there were some people here that <CUTOFF-w=were> <SIL> come from cahs and they go <SIL> this will be easier than your highschool <LAUGH> <SIL> so <IVER>
hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
no because <SIL> um <SIL> all the kids take that <ERROR-CUTOFF-calivorn=california> <SIL> california achievement test i don't know if you're familiar with that and it's like yknow because <SIL> it's <SIL> say like you and i go to school you go to <SIL> you go to dublin and i go to the worst school in columbus <SIL> and we both make straight a's <SIL> well when you take the california achievement test <SIL> that really the <SIL> a's mean nothing <SIL> because it's like <SIL> let's see what you understand and have learned <SIL> the score on that is what really matters to me <SIL> and both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those <SIL> because yknow they always pick on <SIL> columbus public schools they go oh it's so look how bad their test scores <SIL> well <SIL> yknow <SIL> if you take <SIL> say like uh <SIL> the worst school in town which i don't know what it what it would be but lets just say it's uh <SIL> brown school <SIL> well you have <SIL> children there who have not seen dad in probably <SIL> ten years <SIL> and mom is <SIL> basically <SIL> sometimes there <SIL> or in prison so they live with grandma <SIL> how do you expect them to do well <SIL> nobody's there to yknow i'm not a uh <SIL> yknow like <SIL> an ogre or anything but yknow <SIL> i always keep <SIL> tabs on my kids yknow like i've always gone to conferences <SIL> even though they got straight a's <SIL> i go to conferences and teachers go well what do you come for and i go <SIL> if i don't come then it's like saying <SIL> i don't really care <SIL> so i always go <SIL> so they know that i'm <SIL> keeping tabs on things and i don't demand a's <SIL> i just demand them <SIL> to do their best and i said yknow if your best is a c then that's what it will be but i said if your best is an a and you're getting a c <SIL> you got me to talk to so <SIL> uh back to the brown school <SIL> uh there are kids like my daughter there who make <SIL> straight a's <SIL> and when they take the <SIL> um <SIL> what is that thing the proficiency test <SIL> zoom through it and get like outstanding on it <SIL> and uh then you have <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-thi=this> this probably sounds really <SIL> biased or <SIL> bigoted but <CUTOFF-y=you> then you have <SIL> the kid whose <SIL> mom and dad aren't together and <SIL> and he comes to school maybe <SIL> twice a week <SIL> and when he takes proficiency test he gets like a <VOCNOISE-th=thirty?> 
thirty on it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and his report card he's got like a one point two five average <SIL> so they take <SIL> jalena who has an a <SIL> him who has a d and they go well gee the average <CUTOFF-s=student> kid in the school is like c plus <SIL> and they're stupid at this school columbus public schools don't do any good <SIL> then you go to dublin worthington westerville <SIL> in order to get there you <SIL> you're not gonna be <SIL> in his condition <VOCNOISE> and you're not gonna be stupid because you're trying to <SIL> yknow <SIL> you probably both husband and wife work <SIL> so the intelligence is there <SIL> and you're not gonna have dumb people <SIL> living <SIL> and going to those schools because it's very expensive live in that area <SIL> so there's a natural prejudice that columbus is stupid <SIL> and worthington dublin and it's really <SIL> not true <SIL> it's just that <SIL> yknow <SIL> you can't <SIL> tell all the poor people <SIL> and the people that don't have <SIL> two parents don't come to school because we want our scores higher <SIL> but yknow when the <VOCNOISE> and when the news media goes look how bad brown school did this year <SIL> but they don't look to see <SIL> like jalena <SIL> they don't go well look at <SIL> the uh scores on the california achievement tests there's like <SIL> seventy five percent the kids that are getting like <SIL> yknow nineties and above <SIL> but twenty five percent are getting <SIL> f's and d's <IVER>
so it brings that <CUTOFF-do=down> and it's uh like yknow they're they're not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on <SIL> the test at both schools <SIL> i'll bet you they're all about the same <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> because like i think it's archie griffin that went to a really crummy school in uh <SIL> in in columbus <SIL> and to me <SIL> no matter how <SIL> bad of an area you live in and and <CUTOFF-ba=bad> bad a <CUTOFF-s=school> bad a school you think you're going to <SIL> if you want to do it <SIL> you can because it and <VOCNOISE> really in columbus public schools <SIL> if you have a learning disability <SIL> or yknow if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is <SIL> a psychologist <SIL> or a tutor or something to help you and <SIL> and in uh like <SIL> worthington and westerville dublin <SIL> yknow <SIL> they don't have the money to throw away and like catholic schools they don't have the money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get <SIL> pushed aside and <SIL> so yknow <SIL> as you can see i'm standing on my soapbox here i do like columbus public schools but yknow i <SIL> i i hate when people say yknow look at these test scores because it really doesn't reflect what's there because <SIL> it's like saying all kids carry guns to school <SIL> they don't <SIL> yknow and the media says well what has there been like maybe <SIL> five or six <SIL> people who have taken guns to school and killed people <SIL> well what about the uh <SIL> millions and millions of kids that go to school every day <SIL> do their homework <SIL> and yknow <SIL> do community service and stuff well well <UNKNOWN> well that's just to boring we don't want to hear that stuff <SIL> yknow <SIL> it's like <SIL> that that irritates me <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
there we go <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
uh they really have no self worth <SIL> because <SIL> yknow uh i uh i know a long time ago uh we went to a um <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-s=seminar> <SIL> what was <CUTOFF-tha=that> it's like a <UNKNOWN> a seminar <SIL> for the <SIL> ivy league schools which <SIL> i looked at the tuition and went <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow there was no way but <SIL> and i thought this is so stupid to be here but i listened to the man <SIL> <CUTOFF-the=there?> there was like four or five men talking and some women talking whatever and uh <SIL> they said yknow <SIL> if your <CUTOFF-k=kid> <SIL> if your child makes straight a's <SIL> and uh <SIL> applies at our school <SIL> we don't want them <SIL> and i'm like <SIL> what <SIL> he says uh <SIL> he says we look at two <SIL> two children sitting side by side this one's making straight a's <SIL> this one sort of made b's <SIL> but this one over here got into track when <SIL> he or she was in freshman's <SIL> and <SIL> and we noticed <SIL> every track meet <SIL> they basically <CUTOFF-wa=was> <SIL> were like <SIL> last <SIL> or second to last <SIL> but they did it for four years <SIL> then they <CUTOFF-w=were> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and and never got any better <SIL> then they got in marching band <SIL> and they were in that for four years <SIL> and sometimes we notice they marched and sometimes they didn't because they didn't learn their music <SIL> but they stayed with it <SIL> and they said then they like volunteered down at cosi <SIL> they didn't get paid a dime for this <SIL> but they did it because they enjoyed <SIL> helping and definite so like they go <SIL> we want that student over there <SIL> said you as a straight a student have proved nothing to us <SIL> and you over there as a b student have proved that <SIL> by gosh <SIL> yknow you'll try out for something <SIL> and if you don't do well you go <SIL> but i like doing it <SIL> and i'm gonna keep with it <SIL> yknow <SIL> and to me <SIL> the straight a student who does nothing <SIL> is like the kids who <SIL> go to school and shoot people <SIL> they have nothing in their life <SIL> at all and the other one has <SIL> yknow activities and <SIL> they're giving of themselves to the community yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library <CUTOFF-r=reading> <SIL> reading program and then they went on and they volunteer at cosi and <SIL> and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like <SIL> easter egg hunts for <SIL> the <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> school is a grade school and it's attached to <CUTOFF-Co=Columbus> <VOCNOISE> columbus alternative high school <SIL> so <SIL> um yknow i <CUTOFF-re=read> i read an <SIL> um <SIL> uh a uh resume that she <SIL> put in <SIL> for a scholarship and it was explaining how <SIL> the <SIL> the closest she got to crying at school was <SIL> when she would <SIL> uh <SIL> do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy <SIL> and <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> it was just <SIL> they were just so excited that <SIL> the kids went out and bought like a dollar or twos worth of candy and hid it out and they'd have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says <SIL> yknow those and things that <SIL> were important to her and <SIL> yknow <SIL> to me that makes <SIL> you feel like you're worth something but the kids that go yknow the ones who went to school i <SIL> yknow i don't see any <SIL> community service or <SIL> i don't know about <SIL> i i'm not a big <SIL> gung ho have to be religious person i mean i i feel i'm a christian but i'm not a church goer <SIL> and i don't think you hafta go there to be <SIL> a religious person <SIL> yknow but uh yknow i think <SIL> religion and community service and <SIL> feeling like you have given something to the community and <SIL> yknow you're just not <SIL> asking continuously for it yknow and and trying things <SIL> and failing at them <SIL> and going okay well <SIL> but i still like to <SIL> play basketball <SIL> i'm <SIL> terrible but i like to play and i can't make the team so what do i do i know i'll go to the y and play there <SIL> yknow <SIL> that <SIL> that's <SIL> what keeps kids out of trouble <SIL> and those that go to school and come home and either sit on the computer and <SIL> yknow what <SIL> do the chat room stuff or the e mail stuff or sit on the playing with video games i think those the ones that are the big problem children because they yknow mom and dad go <SIL> how can i get them to do something <SIL> and stay out of my hair <SIL> oh i know i'll buy them a nintendo <SIL> i'll buy them this sega i'll buy this look they're out of my way yknow because <SIL> yknow <IVER>

yeah that and i think <SIL> i i'm a firm believer that uh <SIL> little subtleties like that to yourself <SIL> are much better than look in the mirror and going <SIL> look at them hips <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you go this one you go <SIL> i'm getting a gut <SIL> and yknow it's like that's so negative to <CUTOFF-yoursel=yourself> would you <SIL> tell your <SIL> mom that <SIL> yknow <IVER>

<NOISE> i'm sitting here now scott i bet you on monday nights game tonight nine o'clock la la la so and so will win <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow and we <SIL> don't <SIL> exchange any money or have any money figures planned out just <SIL> yknow <SIL> oh well that's your team that's <SIL> my team lets <SIL> go at it <UNKNOWN-and> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it makes it <SIL> yknow fun so you can <SIL> actually see what <SIL> yknow your <SIL> studying these teams <SIL> does yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you can go a whole season <SIL> yknow seventeen eighteen and o <SIL> and <SIL> nobody's <SIL> pretty much coming close to your standard and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when you win all that money it's just like yeah when you lose all that money it's like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's it <SIL> <LAUGH-I'm> going home <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> but <SIL> i've known people that gamble <SIL> yknow compulsively <SIL> i mean it's like a <CUTOFF-g=gambler> <SIL> gamblers anonymous <SIL> level <SIL> i couldn't really get into that <SIL> number one i'm not the richest person in the world and number two <SIL> just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> little money here is one thing but <SIL> when you're <CUTOFF-j=just> <SIL> out there spending your <SIL> car insurance money on it or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> rent money then <SIL> you got a real problem there <SIL> i've seen guys do that to <SIL> go down to scioto downs and bet the <SIL> bet the farm on <SIL> one horse and <SIL> wouldn't even do anything for them <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> well you got the <SIL> casinos <SIL> river boat casinos open you got <SIL> all the <SIL> pretty much every <SIL> store on the corners got a <SIL> lottery machine or <SIL> tickets <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> i think it is a good idea because i've won my fair share of money <LAUGH-on_the_lottery> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they give everybody a fair chance yknow they don't <SIL> just <SIL> minimize it to one or two <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> some of them have options <SIL> and some of them don't <SIL> <IVER>
yeah it's <SIL> just like uh <SIL> having alcohol around <SIL> mean <SIL> gambling is a lot like alcohol it can be addicting it can screw your life up and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you'll spend your last dollar on it if you're that far gone <SIL> so pretty much anything can be <SIL> one of those factors <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> well most people think it's <SIL> something they rely on like <SIL> well the <UNKNOWN> <SIL> money getting <SIL> from the lottery to the people or <SIL> lottery to schools <VOCNOISE> <SIL> on that issue then yeah i <SIL> i agree with <SIL> the gambling thing <SIL> yknow <SIL> just as long as it's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like <SIL> social drinking <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in a sense <SIL> because if you have people just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> go out <SIL> like today i <CUTOFF-b=bought> <SIL> i bought a one dollar lottery ticket won two bucks off of it <SIL> so i kept my one dollar and uh <SIL> got a one dollar added on <SIL> yeah there's <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <SIL> and then <SIL> then there's these um <NOISE> little bit more expensive cards you buy the <SIL> lottery cards <SIL> one of them's called battleship that i've <SIL> won <SIL> lot of money off of <IVER>

<SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> that could really bite you in the back though <SIL> winning all that money <SIL> i'd be <SIL> well i'd be <SIL> quite content with one million dollars but <SIL> ten million dollars is kind of like over kill <SIL> <LAUGH> i mean do you think anybody in this town has ten million dollars <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> <SIL> maybe a couple <SIL> people <LAUGH-couple_of_people_yes> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<SIL> and this is my consent <SIL> to let you use that <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>

<SIL> yeah one's a <SIL> alternative school and the other one's just a <SIL> regular trashy public school <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> well <SIL> this is about giving opinions and <SIL> my opinion about the columbus public school system really <SIL> isn't good <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> well because i've been in public schools all my life and i should be <SIL> first to know that there's uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lot of <UNKNOWN> <SIL> favoritism <SIL> yknow <SIL> some <SIL> some teachers will <SIL> teach <SIL> one but not teach the other <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> well if <IVER>
yeah teach one person <SIL> one thing <SIL> and <SIL> not teach the other person that <SIL> kind of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> let me see here <SIL> give an example there's uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's a school that they showed on twenty twenty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> somewhere out west <SIL> i believe it's nevada or somewhere <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they said that <SIL> these uh <SIL> teachers have the highest rating <SIL> among <SIL> many other teachers <SIL> in the nation because of their <SIL> actual <SIL> sitting down and hands on <SIL> critiquing these children <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ex girlfriend of mine <SIL> she was <SIL> pretty much <SIL> i wouldn't <SIL> put her borderline illiterate <SIL> but <SIL> she didn't know how to read or write 
<SIL> very well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> yknow her <SIL> vocabulary's limited and <SIL> she didn't know how to <UNKNOWN> <SIL> spell or <SIL> know any <SIL> bigger words <SIL> so i tried to sit her down and <SIL> yknow give her a little refresher and <SIL> yknow it's <SIL> coming from <SIL> a new jersey public school <SIL> and <SIL> doing a study then <SIL> yknow <SIL> couple these different <SIL> places <SIL> you never even hear of <SIL> like <SIL> i don't know cow pow kentucky or <LAUGH> <SIL> wherever you want it <SIL> yknow some small town would have <SIL> this great <SIL> teaching <IVER>
no <SIL> and other towns <SIL> just don't <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> not <SIL> really national system it's already <SIL> been put to national <SIL> if they rate them <SIL> state to state <SIL> and city to city <SIL> but <SIL> on <SIL> on the level of the <SIL> actual needs of the student <SIL> yknow you can't just put down <SIL> yknow <SIL> a book and say i want you to <SIL> put five hundred words on this page why you like this <SIL> or dislike this book <SIL> i mean <SIL> one person can do it <SIL> and another one <SIL> mean you could probably write about <SIL> thousand words <SIL> on a page right now about psychology <SIL> because of your how many years do you have <SIL> two <SIL> three <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay so <SIL> you're <UNKNOWN> <SIL> you're higher up there than <SIL> i would be <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> when's your p h d come in <SIL> uh <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> all right <IVER>
that's about same time my friend got hers <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah she went down to western missouri <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah just had to leave me here <SIL> we've been best friends for so many years <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> oh hell yeah look at you <LAUGH-man> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> you hoosier <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> yeah so uh <SIL> things pretty much in columbus public schools yknow they don't <SIL> they don't actually sit down with <SIL> you <SIL> they <SIL> automatically assume that once you get to this level you're ready for this level and <SIL> you go on <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> well the p s a t's and the <SIL> yknow <SIL> just <SIL> all those centralized <SIL> scoring systems they have <SIL> they <CUTOFF-th=they> <SIL> they pretty much told me that <SIL> yknow my scores <SIL> when i was in <SIL> what was it <SIL> fifth grade <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah fifth grade they said that i was <SIL> i had a high i q <SIL> and <SIL> i could be doctor lawyer ya da ya ya da i don't <IVER>
<SIL> trying to <SIL> raise my hopes up about it but then <SIL> they had this other kid <SIL> who was actually really <SIL> into <SIL> veterinary medicine and flying helicopters and all that <SIL> and he really did go on to uh <SIL> study about that <SIL> myself <SIL> cook <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> but <IVER>
<SIL> well they pretty much put <SIL> by the test scores they don't sit you down like in <SIL> private schools they do this <SIL> they sit you down one to one <SIL> just like we are <SIL> and they spend probably <SIL> yknow maybe <VOCNOISE> <SIL> twenty thirty minutes a day <SIL> actually getting to know the student <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what the student still needs for the <SIL> completion of that grade <SIL> and <SIL> once they've figured that <SIL> you're <SIL> able to go there <SIL> then <SIL> up you go <SIL> right up the ladder <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> no it's <SIL> it's kind of like um <SIL> you go to a private school and you get there <VOCNOISE> maybe seven years old <SIL> on up to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fifteen sixteen <SIL> <SIL> and at sixteen they can <SIL> actually determine <SIL> give you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a test and <SIL> sit down with you and ask you about <SIL> different things <SIL> and <SIL> sixteen <SIL> fifteen sixteen year old could actually graduate from <SIL> college <SIL> yknow be <SIL> yeah they've <SIL> <CUTOFF-sh=showed> <VOCNOISE> they've showed that study already <SIL> i mean i think it's <SIL> i think it's amazing <SIL> yeah <SIL> i mean <SIL> when i first heard about it i said uh some doogie howser shit <SIL> yknow <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> but now it's just <SIL> yknow <SIL> now it's <SIL> kind of reality yknow because i know <SIL> pretty much <SIL> a lot of skilled <CUTOFF-j=jobs> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> skilled trades <SIL> i know how to cook <SIL> pretty much know how to handle myself <SIL> out in the <SIL> wilderness <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> mean <SIL> yknow go up on nature hikes and <SIL> go fishing <SIL> all that stuff just combines into one <SIL> it's all about being an individual <SIL> and if those teachers can't study with that individual <SIL> know what that individual wants <SIL> young <SIL> then <SIL> older <SIL> kids not gonna know what to do <SIL> end up <SIL> practicing law and not liking it <SIL> going to all that school for it <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> well a little bit near the beginning and that was pretty miserable but it's been <SIL> it's been a while <LAUGH-from_there> so it that's not something that <VOCNOISE> that <CUTOFF-r=right> <SIL> right now i've had any <SIL> anything like that so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
really <IVER>
really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> oh <IVER>
really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-back_to_bed_rest_really> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right wow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
huh <IVER>
yeah i've <CUTOFF-got=gotten> i've <ERROR-gottenen=gotten> plenty of <LAUGH-peopuh=people> <LAUGH> it's funny jason's mom asks me <VOCNOISE> so is your mom gonna come and stay with <LAUGH-you_for_a_week> i said no <LAUGH> i told my mom she started laughing <VOCNOISE> because <HES-I> <SIL> i mean <HES-of> <SIL> of course <HES-uh> for her to come over and help out <SIL> is terrific but if she actually stayed at my house for a week i think we'd just kill <LAUGH-each_other> <IVER>
um about fifteen <LAUGH-minutes> my mom and i don't go to far <LAUGH-from_each_other_so> <SIL> but jason's gonna take the week off and everything so i think that we'll <VOCNOISE> we'll be able to do that <IVER>
o s u <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> well we didn't we didn't find out we had a <HES-um> <SIL> i don't know we figured we'd just wait and be surprised is that what you guys did <IVER>
yeah we had a <HES-ah> my mom has a friend that does ultrasounds <IVER>
at um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think it was mount carmel we went over the weekend <SIL> and we went there saturday morning and i've got this forty five minute ultrasound tape of the baby which is cute because <VOCNOISE> you can only see parts of it but you can really <CUTOFF-s=see> you can see its face you can see what it looks like and everything but i said i don't wanna know the sex <SIL> and it's so hard to <VOCNOISE> because we're looking of course we're going through this tape trying to see if we can see anything and you just <CUTOFF-kae=can't> you just can't tell i think she was real careful to make sure that <VOCNOISE> that we wouldn't be able to she says i know what it is but i said <VOCNOISE> um alright well just don't tell us so <SIL> so that was kinda neat then <IVER>
we've got girls names <VOCNOISE> so we've got either sydney or mackenzie for a girl <SIL> and then <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well thank <LAUGH-you> <LAUGH> i <CUTOFF-li=like> yeah i think <HES-I> think <HES-that> that we both <VOCNOISE> this <HES-I> think <CUTOFF-t=to> to collectively together i know jason likes sydney a little bit better <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> i don't know about boys names <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i just <VOCNOISE> well he said one like when i was about three months that we both really liked but that wasn't really names weren't really what we were thinking about then <IVER>
neither one of us can remember it <SIL> <LAUGH-so_I_don't_know> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
aw <IVER>
uh-huh <VOCNOISE> uh-huh <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i figure when the time comes we'll just have to figure it <LAUGH-out> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-right> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
aw that's nice <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh my goodness <IVER>
oh she's a cute <VOCNOISE> she really is really cute i mean i mean she's got big eyes and big fluffy cheeks <IVER>
she is she's adorable <VOCNOISE> how <HES-old> is she in this picture <IVER>
really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> goodness can't get away from her <LAUGH-can_you> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <IVER>
aren't you holding it <IVER>
oh the <LAUGH-top> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-you_lost_your_pen> <IVER>
hm <SIL> <IVER>
yeah i was <HES-and> because <VOCNOISE> where i was <CUTOFF-w=working> i was working at a <ERROR-grecruiting=recruiting> firm and we were doing we had a lot of business before <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> and <HES-I> <HES-was> i <VOCNOISE> was pretty sick during <HES-the> during the morning and afternoon part and basically <VOCNOISE> yknow we talked about it and <HES-I> just decided to go ahead and just take some time off <HES-and> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i also went back to school then too <SIL> so i figured i'd take that time off and i <HES-went> <HES-I'm> going to otterbein <VOCNOISE> to get my masters in education <IVER>
so we're kinda doing that and then i figure i'm probably gonna <VOCNOISE> wait tables at night <LAUGH> and and finish going to school during the day so <IVER>
i got a job <HES-at> at hyde park <VOCNOISE> so that'll <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> it's just amazing because the money's so good yknow you really can't beat it i only have to work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and whatever <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> hyde park <SIL> grill <VOCNOISE> it's uh <VOCNOISE> it's a restaurant it's up in dublin <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> i don't know i mean i <CUTOFF-d=did> <HES-I> did that all through high school and college and after i <CUTOFF-g=graduated> actually after i graduated from high school i managed a restaurant for about a year and a half <IVER>
so i mean <VOCNOISE> it's something <HES-I'm> i'm comfortable with <IVER>
the hours <CUTOFF-with=with> <VOCNOISE> because jason works during the day too so it will probably work out pretty well for us <IVER>
just wanna get <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i'm <VOCNOISE> figuring <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> middle of january <VOCNOISE> is my guess i'll go uh <VOCNOISE> school starts i think the fifth of january <SIL> and then i'm gonna go that <VOCNOISE> i don't know well i <CUTOFF-thi=think> it's weird because <HES-I've> had a job since i was fourteen <IVER>
and this is the first time in my whole life <VOCNOISE> that i haven't been working and it's just like <VOCNOISE> my mom and i go out to lunch and we go to breakfast <UNKNOWN> what'd you do today well <NOISE-let's> see i went to breakfast with my mom and then amy and i went to lunch and then we <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <CUTOFF-we=went> actually i <CUTOFF-w=we> <SIL> we moved about <CUTOFF-f=four> three months ago so i've been kinda doing a lot of stuff at our place so that's nice i mean <VOCNOISE> had a lot of time to get everything wallpapered and painted <EXT-and> and just do all those kinds of things but <VOCNOISE> it's weird yknow because i don't have to get up in the morning and i feel guilty yknow he leaves at six thirty or seven and i'm going <SIL> bye <LAUGH> <LAUGH-have_a_nice_day_yknow_and_i'm> <VOCNOISE> still sleeping which is <VOCNOISE> right now is really good because i have a hard time sleeping at night <SIL> and after he leaves <VOCNOISE> it's wonderful because i <CUTOFF-s=sleep> can sleep in till about ten thirty and i feel a lot better <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-nothing_worked_out> 
<IVER>
she has <SIL> no she hasn't worked since <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my sister megan was born and megan is twenty <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she but the thing is i've got another i've got a <CUTOFF-s=sister> <HES-a> sister my sister megan <HES-um> <EXT-Joe> is my brother he's fifteen and a half and then i have a sister vanessa who's twelve <IVER>
so i mean <SIL> it's not like there aren't young kids still there i mean and she does stuff like <VOCNOISE> lots of things with school yknow she runs all the school candy sales and she does like lots of p t a she was p t a president <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> she also likes to remodel houses so if there's a house that comes up she'll buy it and fix it up and <VOCNOISE> and yknow she makes <SIL> yknow twenty thousand dollars a year <SIL> <VOCNOISE> on the side doing that she likes to do it and <IVER>
she figures well yknow that kind of makes up for me not working <CUTOFF-s=so> <HES-so> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah it's true and she likes it she's really good at it and <SIL> <HES-and> drives my <CUTOFF-s=stepdad> <SIL> my stepdad <LAUGH-crazy> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-because> because she'll always be like <VOCNOISE> hey pete can you come over and put these cabinets <LAUGH-in_yknow> he says i don't wanna do <LAUGH-anything_else> <SIL> but um <IVER>
she no she <CUTOFF-sh=she> <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> she's kinda the <CUTOFF-d=?> well she does all the painting and wallpapering and like all that kind of stuff but as far as the carpentry work we have <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> this one guy that's been doing stuff for our house for a long time or <IVER>
she'll make <SIL> she'll make pete go over and do it <LAUGH> <LAUGH-not_like_he_has_a_lot_of_choice> <LAUGH> no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <IVER>
usually clintonville my mom <VOCNOISE> she um <SIL> she doesn't she's not a big fan of driving <VOCNOISE> she doesn't really drive very much which is good i've ridden in a car with her one time and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it just she just would prefer not to and <HES-we> that's okay with us because she's she's got a drivers license for i d and those types of things but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for the most part so she kinda stays like clintonville area <IVER>
which is <HES-um> <SIL> which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of roses <VOCNOISE> and those <NOISE-types> of things you can get some that are <VOCNOISE> older that need <VOCNOISE> <HES-that> need a lot of work but that's a pretty high demand area <IVER>
so <SIL> that works out pretty well <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah so that's pretty much what she likes to do <IVER>
yeah <SIL> it is it's nice <SIL> it works out well <IVER>
my mom <IVER>
yeah she's <LAUGH-already> <LAUGH> i didn't think she'd have it any other way <IVER>
<LAUGH> well the thing <HES-I> mean i know when my mom <VOCNOISE> my mom has a friend that adopted <IVER>
a baby <SIL> um a biracial baby which <CUTOFF-w=worked> <SIL> worked out well he is <CUTOFF-ji=just> just is the sweetest kid in the whole world <VOCNOISE> and <HES-uh> <SIL> um <SIL> and my mom's friend colin is a teacher and she watched jessie for <VOCNOISE> a good three year during the <CUTOFF-da=day> i mean oh colin paid her obviously <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i mean and she really she really enjoyed that yknow something that she could do at home yknow she wanted to go out and run errands she could take jessie with her <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> and that was <CUTOFF-ha=?> and that worked out well <VOCNOISE> but i think too like with my school schedule yknow if i'm just in class <VOCNOISE> maybe <VOCNOISE> yknow three four days a week <VOCNOISE> and then the rest the time in the evening jason will be there so it's not like i'm relying on her <VOCNOISE> every single day <CUTOFF-a=all> <VOCNOISE> all the time to do that and i really wouldn't wanna put my child in daycare <IVER>
that would just be too scary for me <IVER>
really <IVER>
<EXT-um> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> how'd you do this to <LAUGH-me> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
does it <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
em <VOCNOISE> aw that's nice <VOCNOISE> yeah i'm sure <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
i think sometimes you there's a tradeoff between <VOCNOISE> time and money and you just have to look at it and say which is really more important <IVER>
absolutely <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i know that they changed it i know that it used to just be one day i guess because of the healthcare <VOCNOISE> something like that <HES-I> <HES-I> i feel like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a day and a half certainly would be long enough for me i mean unless there's some type of complications <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i would be <LAUGH-perfectly_ready_to_go_home> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-unle=unless> unless there's something extra that they could do for me there <IVER>
and <HES-and> then i would expect that if there was a problem that they would make sure <CUTOFF-tha=that> that they kept me there but i think a day and a half is perfectly reasonable <VOCNOISE> i mean i <HES-don't> <SIL> i don't <CUTOFF-n=know> <SIL> i don't know i've never done this <LAUGH-before_so> i can't really say <VOCNOISE> but i mean <VOCNOISE> my feeling is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the least <LAUGH-amount_of_time> i have to be in the hospital <LAUGH-the_happier_i'm_gonna_be> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah that's true well we <CUTOFF-wen=went> o s u's and they've got a nice facility i mean they have uh <VOCNOISE> uh <CUTOFF-d=?> uh <CUTOFF-wv=?> <SIL> like a labor and delivery room it's got like <VOCNOISE> it's weird though because when you go they show you they they talk about all this whirlpool bath thing a room with it i don't know if you've heard those commercials or not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <CUTOFF-there=there's> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's only one room that's like that <IVER>
and it's <SIL> interesting that they <SIL> advertise that when you go there though <VOCNOISE> if you get that room that's what you get <IVER>
if not you just get the <CUTOFF-re=regular> <VOCNOISE> the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff <VOCNOISE> but it's <SIL> interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like <VOCNOISE> there's this huge place and you're gonna get that no matter <EXT-what> and this and that <VOCNOISE> but when you actually go and look around it kind of <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
little different <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-it=it> <IVER>
yeah it's well basically it's like a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's about the size of a <ERROR-s=small> very small hotel room and then it's got a separate bathroom with like a big bathtub <VOCNOISE> and there's like <HES-a> they there like oh it's aroma therapy which is a little box on the wall about this big that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean there's enough room where people can come and sit down there's like a fold out <VOCNOISE> couch bed for whoever's in there with you and then they've got the baby <VOCNOISE> they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it's born <IVER>
which i think is kinda nice <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-mea=mean> <HES-it> looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable <VOCNOISE> i mean my biggest thing is i just wanna have a room to all myself yknow i don't wanna go some place where i'm gonna <LAUGH-have> to like deal with <LAUGH-somebody_else_in_there> <VOCNOISE> so i mean it looks <SIL> it looks nice but <VOCNOISE> i would be more comfortable at home i think once i go home <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i figure <VOCNOISE> there'll be plenty of <CUTOFF-pe=people> i told my mom i just want green jello you <LAUGH-just> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-she's_gonna_make_me_snacks> <LAUGH> oh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know it just sounds like it would be something that i would have to have it's just necessary <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <IVER>
really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
to the other side <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i'm <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
no that's interesting though because i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think <HES-that> <HES-um> that my whole <HES-I> i mean i always still <CUTOFF-fuh=feel> i still feel like i'm <EXT-just> <IVER>
yknow i'm just one of the kids hi mom yknow <VOCNOISE> yknow <HES-and> <HES-and> i guess it's true and i've always wondered <VOCNOISE> yknow i turned eighteen and i thought <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well shouldn't i feel like an adult now <VOCNOISE> yknow i was twenty one shouldn't i start to feel like this responsible twenty five shouldn't i be an adult <VOCNOISE> yknow and i wonder <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at what point do you really feel like you're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you are on that other side or you're one of the grown up people instead of one of the little <NOISE-people> and maybe <VOCNOISE> <SIL> maybe that's maybe that's one i mean <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH-I_don't_it_is> <LAUGH> well that's fair maybe that's true too i mean i don't feel <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> because you know when you're younger you think oh my god twenty seven <VOCNOISE> that's so old you must be yknow and now that you're here you're like guys i <CUTOFF-z=feel> <SIL> i feel fine i don't feel <LAUGH-like> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-right> <LAUGH> little more responsible but other than <LAUGH-that> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
really <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
huh <VOCNOISE> i have to wait i guess a couple weeks i'll be <LAUGH-having_to_tell_you> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well the thing is in lamaze they show you those <CUTOFF-ta=tapes?> i'm sure you guys took those classes <VOCNOISE> they're horrible they take seventeen hours of labor they put it into six minutes and you think <VOCNOISE> oh my <EXT-God> i'm gonna <EXT-die> yknow these women are like i just want to die <LAUGH-you_know_and_you're_like> why are you showing me <CUTOFF-thi-this> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i said <HES-I> didn't want to see that yknow i would much rather just <VOCNOISE> have my own opinion of what it's gonna be like yknow and go by <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what other people said 
<SIL> my mom never had an epidural jason's mom never had an <CUTOFF-ep=epidural> <SIL> yknow and that looks worse to me did you see that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it takes twenty minutes they thread this thing this needle in your back they put this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that sounds worse to me than even <VOCNOISE> having a baby <LAUGH-I_just_can't_I> <CUTOFF-sai=said> <SIL> i don't want anything in my back <LAUGH> <LAUGH-so> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i guess it's true you just have to wait and see once you get there <SIL> what happens <IVER>
see that's great though <IVER>
was it hard <IVER>
really <IVER>
<EXT-oh> <IVER>
hmm <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
uh-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> really see we almost think that that would be better but when you put it like that it <CUTOFF-cer=certainly> certainly <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
yeah that's true that's a pretty good analogy <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
hm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> something to think about <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh the <CUTOFF-v=video> it was the <CUTOFF-vide=video> the <CUTOFF-v=video> the video tapes that i didn't like <VOCNOISE> it wasn't the class that was <CUTOFF-ski=?> the class was kinda goofy <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> it was that and watching the cesareans which i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm not a <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh yeah they showed they cut open the they're pulling this baby out of this little hole of this ladies stomach and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i had a heart surgery when i was younger <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so i've had lots of needles and those types of things and i when it comes to needles <HES-and> and that kinda stuff <VOCNOISE> i'm just kind of squeamish about it <SIL> yknow so that stuff i just <NOISE> <SIL> i just don't want to see it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i mean it's not <SIL> i mean it was a <VOCNOISE> really long time ago <SIL> everything's fine <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i guess <SIL> for me i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-it> <HES-it> <SIL> i don't know it's just it's just a little more a little more than i wanted to see <VOCNOISE> but the classes i think were helpful <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <VOCNOISE> what'd you ask me <IVER>
oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i think <SIL> i think they'll be very helpful <HES-um> <SIL> i was going to o s u for <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> to deliver the baby so i decided to take the classes there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and basically <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my mom had reminded me over and over again sarah you need to schedule <CUTOFF-er=your> lamaze classes so i called o s u and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i scheduled them <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah jason and and i and i went together <IVER>
and basically they were three weeks long they were about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> four and a half hours <SIL> the first one was <SIL> really long <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow jason was <VOCNOISE> he's i can't take this <LAUGH> last night wasn't so bad though i mean the first one was a lot of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lot of <SIL> information classroom kind of stuff but <VOCNOISE> he did real well he was much <HES-uh> he's just a <CUTOFF-sweet=sweetheart?> he's just wonderful he was much more interactive <HES-then> than a lot of the other guys were just kinda <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they would sit there and they weren't breathing and they were kinda rolling their eyes and i just think god you bunch of bums yknow it's gonna come down to it yknow and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you're gonna be so awful and he's just <SIL> real supportive and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and just <VOCNOISE> he's just terrific <LAUGH-so> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-it_makes_it> does <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it makes it better <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yep <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <LAUGH-you're_doing_fine> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the parenting stuff they gave us a video to watch at home which was things like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> how to diaper your <EXT-baby> <EXT-um> <SIL> a thing about whether you should leave them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> crying in their in their bassinet or crib which of course <SIL> <HES-I> think is horrible and i think it's good that they've come out with all these new studies that tell people don't do that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> lets see what else was there <VOCNOISE> feeding your <CUTOFF-baby=baby> i mean it just <IVER>
that kind of stuff <VOCNOISE> so it was mostly <CUTOFF-th=?> like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what we would do is we would talk about <VOCNOISE> we'd talk about like <EXT-medication> like as far as while you're in labor <IVER>
uh breast feeding <VOCNOISE> there was a lot of that <VOCNOISE> i could tell these poor guys are like uh <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-can_we_not_talk_about_this> yknow they were all kind of uncomfortable <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
and then <VOCNOISE> like lets see <CUTOFF-w=?> <SIL> a lot of it was <HES-I> mean <VOCNOISE> most of it was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was <CUTOFF-y=yknow> like <VOCNOISE> pre <EXT-labor> and then there was the breathing that we did at the end but other than the video <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was mostly like labor related <IVER>
they tie it with <VOCNOISE> it was all very pro breast <CUTOFF-fee=feed> you could tell you could really tell that they had an opinion about this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> we talked about positives and negatives of breast feeding things about <VOCNOISE> um <CUTOFF-he=he> like the immune <CUTOFF-syste=system> some of that stuff i already knew <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they had this thing about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the nurse said that there have been studies done where babies that have been breast fed have higher i q's <IVER>
which <VOCNOISE> i <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she said that and i said <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
are you <EXT-sure> <HES-I> <IVER>
i was <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
and that's the way i felt about it <HES-not> i'm not saying that that's not a possibility but <IVER>
<SIL> for someone to actually state <SIL> in a class <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you breast feed your baby they're gonna have a higher i q than if you don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <HES-thought> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum the bonding <IVER>
or <IVER>
breast feeding <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right and i think that yknow i think that it's just because yknow <HES-you> <SIL> do so because i know i've done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way <VOCNOISE> and i think a lot of these people just <VOCNOISE> yknow they <HES-say> <VOCNOISE> the nurse says something you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kinda strange but i mean <VOCNOISE> i think there's a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that it <VOCNOISE> i would want to do it for <VOCNOISE> for a while as long as i could <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
really <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> really <IVER>
really <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
huh <IVER>
that's different <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
hm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she's okay right <IVER>
<LAUGH-oh_no> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-wow> <IVER>
well sure <IVER>
<LAUGH-sure> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
really <IVER>
huh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-the=that> we didn't really get <VOCNOISE> the the video tape they gave us was half infomercials <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then <LAUGH> <LAUGH-things_like> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> things like how to clean the umbilical <CUTOFF-chor=chord> i mean <VOCNOISE> stuff like that but you're <CUTOFF-b=?> <CUTOFF-you=you're> <SIL> as far as actual parenting things on it there was really nothing <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
even in the package of information <IVER>
they gave us <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think it would probably <HES-I> i think it would be certainly interesting 
<SIL> for people to read i think there's enough other resources out there if somebody's interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i know <HES-for> for me <VOCNOISE> just because <VOCNOISE> i have so many younger brothers and sisters <EXT-and> <EXT-and> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <LAUGH-family_and> everything i know how <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i've got <HES-some> some <SIL> <HES-some> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-pret=pretty> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-pret=pretty> what i feel are pretty good opinions about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> how to handle different things and i know that my mom <VOCNOISE> always consults me yknow like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my sister <VOCNOISE> yknow she got her the d in french which vanessa is just <VOCNOISE> she's <VOCNOISE> this girl is almost creepy she's so bright <SIL> i mean she <EXT-really> is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> thing is one of those things were she just doesn't turn in her stuff <SIL> yknow and if <VOCNOISE> she's twelve <IVER>
<EXT-and> <SIL> it <SIL> <EXT-it's> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=yknow> yknow my mom yknow she always <UNKNOWN-tells_people_what_should_we> yknow what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things <VOCNOISE> so i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think it's kinda neat that i've been involved in a lot of <VOCNOISE> a lot of the other kids <SIL> that way <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know i think you just kinda deal with it when it gets here though <IVER>
but <SIL> yknow i think one of the things that you see people do a lot <HES-that> really bothers me is that whole thing about <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think you <CUTOFF-ha=have> just have to treat children like they're <EXT-just> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <VOCNOISE> just you have to respect them and you have to not not talk down to them and and that whole thing about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow why can't i do this well because i told you so <IVER>
yknow what <LAUGH-kind_of_an_answer> is that <SIL> even if your answer is <VOCNOISE> i don't know why you can't do it it just makes me uncomfortable <VOCNOISE> yknow that's a <EXT-lot> more fair than because i'm the boss of you or something like that and i think if you respect your kids <VOCNOISE> and and just kinda set boundaries with them <VOCNOISE> yknow kinda try to be <VOCNOISE> i don't know that's the way <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> that's the way my family's always been and it always seems to work really well for us <IVER>
no yeah <LAUGH=because_it_changes> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH=okay> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah_really> <LAUGH> <SIL> aw <IVER>
hum <VOCNOISE> is it hard to keep up with her <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
wow <IVER>
right <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> look at her <EXT-she's> so terrific <LAUGH> <LAUGH-watch_her_go> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
if yup we stay here <SIL> <CUTOFF=probab=prabaly> probably <IVER>
mm-hmm <SIL> i went to private schools for <HES-a> long time <IVER>
hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't think that i would have them go to any <LAUGH> i learned things like <VOCNOISE> how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party <VOCNOISE> that kind of stuff <SIL> was a lot more <LAUGH=focused-than> <VOCNOISE> i mean i didn't even i don't think anybody even taught me how to write in cursive other than my parents <VOCNOISE> so i mean it was <VOCNOISE> <HES-it> it was interesting i mean it was a lot more cultural kind of <CUTOFF-s=?> <VOCNOISE> kinds of things you do a lot of <VOCNOISE> things with nature and and that kind of <CUTOFF-s=stuff> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> was <SIL> the seventies too so i mean you <LAUGH-have_to_look_at_the_time> what we're talking about <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i've <HES-uh> i feel like <VOCNOISE> i don't see why <HES-I> i wouldn't send them to public schools <IVER>
i mean <HES-I> <HES-uh> obviously that's a long ways off <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <HES-I> <HES-I> i guess i imagine i would be teaching in <LAUGH-public_school_so_hopefully_I_could_try_to_get_them_where_I_was_but> <VOCNOISE> but <HES-I> <SIL> i don't know i mean maybe <VOCNOISE> i don't is that <HES-I> i don't even know if <CUTOFF-t=?> is dublin really better <LAUGH-than> <VOCNOISE> than <VOCNOISE> columbus public or <IVER>
i think they've got more money <VOCNOISE> i don't know if that necessarily makes them a better school <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think a lot of it is <SIL> is is really what <HES-you> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <HES-what> <HES-uh> <SIL> as far <HES-as> as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it <VOCNOISE> yknow <HES-my> my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and <VOCNOISE> and they took advanced <VOCNOISE> a p classes <HES-and> and they worked real hard and <VOCNOISE> and they've got i think that they have options <IVER>
that you really <EXT-can> get a lot out of it if that's something you want to do <VOCNOISE> and i think as long as you're involved with the school <IVER>
makes and just keep an eye on what's going on <IVER>
then you're really gonna get out of it what you need to <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
really <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> both <SIL> my whole family all graduated megan was <VOCNOISE> first in her class joe's ranked first my brother philips <CUTOFF-ra=rank> i uh was <LAUGH-not_however> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yknow_but> they're all they're all straight four <CUTOFF-por=point> <IVER>
that's <LAUGH-right> <LAUGH> straight four point o <SIL> kids but <VOCNOISE> it's true yknow and and they really <VOCNOISE> my mom really has <CUTOFF-work=worked> <VOCNOISE> worked with them to make sure that <VOCNOISE> that they get into some programs that they need and they're some things now i think that they're developing that they didn't have before <IVER>
some different types of of courses and those types of things so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my family <VOCNOISE> he's so funny because my parents are so you would never put them together now yknow <HES-uh> <HES-it> back then <VOCNOISE> yknow my <HES-my> well you saw my <CUTOFF-mo=mom> <HES-oh> no you didn't see her <HES-oh> you <LAUGH-did> <VOCNOISE> she's cute she's got a little hair cut she's all like <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> but um <IVER>
she is she's wonderful but <CUTOFF-y=you> <CUTOFF-bu=but> back then they were there was the sixties and they were hippies and <VOCNOISE> yknow my moms got long jet black hair and they're <CUTOFF-w=wearing> <VOCNOISE> wearing their army outfits and they're <VOCNOISE> whatever yknow everybody's got bellbottoms and my dads got long hair down to here <VOCNOISE> and everything so they lived like seventeenth avenue for a while <VOCNOISE> and we lived um <SIL> like i said on summit <SIL> until i was about three years <EXT-old> <VOCNOISE> and then they split up for a little bit and got back together <VOCNOISE> and my mom and i lived some place on campus in just a little one room apartment it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends <VOCNOISE> which <HES-was> <VOCNOISE> which was <SIL> which <VOCNOISE> great for me i mean <CUTOFF-everybo=everybody> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> my dad and i would do fun <EXT-stuff> my mom and i would do fun stuff and it <VOCNOISE> and <EXT-and> <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-don=don't> i never remember it being negative <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <EXT-remember> it being <VOCNOISE> it's a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they weren't together <VOCNOISE> because they all <VOCNOISE> both gave me a lot of attention <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> <EXT-about> <VOCNOISE> i think i <EXT-was> maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village <IVER>
and we stayed there for a while and then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she met my step <EXT-dad> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i was about <VOCNOISE> like six years old i think and then they moved up <VOCNOISE> uh to clintonville <SIL> about when i was about eight <SIL> now my dad lives up in clintonville too <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spent the weekends with my dad and i spent the week with them <IVER>
so and it was <SIL> it was neat though because pete was my mom was twenty nine and pete was eighteen <VOCNOISE> and so pete was just <LAUGH-like_some_kid> who liked to play yknow we'd go <HES-and> fly kites <HES-and> and do all this fun stuff and <VOCNOISE> 
<SIL> and the thing that was always cool about my mom is <CUTOFF-tha=tha> <CUTOFF-uh=I> it was somebody that <SIL> wasn't real nice to <EXT-me> or that i didn't really like <SIL> she wouldn't have anything to do with them i mean the whole thing was yknow if i approve of this person <IVER>
then then that was always her main focus <IVER>
so that was real nice and i was her maid of honor when they got <LAUGH-married_it_was_just_it_was_well_of_course_about_this_big_but> <IVER>
but she always she always put me first and i think that that made it <VOCNOISE> a lot more positive for me <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> i would say <SIL> so <SIL> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> well i had to drive her down here last time so i didn't want to come back <LAUGH-I_didn't_want_to_come_back> if she has to come back i might as well go with her <VOCNOISE> i'm just kidding we went to get something to eat i dropped her off <SIL> and she took the bus home <SIL> <EXT-hum> we're talking about <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think that <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i don't think that divorce is a bad thing <VOCNOISE> i think that <SIL> <CUTOFF-it=it's> <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you're married <VOCNOISE> and <EXT-you> <SIL> realize that you get to a point where you and this other person <VOCNOISE> <EXT-are> are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family <VOCNOISE> that it's better to just say <VOCNOISE> look this is not <LAUGH-working> <VOCNOISE> we both deserve to be happy and we <CUTOFF-de=deserve> <HES-and> <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> go your own <LAUGH-separate> ways <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think that <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <SIL> i think for me personally <SIL> i would certainly <SIL> i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i wouldn't <VOCNOISE> end up getting divorced <VOCNOISE> just because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as like coordinating <LAUGH-things> and i know that sounds kinda petty <VOCNOISE> but just <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <HES-but> <SIL> <HES-I> <SIL> <HES-I> <HES-I> <SIL> i mean i don't think it's i don't think it's bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously <VOCNOISE> to continue to <HES-make> a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different <IVER>
yknow there's things about <HES-the> <VOCNOISE> my dad that <VOCNOISE> and i wouldn't want to live with <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> uh he's great and he's wonderful to me i mean <VOCNOISE> my dad is really wonderful to me <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean things like <VOCNOISE> like when my mom had me <HES-he> he didn't pick her up from the hospital <SIL> i mean it's that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> like i said he's great to me and and everything <VOCNOISE> but i wouldn't <SIL> i wouldn't want to be married to him <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow_I_certainly> wouldn't and would i expect my mom to stay with <SIL> with that in that kind of a situation <VOCNOISE> no way i would want her to be happy <VOCNOISE> and i would want my dad to be happy also <VOCNOISE> so ultimately for that situation <HES-I> think it was much better <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> they got married kind of young too yknow and i think that <VOCNOISE> i think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be <CUTOFF-m=more> a little bit more careful <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i know that <VOCNOISE> that now it's a lot different than it used to be <VOCNOISE> people would get married and <HES-uh> they'd just be expected to stay together and there's a lot of people that have been married <VOCNOISE> for a really long time and they're miserable <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yknow <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> what's the point of staying married and being miserable i think it's better to get a divorce than <IVER>
than to do that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
see <IVER>
i don't agree with that at all <VOCNOISE> i think if your parents are unhappy together <SIL> only thing that's gonna happen is it's gonna trickle down and you're gonna have to listen to them being miserable <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> and i think it's much more positive to have two families <VOCNOISE> that are happy than one family that's miserable and they fight and then you feel like it's your yknow people say it's a my fault because this happened <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger <VOCNOISE> then <HES-I> <SIL> i can't imagine being a teenager <SIL> and having my parents split up i think that that would be <SIL> probably very difficult <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> so i don't <CUTOFF-ne=know> that's a totally different perspective <HES-just> to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger <IVER>
<LAUGH-no_that's> not what i mean <VOCNOISE> no i <HES-don't> i don't mean it that way but i just mean <VOCNOISE> i think <ERROR-it=it's> i think it's better that if people are <CUTOFF-g=getting> <HES-are> get to a point where they can't work it out i mean i think that <VOCNOISE> that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and <VOCNOISE> and maybe there is some way to work it out <IVER>
but i mean if you get to the point <HES-where> you where there isn't then you just have to <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think you have to be in the situation in my situation i think for my parents <VOCNOISE> it's better that they split up because they're both very happy now <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum but i don't know if that's <VOCNOISE> i think that the divorce rate has gone up because it's more socially acceptable i'm sure there's plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have <LAUGH-gotten_a_divorce> <VOCNOISE> had that been an option <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <HES-I> i think it just <HES-I> think a lot of it is just depends on the way you handle it <SIL> yknow how you <VOCNOISE> how you handle it after after the <HES-the> divorce is final i mean not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> do you see <CUTOFF-wha=what> does that make any sense at all <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i mean <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> it is <HES-it's> <HES-it's> <HES-it's> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> it's a touch <SIL> i think it's <HES-I> think it's tough and i think it's really an individual basis <SIL> but i wouldn't <SIL> i would say that there's a lot of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> other things that are <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-th=that> that would contribute more to <HES-any> <HES-societal> problems than divorce i really don't think that that would be the main <IVER>
because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think the fact that things like <CUTOFF-ih=?> responsibility maybe a long time ago <VOCNOISE> people stayed <VOCNOISE> married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of <HES-of> <VOCNOISE> their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take <LAUGH-care> of your family <VOCNOISE> instead of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh yknow <CUTOFF-m=?> <SIL> things as far as people getting pregnant and <HES-and> then this person goes off <HES-and> and leaves and you've got a lot of unmarried <VOCNOISE> single women that are all by themselves and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> it's just it's more socially acceptable to <SIL> to be able to do these things now then i think it was a long time ago i mean <VOCNOISE> peoples' families wouldn't would never stand for something like that they'd say look you need to take care of this you need to deal with this and now it's just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's kind of normal and everybody just kinda goes along with it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
see <CUTOFF-i=it?> well if it doesn't if it doesn't work than i can <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well that's what my best friend amy said i'll get married and hell if it doesn't work i'll just get divorced <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-that's_a_great_attitude_to_have_Amy> <VOCNOISE> but i mean <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah_really> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i mean <HES-I> guess for me <HES-I> <SIL> i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just think jason and i get along so well <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow and <CUTOFF-w=we've> and we've been together for about two years and <VOCNOISE> i <HES-mean> <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i just <HES-I> do i just <HES-I> just really like him i don't <LAUGH-know_if_I'll_feel_that_way_in> <VOCNOISE> in ten years from now but it certainly <VOCNOISE> there's a lot of things <HES-that> that our families are very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> about different things <EXT-and> <HES-and> we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things you have to look at <VOCNOISE> from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> his name was jason too but <CUTOFF-h=he> <VOCNOISE> <HES-he> <VOCNOISE> he drank a lot <SIL> <IVER>
great guy <VOCNOISE> but he sure liked to get drunk <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> and the problem was he would turn into such a jerk <IVER>
yknow and i just <CUTOFF-though-thought> <HES-it?> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just don't <SIL> i just don't like this is not so is this something <HES-that> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i look long term is this something that i wanna deal with for the rest of my life and i said no it just isn't <VOCNOISE> yknow and i think that you have to look <CUTOFF-a=at> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and see if you're compatible with somebody <SIL> <HES-before> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow people get into situations and they marry people that you <HES-just> you've <SIL> from the outside you can look and you can think <VOCNOISE> are you nuts <SIL> yknow that is never gonna <LAUGH-work_yknow> so i think that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you just kinda hafta take into consideration yknow are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that's gonna <CUTOFF-be=be?> that's gonna work and be positive <SIL> yeah i don't <SIL> i don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm not old <LAUGH-enough_to_know_anything_yet> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a lot bigger <SIL> <IVER>
um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the things that i notice that are different <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i guess <CUTOFF-a=and> i mean <HES-if> you look like <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=as> as far as expansion obviously there's a lot of areas that that are developed now that didn't used to be <IVER>
<EXT-um> <SIL> <HES-I> <HES-I> certainly spent most of my time <HES-well> <SIL> in the areas that i grew up i mean i don't <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't really go over to the east side very <CUTOFF-o=often> very often yknow sometimes we'd go over yknow in highschool and drive and see if we could see a prostitute <SIL> yknow or something like that <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i <HES-don't> <SIL> i don't know <CUTOFF-wha=what> <SIL> as far as <VOCNOISE> i don't really keep up with statistics as far as the crime rate and those types of things i mean i don't know <VOCNOISE> if it's the media <LAUGH=uh_that's> <UNKNOWN> yknow <CUTOFF-kin=kinda> <SIL> portrays as there's more than there used to be <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i know that when i was younger i was allowed to <CUTOFF-d=do> to do a lot more things <VOCNOISE> uh by myself like to to go places on the bus <HES-and> and those types of things and <VOCNOISE> than my family's allowed to do now <IVER>
so i don't know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous <VOCNOISE> um but i think that comes with the <CUTOFF-b=bigger> with a bigger city when you get more people there's obviously gonna be <CUTOFF-wi=?> some more problems <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and uh i mean that's <HES-really> that's really all that i know so it's obviously a lot more build up it's gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 
<IVER>
and a lot more um <VOCNOISE> different suburbs so maybe it's <VOCNOISE> it's going and <HES-and> becoming a little wealthier <IVER>
and <IVER>
i don't think it's <CUTOFF-really=really> i don't think it's really affected me <CUTOFF-tha=that> i mean obviously there's more places to go shopping or to <EXT-eat> or you there's more traffic <LAUGH-laugh_I> don't particularly care much for <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> but <HES-it> <HES-I> don't think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other <VOCNOISE> <HES-it> <HES-and> it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood <VOCNOISE> <EXT-it's> it was where <HES-you> you went to school with the people once at least once i went to highschool i went to public school <IVER>
um <SIL> and you kinda knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that's still <VOCNOISE> that's still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> so i don't <CUTOFF-thing=think> <HES-I> me personally other than <VOCNOISE> other than the fact that maybe there's a couple more things to do there's bigger more comfortable movie theaters and <VOCNOISE> and that kinda stuff <HES-it> hasn't really <IVER>
affected me and i can't say that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that maybe if <HES-it> if it would have stayed small <EXT-maybe> <VOCNOISE> maybe <HES-I> could notice some kind of a difference <LAUGH-that_way_but> <VOCNOISE> but <HES-I> i never <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> i haven't noticed anything <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i can see that i yknow uh like i said for me i kind of <HES-a> <VOCNOISE> i kinda stay where i am so it's not that i really travel <HES-out> into some of those other areas <SIL> more <VOCNOISE> so i mean <CUTOFF-w=well?> it doesn't really affect me personally <SIL> maybe that's <EXT-bad> <LAUGH-I_don't_know_maybe_should_I> <CUTOFF-j=just> feel guilty <LAUGH-about_that> but <IVER>
but <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> i think there's uh you they're so many small communities like even <HES-O> o s u is really a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> obviously its own its own little community and then you've got <VOCNOISE> yknow dublin and they've got their own parades and their own different things so i agree i mean i think that <VOCNOISE> that you there really is a lot of things to do in our own individual area that <VOCNOISE> i can't see somebody from dublin going over to <VOCNOISE> the west side <HES-to> to do <LAUGH-anything> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yknow what <HES-I> i don't <VOCNOISE> and uh maybe also <HES-I> i feel safer <VOCNOISE> where i live too and and that's something that's an issue for me i know when i <VOCNOISE> do travel down cleveland avenue it makes me it does it makes me nervous <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i just kinda stay away from that <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH=I_don't_know> <SIL> i don't wanna get shot <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well it's <HES-kinda> it's kinda hard when you've got <LAUGH-your> <VOCNOISE> your <CUTOFF-v=?> limited choices here yknow some of it some of the issues i thought were kind of <VOCNOISE> important but when you're looking at the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mayorial candidates <SIL> did you watch that debate <IVER>
oh was <LAUGH-horrible_it_was_a_horrible> <VOCNOISE> because you watch it and you think <HES-uh> oh my god <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i don't want either of these people <IVER>
i mean <CUTOFF-Dod=Dorothy> dorothy peters obviously been around for a really long time and i uh <VOCNOISE> i would tip i'm <VOCNOISE> my views are typically a little bit more democratic but i'm not too say that i certainly wouldn't vote <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> for the person that i thought would do the best job <IVER>
but when you look at coleman he <SIL> <CUTOFF-thi=thinks> <SIL> thinks <VOCNOISE> there was <CUTOFF-a=a> <SIL> point where they <CUTOFF-sai=said?> they asked a yes or no question <IVER>
and neither one of these folks <SIL> could <HES-answer> it yes <SIL> or no and they're going <VOCNOISE> just answer yes or no they'll tell you <VOCNOISE> well i think i stated my point very clearly when i was <VOCNOISE> no the answer is yes or is it was <VOCNOISE> it was um <VOCNOISE> healthcare <EXT-for> <VOCNOISE> living partners <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> it's a simple question <VOCNOISE> yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it just <VOCNOISE> drives me nuts that <VOCNOISE> yknow and i know that that from a p r stand point you don't wanna <VOCNOISE> you don't wanna shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like the <VOCNOISE> damn it <SIL> yknow if you're running for office <SIL> you should just <SIL> just be up front <IVER>
just say how you feel <IVER>
yknow because i just think it looks so awful when you can't you can't even admit to what <HES-you> what you're opinion is <IVER>
yknow and <HES-and> it's just <VOCNOISE> i think that that happens so often there are too many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when you're talking circles around yourself <VOCNOISE> but you never say anything <IVER>
so that's <SIL> that's frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think <SIL> i don't want either one of these people there should be a none of the above <VOCNOISE> yknow if there was <HES-uh> that option i'm sure a lot <CUTOFF-mo=more> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
really yknow i agree i mean none of the above you go and i think a lot more people would certainly go out <VOCNOISE> they would vote for none of the above and they we can have some more candidates <IVER>
i think that would be perfect <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think it would <IVER>
well i think it's true <HES-you> <HES-you> don't vote because you think i don't want either one of these people what does it matter <IVER>
<HES-he> who cares so yknow people just think <VOCNOISE> there's no really no point to even vote <VOCNOISE> <HES-since> it's too bad <VOCNOISE> really is <IVER>
hum <VOCNOISE> transportation issue <VOCNOISE> that was kind of a <VOCNOISE> i thought that rail system looked kinda cool yknow which is <VOCNOISE> which is kinda tough the question is do we wanna spend the money on it <VOCNOISE> and will people actually use it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think a lot of it goes back down to traffic and you're like yknow people driving both ways <VOCNOISE> and i think if people are <CUTOFF-actu=actually> if they're gonna make it so people are actually gonna <EXT-use> it <SIL> i think i probably a <CUTOFF-b=pretty> <SIL> pretty good thing to have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <HES-I> i voted for <LAUGH> <LAUGH=which_I_know_Jason_said> <VOCNOISE> i can't believe you're gonna do that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> and i <VOCNOISE> i just i guess i just felt like <SIL> i don't know it's it's kinda <HES-I> <CUTOFF-mea=mean> <LAUGH> <SIL> i don't i just think that that's kinda neat and if you're looking at traffic and <VOCNOISE> and i could see if i was going downtown and coming back <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the amount of money that you pay to park downtown is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> outrageous <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> even <CUTOFF-ju=just> just having <HES-to> takes <SIL> i know when it's when it was snowing because i worked on <HES-I> worked on front street <VOCNOISE> and where i would come <CUTOFF-fro=from> i live on bethel road which is <VOCNOISE> i'd take bethel to three fifteen <VOCNOISE> down <SIL> through downtown and it would take me an hour and forty five minutes <SIL> in the snow <VOCNOISE> to get down there and if i could <VOCNOISE> if i could jump on this rail system and it would take me fifteen minutes and i wouldn't have to pay fifty dollars a month for parking <VOCNOISE> <HES-why> why not do that <VOCNOISE> and all there's also the whole pollution thing and <VOCNOISE> and those types of things so i thought that was <IVER>
really <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
really and people use do people use them <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hum <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
wow <SIL> that's great <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that's great <IVER>
to do that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah and i think there's a whole bunch of people that just don't wanna spend any extra money on anything <VOCNOISE> we're already paying for enough things you don't wanna do this <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-I_don't_know_how_that's_even_possible> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
but i don't understand is this <HES-can> with the construction they start <SIL> everywhere yknow you think that you would start one area you put a whole bunch of people and they'd work real fast and they'd get that done <VOCNOISE> and then they'd move on <VOCNOISE> but it's like <VOCNOISE> every single <LAUGH-place_in_the> city's got like four guys working <HES-and> you think what the hell you doing over there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> then the people that are doing you think why do you why are we hiring these guys yknow what are they what are they <LAUGH-thinking> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well they have <IVER>
yeah it's projected like six years to take <CUTOFF-p=place?> to finish some of these projects <VOCNOISE> own <SIL> real <VOCNOISE> well i know we drove through georgia <SIL> you actually see people working on the road there's a whole bunch of people and they're all out there working <VOCNOISE> yknow and you get to ohio there's that <VOCNOISE> i don't know something on david <EXT-David> letterman had a picture of this and i think i've seen it before that big sign that says <VOCNOISE> your tax dollars at <EXT-work> yknow and there's the construction guy smoking a cigarette leaning up against the sign <VOCNOISE> kinda thing <LAUGH> <LAUGH-like_great> <LAUGH> it was a kinda funny <IVER>
well i mean <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no i <HES-think> <HES-I> i just think that typically you see a lot of <CUTOFF-peop=people> lot of places that are that are under construction not very many people working there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN-what's_a_barrels> <VOCNOISE> 
<SIL> <IVER>
uh <SIL> <NOISE> which <SIL> which the the as far as the the <CUTOFF-v=violence> <IVER>
violence <IVER>
there well there's the whole thing about the police chief <VOCNOISE> and then there's the whole thing about <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> about the <CUTOFF-laws=lawsuit> the federal lawsuit against columbus <IVER>
well just chief <CUTOFF-ja=jackson> of the thing about chief jackson <SIL> i don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <HES-uh> he's <HES-not> i he's <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i'm not real up on this i know that um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <HES-he> he's done some things and <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i don't know <HES-I> i <CUTOFF-kn=know> <VOCNOISE> i don't know if it was drugs or <LAUGH-some-I-know> something ridiculous <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> that a lot of people and i think a lot of the <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-p=police> the police force and a lot of other officials are <VOCNOISE> are pretty much in agreement that he should resign <SIL> and he feels like <SIL> like he's just not going to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that we don't have any um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-w=we?> that the mayor can't <VOCNOISE> nobody can actually make him resign that that's something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as <VOCNOISE> yknow dorothy was teater was saying i'm gonna make him do this which is something that she doesn't have any power to do <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <HES-that> <HES-and> and about how <VOCNOISE> how they just continue to get raises and they're and they're not doing very much about it and <VOCNOISE> and less than fifty percent of the police force is actually in police cars and <VOCNOISE> and a lot people <HES-are> are doing desk jobs and those types of things and <HES-I> i guess a lot of people just aren't very happy with the job he's been doing <IVER>
and he just says yknow i <HES-don't> i <CUTOFF-do=don't> whether you like me or not i don't care <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna keep working <VOCNOISE> i don't know but i think it was something it was something real shady that he that he got into and i knew that <VOCNOISE> i don't know if it was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think it was <SIL> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> cocaine or <CUTOFF-some=something> i don't something <CUTOFF-wa=?> i don't <SIL> i don't know i mean something that was pretty shady <IVER>
yeah and i don't know if it's quite that <LAUGH-bad_but> <LAUGH> but it was certainly some things that he's been doing that aren't aren't approved of <SIL> and i'm not real up on that <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
isn't that <EXT-unbelievable> it's <IVER>
<EXT-amazing> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's almost worse though that it's not even a surprise <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
oh my god <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum give us a job sure <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
is wrong with him <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yknow i think a lot of times uh you yknow people aren't real rational as far as as who they <SIL> they go for <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i can certainly i can certainly see that <SIL> and that <CUTOFF-mih=me> <VOCNOISE> i think that yknow lot of <CUTOFF-th=the> a lot of people feel like too oh he's he's he's one us yknow he's like he's like we are kind of thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well michigan it's a ten year mandatory jail time sentence if you get caught with any cocaine at all <SIL> <IVER>
ten years no question about it that's it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're in jail for ten years eighteen years old <VOCNOISE> if you've got anything on ten years <NOISE> that's it <VOCNOISE> yknow and you look at some of these other people or like these sports people and <IVER>
<SIL> they get caught with that stuff or have <CUTOFF-ih=it> <SIL> and nothing happens and it just sets such a horrible example <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that here you've got you know some regular some <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> eighteen year old kid that does something really stupid <NOISE> and he's ten years in jail <VOCNOISE> and then you've got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can be elected well yknow and you just <SIL> it's just <SIL> it's so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's so wrong <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah well <IVER>
i don't even know what to <CUTOFF-sih=say> what a disgrace <LAUGH> <LAUGH-it's_just> embarrassing it really <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i did <SIL> i did <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean i think he's done some positive things that whole thing about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-eh=as> <CUTOFF-eh=as> as far as like your student loans and being able to get <LAUGH-into_s=into_school> <LAUGH> which has helped me yknow <VOCNOISE> and i <CUTOFF-thi=think> yknow all this that <CUTOFF-ae=as> as far as some of the issues go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um some of his foreign policy things i think have gone pretty decently but i mean i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't i don't know i mean it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> i don't know if if it really if you really <SIL> it <SIL> i feel like that they're that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with really <VOCNOISE> yknow and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they don't ever really put anything into action they just kind of skate along <SIL> yknow and i don't know if there's anything substantial i can say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that was a wonderful thing that you did that i feel very affected by it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> economy's fine <SIL> i mean so <CUTOFF-ah=it's> it's not that he's <VOCNOISE> not that he's doing a horrible job but i don't really know how much he's actually doing <VOCNOISE> yknow and i think that unfortunately spend a lot of your time trying to get out of <VOCNOISE> out of personal <SIL> issues that you've gotten yourself into and you can't really focus on anything that's that's positive that you wanna do for <VOCNOISE> for the country and i think <SIL> i think it's just too bad because i feel like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if i was president uh not that i wanna be president but <VOCNOISE> yknow you'd have three or four things that you'd think were very important you'd you'd <VOCNOISE> hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very competent that you'd feel like they'd actually be able to accomplish some things <VOCNOISE> and you'd really work to get some stuff done yknow and i don't know if it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if it's just because <VOCNOISE> yknow you have to <VOCNOISE> get agreement from all the other all the <SIL> everybody else in government before you can pass anything or or why <VOCNOISE> yknow why don't these things get taken care of i mean there's so many different issues that people wanna look at and <UNKNOWN> end up focusing on things like philip morris yknow <VOCNOISE> which is like the biggest thing in the whole world yknow and and there's so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that are important <VOCNOISE> i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know maybe i mean i don't <SIL> i don't i'm not real up on everything that's been done but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused and you and you would be able to say <VOCNOISE> yknow this is what there's these three things that i think are really important that i'm really gonna work to make sure that they get taking care of and <VOCNOISE> and i don't <SIL> i just think people kind of la-dee-da it and say well this is <VOCNOISE> it's like this yknow well we'll see what we can kind of do about it and then we'll <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i mean but i mean <VOCNOISE> we're not at a depression and <VOCNOISE> and the yknow the employment rate is fine and <VOCNOISE> healthcare is we've got some improvements there and like i said that <VOCNOISE> that student loan <LAUGH> <UNKNOWN-this_is_big_notes> yknow uh but i just <VOCNOISE> i mean so i wouldn't say he's done a a a horrible horrible job <VOCNOISE> but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we've wasted <VOCNOISE> but we could have spent that <CUTOFF-t=time> <VOCNOISE> money on something else yknow and you end up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> doing that <IVER>
yeah i usually don't <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> not quite there <LAUGH-yet> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not really <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<IVER>
i <SIL> i don't i don't <LAUGH> <IVER>
really <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i haven't i i really haven't even haven't even given it that much thought yet <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> once they start running those <LAUGH-campaigns> <LAUGH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> then i'll kind of kind of read up on it but i haven't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> not really <SIL> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
that's fine <IVER>

<SIL> um <SIL> to move forward in my life now what happened with the chill was yknow there was <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i had a friend that worked for them so they didn't know that and um <SIL> uh he told me that there was glass in the back <SIL> room that they were supposed to install were supposed to have installed that was five feet higher <SIL> three to five feet higher <SIL> and um <SIL> should have would have could have yknow if it was up i wouldn't have got hit <SIL> i mean there's no two ways about it <SIL> but <SIL> if i didn't get hit i wouldn't be where i am <VOCNOISE> now <SIL> spiritually so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't refute it as an accident <SIL> and most of the spiritual leaders and people i talked to <SIL> ah went through the catholic church because that was where i was raised and what i was raised and none of those people could provide me with any adequate things <SIL> terms of counseling i know they tried <SIL> i know they did the best that they could <SIL> but um <SIL> there's a lot of things that the catholic church won't like to admit that they're wrong on <SIL> and they are wrong <SIL> um <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they'll sit there and ask me to atone for my sins yet they won't atone for the sins of all the priests that are molesting children still to this day <SIL> and they protect them <SIL> and that's not right <SIL> and i'm very <SIL> very <SIL> uh <SIL> outspoken about that <SIL> so rather than banging my head on the wall to people who wouldn't listen i just decided to leave the church <SIL> i don't go there anymore the only time i've gone there was for <SIL> my nephew's baptism and my grandparents' funeral <SIL> and that's the only time you'll find me in there <SIL> yknow <SIL> i went to a wedding <SIL> too but it's difficult sitting in there <SIL> because of the way i follow now and uh <SIL> and actually seeing things for what they are <SIL> and it's frustrating not being able to explain that to people but that's okay <SIL> um <SIL> with the lawsuit ah we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they <SIL> had all that higher <SIL> taller glass back there over a year <SIL> so they tried to use the excuse their excuse was that they couldn't find the hardware <SIL> to install it <SIL> and uh given all the hardware stores that we have here and <SIL> the ability to over night freight things uh <SIL> if it was any kind of ah <SIL> special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country <SIL> there's no excuse <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so basically <SIL> yknow it came down to after <SIL> it came to a legal battle <SIL> which was ah i was not gonna back down <SIL> they were um <SIL> i was poor monetarily and they knew that <SIL> so they were using the legal system to wear me down <SIL> um <SIL> the first uh at the date of filing i mean <SIL> first of all it took <SIL> i had a statute of limitations was two years <SIL> uh i had an attorney in a law firm representing but they were dragging their feet <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill <SIL> yknow <SIL> and that they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet <SIL> even though i knew the guy so i just said well look i'm dissatisfied i'm gonna go find another attorney <SIL> so give me my file <SIL> see you <SIL> and i went shopping around for a new attorney <SIL> and it took me about <SIL> seven <SIL> before <VOCNOISE-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> pardon me <SIL> seven attorneys before i found one that was <SIL> adequate in terms of <SIL> knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a neurosurgeon and uh <SIL> he had experience and expertise in uh <SIL> bringing up <VOCNOISE> the uh <SIL> the differences uh <SIL> and the realities of of a brain injury <SIL> ah and the effects the lifelong effects yknow <SIL> so after <SIL> the two years we got in uh <SIL> just under the two years <SIL> so i mean <SIL> hell that would be what it happened in ninety three so <SIL> just under <SIL> december ninety five <SIL> uh <SIL> the day the last day <SIL> of ah <SIL> the statute running out we filed <SIL> so we got it filed <SIL> once it was filed the judge ah scheduled a hearing <SIL> and for whatever stupid reason <SIL> um <SIL> the soonest they could hear the case was one year from the date that we filed <SIL> so <SIL> you can see when you get <EXT-into> bed with yknow <SIL> and involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multimillion dollar lawsuit <SIL> or whatever <SIL> yknow any kind of lawsuit uh <SIL> the big boys get all the breaks <SIL> so <SIL> ah in my opinion the judge didn't wanna hear the case before then or maybe his docket was full but i'm saying <SIL> yknow there's no prioritization in the legal system <SIL> there are some things that uh should be addressed <SIL> soon <SIL> uh i shouldn't have to wait that long but <SIL> so then <SIL> came down to one week prior to the uh <SIL> hearing <SIL> and i got a letter from my attorney and he said that uh and also a phone call from the office saying that uh <SIL> um <SIL> that they uh <SIL> were filing a continuance <SIL> <VOCNOISE> which meant that uh <SIL> the judge granted them an additional year <SIL> of discovery <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> whatever the law says <SIL> yknow <SIL> the judge says he has to back it up <SIL> but <SIL> so that postponed the trial for another year <SIL> which pissed me off <SIL> yknow <SIL> but that's exactly what they were planning on <SIL> yknow <SIL> wearing me <VOCNOISE-down> like i said <SIL> knowing that i don't have the money to <SIL> throw in there and say hey <SIL> yknow <SIL> um <SIL> but <EXT-they> know full well that we had all the evidence that we had too <SIL> so <SIL> ah <SIL> that just postponed it for another year finally we got into uh <SIL> coming in and then they ah sent a letter saying they wanted to <SIL> meet <SIL> uh for arbitration <SIL> to see if they <SIL> we could hammer out some kind of settlement <SIL> couple months before the trial <SIL> uh i was unaware of this common practice but yknow <SIL> it was very <SIL> iffy situation <SIL> um juries here <SIL> uh in columbus have been mm <SIL> ultra conservative <SIL> uh they feel that people for some reason or another <SIL> that people that have been legitimately injured and their lives have been affected that they don't deserve money <SIL> for whatever reason <SIL> um <SIL> and it <UNKNOWN-and_I> don't think it's fair <SIL> that they can sit back and be that conservative if it hasn't happened to them <SIL> i don't think that's fair <SIL> um <SIL> because it does affect your entire <CUTOFF-lay=life> <SIL> has <SIL> otherwise i'd be full time employed <SIL> i'd be gainfully employed making money and i'm not <SIL> and that's <SIL> that's not because of anything <SIL> uh <SIL> it's by choices on my part but it's <SIL> it's uh <SIL> you know there's a lot that <SIL> there's a lot there <SIL> the betrayal that i've had to struggle with there's a lot there that <SIL> um <SIL> yknow i felt i've been betrayed <SIL> by everybody that taught me <SIL> i feel betrayed by the the government <SIL> by the legal system <SIL> by the politicians by all the people that have been put in charge <SIL> to protect people <SIL> to protect ideals <SIL> to protect principles <VOCNOISE> throw it out the window for money <SIL> and then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt <SIL> um <SIL> it got down to just <SIL> ah dollars and cents <SIL> bartering <SIL> for what my life was worth <SIL> and it's <SIL> the bidding started at a hundred twenty five thousand dollars <SIL> i feel i'm worth more than that <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i feel like you can't put a value on a human life <SIL> um <SIL> yknow there were just subtle things that yknow my <SIL> sense of <ERROR-s=smell?> <SIL> taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half <SIL> ah <SIL> just all the trauma that goes involved with it not just <SIL> not just the physical trauma i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength <SIL> uh i wasn't killed <SIL> yknow <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so the physical <SIL> burden i was still dealing with a lot of the physical pain <SIL> uh it's gotten significantly less <SIL> but <SIL> uh the emotional pain <SIL> was worse <SIL> and is worse <SIL> um having to <SIL> have a <SIL> yknow a lack of money now <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> means lack of socializing means lack of going and doing things <SIL> um <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> don't have any <SIL> <VOCNOISE> lot of relationships don't have <SIL> a girlfriend don't have a wife don't nothing like that i've got a dog <SIL> a golden retriever <SIL> 
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> he was being real helpful <SIL> yknow <SIL> with the <SIL> uh being a support <VOCNOISE> yknow my parents are very supportive but <SIL> yknow it was just sickening that I when I sat down there and they <SIL> just you know the bidding started at a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and <SIL> actually they offered us twelve thousand dollars my <SIL> attorney looked at him and said are you fucking nuts <SIL> he said this guy had his head split open and <SIL> it was your negligence <SIL> so <SIL> you know <SIL> we'll we'll take that as an insult <IVER>
<SIL> and don't insult us any more or we'll go to trial <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so my attorney jumped it back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollar <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I couldn't take sitting there <SIL> these guys going back and forth and what they thought I was worth <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> even the arbitrator was an asshole <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> but uh <SIL> that's the way that system works <IVER>
that's all they understand is money <IVER>
the lawyers the judges everybody <SIL> that works in that system <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I don't care who they are there isn't an honest one in it <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> I don't care <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there isn't an honest one in it they might think they are <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but once you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> expose yourself to corruption <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you take that in with you <IVER>
and sooner or later <SIL> yknow all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service <VOCNOISE> I guarantee you they went in it with <VOCNOISE> the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> once they get in there <SIL> it's such a bureaucracy <IVER>
it's so corrupt <SIL> they have two choices <VOCNOISE> to stay in it and try <VOCNOISE> or to succumb to all the things <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ninety percent of them as you can see what happens in washington <SIL> <VOCNOISE> have succumbed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> there's a <VOCNOISE> I don't I don't hear any of them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> raising hell about what really matters in this country <SIL> <IVER>
yknow they all get uh side lined and side tracked by special private interests and that's <SIL> that's the bottom line <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and it's sad but there's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <CUTOFF-I=I> I choose not to involve myself in that <SIL> as <VOCNOISE> <SIL> much as possible we ended up settling for <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yknow bout seventy thousand dollars and uh <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it was just a hard decision to make yknow because I felt yknow <SIL> a lot more shoulda come from that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I mean in <CUTOFF-or=order> <VOCNOISE> joking around yknow I saw that Adam Sandler movie Big Daddy he <SIL> got his foot run over by a cab and there was a line in there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> pardon me where he says uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well I got my foot run over by a cab and that cab was huge and the jury decided that one night of pain in the hospital was worth two hundred thousand dollars <IVER>
<IVER>
and I'm like yknow what hospital was that yknow where <SIL> <CUTOFF-wh=what> <EXT-what> what <EXT-jury> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> so a lot of the things you hear in movies and television about these multi million dollar lawsuits <HES-are> <SIL> <HES-is> is a lie <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> even the lady that <SIL> I mean <VOCNOISE> sued <CUTOFF-f=for> <SIL> mcdonald's for <VOCNOISE> <SIL> spilling the coffee on herself because she put <EXT-her> in her crotch with the lid off yknow uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh there ought to be a common sense clause in law suits yknow <CUTOFF-i=it> her own stupidity <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and <EXT-then> you get the attorneys trying to argue that well mcdonalds <SIL> coffee is hotter than every other <SIL> coffee <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it's like <VOCNOISE> big deal <SIL> yknow common sense it's hot you don't put it in a sensitive area while you're driving to work <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but she sued for ten million and the papers said she won ten million <SIL> she didn't <SIL> <SIL> I mean after that ten million award was given by a jury <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then the uh mcdonald's is allowed a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> an appeal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at the end of a year so she doesn't see any money for a year <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and that's if they don't appeal <SIL> but ninety percent of these big corporations have the money behind them they have the lawyers behind them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so they can sue for an appeal <IVER>
uh poor people can't do that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-so> after all is said and done with her case she was left with about a million dollars <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then out of that million the attorney in the firm got a third <SIL> plus she had to pay off his expenses so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> really she was probably left with only about three hundred thousand dollars <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which if used wisely okay maybe she could've <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but it sounded to me like she didn't have a money problem anyway <SIL> she was a corporate person <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um but a very stupid person <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so I mean that's basically my my <SIL> battle with the legal system I <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow I've <CUTOFF-g=got> I've got a person right now that owes me five hundred dollars that I wanted to take to small claims court <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I even got the <ERROR-ca=cancelled> uh the cancelled check to prove it and <EXT-everything> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow uh <SIL> and when I look at what the alternative is which is subjecting myself to <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> unfairness <SIL> uh <SIL> even though I feel I got a concrete no way <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> uh those are the ones that I mean I'd have to pay an attorney and the cheapest one I can find right now is a hundred forty five dollars an hour <IVER>
and <CUTOFF-n=nobody> nobody's worth that <SIL> you know <SIL> so that's what I'm saying it's so retarded <SIL> uh over <CUTOFF-th=the> I don't mean to <SIL> use that word in a bad way but it's ridiculous <UNKNOWN-so_just_but_it_that_I_mean_uh> that's better word <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh that <SIL> that people have to uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can't afford the legal help <SIL> so I think that's wrong <SIL> in this country <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the land of the free and the home of the brave yeah right yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's land of the free all right yeah it's free country but it'll cost you <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> I don't know <SIL> uh <SIL> this freedom <SIL> semi quasi freedom <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's an illusion of freedom and a reality of freedom <NOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and the indian people know the big difference of that <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
so <SIL> but <EXT-that's> yknow <SIL> I ended up settling the attorney got most the money <VOCNOISE> what little I had I invested <EXT-some> and then I made some bad investments when I went off <SIL> my medication <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> blew it <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow so that was my responsibility my fault but uh <SIL> yknow how it was just <EXT-the> years of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> pent up frustration and I just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I spent it <SIL> I spent it in a <SIL> yknow unorthodox way but <SIL> yknow well I had fun doing it <IVER>
uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> won't lie there <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> lot of happy strippers in town <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or I should say exotic dancers <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> well something that <HES-I> I I wanted to get into some kind of counseling <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> with people that had been through traumatic experiences <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but I need to be at a point where <SIL> yknow <SIL> I'm <SIL> in my recovery <SIL> where I know <SIL> I won't be sucked back down into their <SIL> <VOCNOISE> way of thinking <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so it's it's a step by step process I <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I tried to go into counseling for chemical addictions yknow for alcohol and drugs <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> um the bullshit excuses I keep hearing from these addicts was just too much to take <SIL> and even <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> even the bullshit excuses from former addicts <IVER>
it was like uh give them a license to be a screw up <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh a lot of the nurses even who were former addicts yknow when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they weren't doing following protocol <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and of course me I'd be the one saying hey you're not following protocol <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they'd say well yknow I'm a I'm a former addict I'm allowed to do that <IVER>
I said <EXT-no> no you're not <IVER>
yknow <SIL> <IVER>
<EXT-yes> <SIL> yes and <CUTOFF-a=and> and that's so I'm <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I'm geared towards yknow with people with mental illness yknow they've they've diagnosed me with bipolar but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow my neurologist says the bipolar was a just a chemical imbalance as a result of <VOCNOISE> the brain <SIL> injury <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and spiritual leaders told me that uh it's a spiritual imbalance <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's there's <SIL> really no uh chemical thing there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's <CUTOFF-th=the> the problem is a <HES-both> physical mental and spiritual with the majority of the problem is spiritual <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when you talk to people that <SIL> uh know that <IVER>
not believe it they know it <IVER>
I mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you talk to people in the catholic church about the unseen <SIL> meaning the spiritual realm <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they freak out <IVER>
yet they pray a prayer every sunday we believe in the seen and the unseen <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I'll never forget it <SIL> because I recited it for god knows how many years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but when you talk to them about possession when you talk to them about demons or spirits <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they freak out <IVER>
or they use the bible to say well yknow god specifically says in this chapter not to partake in spiritual activity <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well who do you think wrote that <SIL> yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> who do you think wants to keep you from <SIL> from doing something that'll help you because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> people this land and <SIL> indigenous tribes all over the world they don't follow the bible <SIL> they've done pretty damn good <SIL> yknow and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
it's just the <CUTOFF-spirit=spiritual> <EXT-the> spiritual aspect there is the realm even einstein the most <VOCNOISEd> brilliant man supposedly mathematically of our time <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yet but nobody has taken the time or made the time <SIL> <VOCNOISE> to challenge his theory <IVER>
yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he says that e equals m c squared I say it's e equals m c cubed because <HES-the> the world is three dimensional <VOCNOISE> it's not two dimensional <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh two dimensional limits <SIL> everything but you look at his theory of relativity <SIL> <VOCNOISE> all of our mathematical theorems <VOCNOISE> physical theorems on physics and things of that nature <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> have been based off that <SIL> <IVER>
and they're not accurate <SIL> 
because i've <EXT-seen> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> things that are not <SIL> physically possible <IVER>
they're supposed to be not physically possible <SIL> <SIL> goes against the first law of physics <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i saw it happen <SIL> <IVER>
i experienced it <SIL> well <SIL> ah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and some of our ceremonies <EXT-yknow> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> this is confidential right <SIL> no one else is gonna see this <VOCNOISE> because i don't wanna <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i don't wanna have any of this printed or anything <VOCNOISE> yknow it uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
all right <IVER>
well in in the ambiguous part of it yknow just saying try to be <SIL> protective of <SIL> the ways <IVER>
of the people of this land that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's in a <CUTOFF-c=ceremony> a ceremony called an eneepee which is a sweat lodge <SIL> and a lot of people will talk about sweat lodge um <SIL> it involves heating up stones <SIL> in a fire <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <EXT-uh> <VOCNOISE> putting the stones <EXT-in> <EXT-the> <SIL> lodge <SIL> and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not a sauna <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <SIL> not a uh steam room <IVER>
uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a very spiritual <SIL> experience <SIL> yes it gets hot in there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> how hot <SIL> who knows <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> it's been such a strengthening <SIL> spiritually strengthening <SIL> thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it also <SIL> physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out of your body because of that heat <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> it gets all the crap out of you <IVER>
yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it clears you purifies you that's what it was for <SIL> that's what the people used it for purification <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and even <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's made up of four rounds usually sometimes three <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-uh> and the last round is usually called the purification round <SIL> where whoever's pouring the sweat the spiritual leader that's pouring the sweat <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he'll make it tough on you <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he'll pour all the water that's left in that bucket <SIL> and he'll do it in a way <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it just brings that heat out that steam that breath that sacred breath is what we call it <IVER>
god <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and breathing that <SIL> it's like when we were in the womb of her mother <SIL> we were breathing water <SIL> we were breathing <SIL> fluid <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> oxygen is in that fluid too <SIL> it's in that mist that goes over the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the fields <IVER>
god's in that <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> even when a cow takes a crap in the middle of the field and that steam comes off it in the winter time <SIL> <VOCNOISE> god's in that steam <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a lot of people can't understand that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-but> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <CUTOFF-the> the the laws of thermodynamics say that it's impossible for rocks to retain heat that way and that they can't be heated to an adequate point of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> of withholding heat <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> or sustaining heat <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when heated by a fire <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that <SIL> you would need <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> like in the old days yknow to melt metal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they used uh air <SIL> pumping it through <IVER>
<EXT-coals> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like the blacksmiths or whatever yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<EXT-to> melt and <SIL> soften the metal so they could work with it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> yes the air would help increase the temperature <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> a fire kept for a long period of time <SIL> will be hotter than any kind of fire you've ever touched <SIL> or been around <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that fire is sacred it's a sacred fire <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so that's why it's possible <SIL> but <SIL> if it <SIL> if i went down there with the laws of physics <VOCNOISE> told me that those rocks <SIL> couldn't sustain heat <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yet i see when the fire keeper breaks them out of the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> out of the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that they're red orange glowing <SIL> you gonna tell me they're not hot <SIL> so that's that's one example <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
<SIL> yes <IVER>
i've done it <SIL> for the last uh <SIL> bout five years <IVER>
uh <SIL> how many i don't know it doesn't matter <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> been in <EXT-in> <VOCNOISE> many ones that were <SIL> too hard for me <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and i had to get out <SIL> uh <SIL> and other ones <CUTOFF-i=it> it's a it's a struggle <SIL> with that thing and understanding it <SIL> takes time to understand it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lot of people lot of good people are helping me <SIL> to try and understand it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i was trying to let the fear of that <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> though i'm not afraid to die <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm afraid sometimes that i'll die before i get a chance to do <SIL> what i feel i was sent here to do <SIL> which is just the basic things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fall in love with somebody have children raise them <IVER>
and move on <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> that's that's basically my fear <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh as one of the guys tried to help me he said well listen i'm afraid of that too and he said because right there in that pit there that's god <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now if you remember that <SIL> there's nothing in here that can hurt you <SIL> even as hot as it gets <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when you think about that <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you try not to think too much while you're in there <SIL> although it's hard to do especially if you're thinking about how hot it is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but if you're listening to people praying <SIL> and they're praying with their heart and i tell you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because of how hot it gets in there <SIL> you'll hear people pray straight from their heart <SIL> not a bunch of real fancy words <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in a real comfortable setting yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> that heat <IVER>
will that sacred heat will <IVER>
bring <SIL> what's in your heart out <SIL> and sometimes you'll say stuff that doesn't even make sense <SIL> but <SIL> you say it <SIL> and it brings it out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that's what it's for <SIL> so i mean it's uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a struggle understanding that and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i i made it through all four rounds this time <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh i even sat up which was the first time <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's a struggle <SIL> but it's a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's necessary for the way i follow <SIL> if i didn't especially for men women have a purification every month <IVER>
with their cycle <VOCNOISE> uh that's <SIL> the way the indian people believe that many of the woman refer to it as they're on their moon <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because when the moon's out the moon is that sacred <SIL> and there's that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that life <VOCNOISE> women have that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh gift of life that they can give <SIL> uh men can't do that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> there's just a lot there <SIL> that uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow women go through that purification every month so women really don't need the sweat lodge <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but it's there for them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they do participate <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
i've been some places where some men refuse to sweat with women <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> sometimes i <VOCNOISE> felt <SIL> kinda weird about it <IVER>
just because uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> women have a medicine <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and probably because that was lacking in my life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i couldn't focus on what i needed to focus on when i heard a woman's voice in there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but then some of the elders sat me down and and the other thing about the sweat lodge is men go in there in shorts <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> women go in there in a long cotton dress <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you'll hear people say you go in there naked <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh that's not true <SIL> i mean uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some of the older men in older tribes and different tribes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
they'll be naked but they'll still go in with a huge towel on <IVER>
yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so it's not a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there was a man named sun bear <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> who was uh <SIL> recruiting women <SIL> yknow <SIL> and telling them they had to sweat naked <IVER>
yknow <SIL> so he could get a look at them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which is very disrespectful but <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's some psychos out there man i mean there's some psycho around here in town called rainbow eagle <SIL> <VOCNOISE> gave himself that name <IVER>
didn't earn it the indian way <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> didn't have it done through ceremony nothing like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and even the man that he followed for a while sitting in a rest home over in south dakota now <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because he's old <SIL> he's on his way out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he was a road man gave his life yknow for eighty nine tribes <SIL> to help them find and refine their connection with their spirituality that they'd lost <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um because of the missionaries <SIL> bringing christianity <SIL> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i've got nothing against christianity <SIL> but i got something against the way it was brought here <IVER>
and that's what i'm saying atoning for sins <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's quite a hypocrisy when you got a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents <UNKNOWN> and went to all my life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> over the door of the church was a picture of christopher columbus with <SIL> <SIL> a missionary <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a priest <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and all his men with his sword drawn <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now <SIL> i asked the priest <SIL> cold hard question <SIL> 
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> is that <SIL> the way jesus christ would have brought that here <SIL> well some people have their opinion and i said no <SIL> no <SIL> i say you you wear that collar <SIL> you do something about that if you don't <VOCNOISE> then i realize what a spineless person you are <SIL> but you'll never find me in your church again <SIL> so i've done what i've done but <VOCNOISE> there's a lot of people out there that'll read a book on native american spirituality <VOCNOISE> and they'll become self proclaimed spiritual leaders <SIL> uh they'll learn the sweats there's some people that have taken pictures of sweat lodges which you're not supposed to do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh they show step by step how to build one <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and tell <EXT-word_you> <SIL> that some kind of wood to build it out of <EXT-and> ninety percent of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um there's a way to do it <VOCNOISE> and there's a way to do it uh <SIL> it has to be done that way traditionally there was a reason for that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> because the people of this land were given specific instructions <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> from their creator through visions <VOCNOISE> through a woman called the <CUTOFF-bu=buffalo> white buffalo calf woman that came to the people and brought them <VOCNOISE> these ceremonies like the sweat lodge <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they brought them the sacred pipe <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's not a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not a belief thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a way of life <SIL> and it's a way of life that's still in danger of being snuffed out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but it won't be <SIL> it's just <SIL> it won't be <SIL> it's just we gotta be careful about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh how and what you do and if you look <EXT-yknow> native american spirituality or religion for lack of a better word <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah because our people believe that religion you can't uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you can't encompass one word <EXT-everything> that is in the one word <IVER>
<SIL> all of creation <SIL> into religion <SIL> all of what spirituality is into one word religion <HES-you> you can't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but when you say it's a <CUTOFF-spiritual> of spiritual nature <SIL> that's <SIL> yknow that's still leaving the door wide open that it's it's broad it's bigger than you or me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but that ah <SIL> that whole thing is um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow the people of the land had a <CUTOFF-sp=specific> a specific instructions <SIL> on how to do things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i i'm not saying they were perfect either <SIL> there were a lot of indian people and there are a lot of indian people out there that are crooked as a dog's hind leg <VOCNOISE> that's just the way it is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they're corrupt the money has corrupt them the lack of money has corrupted them power has corrupted them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um they wanna be a spiritual leader why i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to me it's an ego thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh this rainbow eagle guy had some kind of buffalo uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what do you call it a <EXT-buffalo> ceremony <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but he charged everybody <SIL> native people don't do that <SIL> i mean <SIL> traditional native people <CUTOFF-th=they> <SIL> <HES-you> <SIL> you don't charge people that wanna come learn about god <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's some people in california <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that say certain ceremonies were a native <SIL> thing and they buried a woman in the ground with a straw <VOCNOISE> told her it was some ritual of proving and over coming fear <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yet the lady was an asthmatic and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in her mouth and she couldn't breath and breathed in all the sand and died <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so the first thing they put in the paper is that another native ceremony shows us how <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> native american spirituality should be <SIL> outlawed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and if you look at any kind of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh spirituality religion that's out there native americans are only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can't have <VOCNOISE> that there's blood quantums <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> saying that if you have a fourth <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or a half <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and even <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you had two full bloods <SIL> from two different tribes <SIL> and they had a child <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the federal government still considers them a half blood <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> why i don't know <SIL> doesn't make sense <IVER>
<SIL> but the federal government and their lawyers have done that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the department of the interior <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> still considers native americans <SIL> <VOCNOISE> on the same level as a dog <SIL> they don't have <SIL> something wrong there <SIL> and that still goes on today after about six hundred years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and we got good people in this country that wanna do something about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but unfortunately <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=they> <EXT-yknow> what i'm finding <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> you got everybody's gotta choose their path <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there's the ones that'll get out there with their picket signs <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and raise hell <SIL> okay <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> me i don't wanna go to <UNKNOWN> jail and get arrested because i feel i won't do my people <SIL> any service by being in jail <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> but there are those that are out there that are <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> willing to do that <IVER>
warriors that are out there men and women that'll do that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh more power to them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> all i can do is pray about it <SIL> and that's what i suggest to everybody else <VOCNOISE> that's the most powerful thing that you can do <SIL> even one of the <EXT-nuns> <VOCNOISE> in high school <SIL> that taught me had a poster on the wall that said <SIL> <SIL> <SIL> <EXT-more> things are wrought in this world by prayer <SIL> then we'll ever know <IVER>
and that's true <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so that's the most powerful thing i can do <SIL> when i can turn it over to god and say god this is too damn big for me to handle <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you think you can work on maybe helping change this person's heart <VOCNOISE> or their mind <SIL> because i can't do that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> so <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i didn't mean to get <LAUGH-off_on_a_tangent_there> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<HES-in> <HES-in> much <HES-in> much other things <SIL> yknow that i'm <SIL> <UNKNOWN> coming to understand <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there's uh <SIL> yknow i just uh is <VOCNOISE> i had three spiritual leaders <SIL> tell me that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a great gift came with that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that there was it was no accident <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was supposed to happen <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh there's a word called synchronicity <IVER>
that um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> encompasses the <VOCNOISE> uh theory that <SIL> all things happen for a reason <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> even though it seems like it's chaos <SIL> even though it seems like it's an accident <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a flow <SIL> of spirit in this world things <SIL> are moving <SIL> at a pace that they're supposed to move at <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and things happen <SIL> and death is part of life <SIL> physical death <SIL> and that's one of the things i also learned through this was that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you don't die <SIL> you don't <SIL> physically <SIL> maybe <SIL> yknow <SIL> there's no denying that <SIL> but <SIL> spiritually <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not even physical death can break that <SIL> it won't <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-yeah> <SIL> and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people <SIL> i mean actually seeing <SIL> spirits <SIL> in other people in terms of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul <SIL> that's very true <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i could see <SIL> in certain people's <EXT-eyes> when i was in the hospital <SIL> the confusion <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-the> <SIL> unsure <SIL> feelings <SIL> yknow the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <SIL> i didn't there's something that i could see there that i can't explain and i still can't explain it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just <EXT-know> what i <EXT-see> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then i go and try and tell the psychologist psychiatrist well they want to put me on some kind of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> anti hallucinogenic <SIL> medication and i said well listen man <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm not hallucinating <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and these people that hear voices <VOCNOISE> they're not hallucinating <SIL> they're hearing voices of spirits <SIL> and in many cultures they'll tell you most the indigenous cultures <VOCNOISE> throughout the world will tell you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the history will show <VOCNOISE> that those people were revered as gifted <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> this is the only society <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <SIL> labels them <SIL> mentally ill <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <EXT-because> largely because of the fear of not knowing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and not knowing how to deal with the unseen <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah he did <IVER>
<SIL> there's no doubt in my mind that he <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> heard those voices now whether they were actual <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> audible voices <SIL> or <SIL> whether they were voices from the inside <IVER>
in his own mind <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> regardless it's part of that bad spirit that people have created <SIL> not the devil <SIL> not satan <SIL> to the native people he doesn't <EXT-exist> <SIL> and to me he doesn't exist <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's a piece of shit <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but he's real <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> and he's real because people give him that <IVER>
<SIL> they believe in him <SIL> they empower that <SIL> that <EXT-fear> of him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> empowers it <SIL> his existence <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when you got like minded people around yknow <SIL> <SIL> <SIL> you can create a spirit <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> a bad one <SIL> or a good one <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> this boy <SIL> <VOCNOISE> whatever he did <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> yeah there's no doubt in my mind that he either heard <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> internal voices or <SIL> ah actual audible voices of spirits that were <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah <SIL> misguided spirits <IVER>
while they were here <SIL> there are many people that were bad eggs man <SIL> 
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then they physically died <SIL> before they got a chance to live <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and when their spirit wakes up <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and finds out that they're physically dead and they can't do anything in a physical world anymore <VOCNOISE> they want to <SIL> draw themselves to especially if they were a bad person <SIL> <VOCNOISE-word_word> <SIL> they want to draw them to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the brightest thing <IVER>
<SIL> which are <SIL> children of light <IVER>
and as the way i put it it's kind of new agey and i don't like new agey stuff but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow it's <EXT-the> best example is moths <SIL> from the dark when you flip on a light <SIL> the moths will go right to it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a child like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a young man like that is very impressionable very young still <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh these bad spirits will be <SIL> flocked right to him <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so when he did that though i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's medication out there that can help people like i said i don't wanna see people with brain injury <SIL> <VOCNOISE> with mental illness <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or with any kind of disability <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> use that <SIL> as an excuse <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> for their behavior <SIL> because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if they were an asshole before their brain injury <SIL> they're gonna be <SIL> <VOCNOISE> an asshole after their brain injury five times <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> it's magnified <HES-and> <HES-and> <HES-or> <SIL> <EXT-yeah> they have that choice they can say well listen <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you don't understand and blah blah blah now i've tried that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but the best i can do now is try and advocate for myself in terms of listen <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh i hear what you're saying <SIL> but i'm trying to show you that <SIL> uh <SIL> and tell you how i work best <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so as long as you can try not to dictate to me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and allow me some freedom <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and give me goals of what you want accomplished and give me the freedom to accomplish them the way that i can do it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um not by quotas <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and deadlines and <SIL> crap like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i can show you what to do and <HES-that's> <HES-that's> the struggle i'm having right now i'm trying to find employment where people will <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> cut me some slack yknow and i wanted to do some driving but <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh because at least out on the road yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't have to put up with anyone's crap <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> long driving long distances is not good for me <SIL> focusing and concentrating <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and i i've had <VOCNOISE> yknow several accidents several tickets <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean i've even had uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow two other head injuries <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> as a result of <SIL> the one <SIL> <VOCNOISE> trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean it's <CUTOFF-ju=just> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah i mean when i when you come down to these things there's uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> people with mental illness and with a disability <SIL> <VOCNOISE> are trying to pawn off their responsibility onto <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> everybody but themselves <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow well the medical doctors if they would of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> seen this guy and given him medication he wouldn't of went out there and <VOCNOISE> killed somebody <SIL> yknow shoulda would have could have man <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if the guy stopped taking his medication of his own free will <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that was his responsibility to take that medicine every day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just like it's mine take mine every day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when i stop taking mine that was my responsibility which is why <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't wanna go to the legal system to try and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> make an excuse <SIL> even though there's a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> some law that protects people that if they were drunk <SIL> or <SIL> <VOCNOISE> on the influence of medication or <SIL> <VOCNOISE> or off the influence of medication <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <UNKNOWN> in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that they wouldn't be <VOCNOISE> <SIL> liable <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and i'm saying <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i could take that route <SIL> but it it would cost me a lot of money that i don't have <SIL> to get the legal defense <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it be just <VOCNOISE> best for me to take the responsibility like i have <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i sold the car that i had to my sister <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i'm going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed a lease for <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> but i'm gonna make them come after me <SIL> <LAUGH-yknow> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_mean_uh> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i already went to court once and <SIL> and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ev=even> well i even <CUTOFF-wi=with> even with the evidence being in my favor <SIL> i mean i was only at this place three months <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i didn't do any damage to it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and the walls did not need painted i wasn't there long enough to make them dirty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> their own person even went through on a first run through after i moved out <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and my mother and i cleaned that thing spotless top bottom bathrooms and washed the floors and mopped the floors and everything <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and uh their own person came through an said it rated the paint an a which meant according to their system a meant no <IVER>
no painting was needed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh well then <SIL> then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and they uh scratched out the first rating and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> changed it to a lower rating <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and even though that evidence was in front of a magistrate <IVER>
and he could see <SIL> uh i'd assume he's educated and not stupid otherwise he wouldn't be a magistrate <SIL> <VOCNOISE> could see that that person did that <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> and it was suspect <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah he still ruled in their favor <IVER>
<SIL> so i'm not gonna get any fairness or justice out of that but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh so they sent me the award saying that they decided in their favor and all that crap well <SIL> yknow fine <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but i'm not gonna <VOCNOISE> not gonna pay them till they contact me again <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> or take me to court again <SIL> yknow they got the money i don't <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i couldn't be part of a veterinary practice that uh did that <IVER>
<SIL> and unfortunately <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they have to do what the people with the pets say <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but it's just i couldn't be around that and <EXT-then> yknow i would go off on people that would do that bring that in <SIL> i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth <LAUGH-sometimes> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah i'm not a violent man either even as big as i am yknow yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

and none of the animals they profiled were pets <SIL> i mean a thirty six foot long python what the hell's a person doing with that as a pet <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they shouldn't be allowed to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then people treating a buffalo <SIL> like they could stand next to it and take a family picture <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> doesn't show any knowledge or respect to the animal <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-in> my opinion when that stuff happens when i see <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i see someone light the horns of a bull on fire in spain and torment the bull and then all of a sudden the bull gets the flames put out <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the bull runs his gourd through <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the person's leg and throws him around and kicks him right near death i don't have any sympathy for him <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh i'm not shocked to the bad behavior of the <CUTOFF-anima=animal> i don't consider it's justice <IVER>
well i mean <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well the humans that started it and the man narrating the thing said there wasn't a single animal that they profiled in the thing that uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> behaved the way it did on it's own accord <IVER>
<SIL> it behaved that way as a result of the way it was being treated by human beings <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i mean there's a i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah the animal therapy is very good thing my dog has been very <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> supportive been very <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know like you said the unconditional love part yknow i mean how you could <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you could <VOCNOISE> you could leave for a week and come back and they're <VOCNOISE> they're like ok <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm glad you're back yknow <SIL> <IVER>

<EXCLUDE> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> yes pets are <IVER>
okay <SIL> i was born in dayton ohio <SIL> i lived there almost thirty five years before moving to columbus in nineteen eighty one <SIL> uh lived in uh <SIL> north west columbus for eighteen years <SIL> uh moved last january a little farther west about five miles further west near hilliard <VOCNOISE> but still live in the city of columbus <SIL> uh so i've been here about eighteen nineteen years i like columbus also <SIL> i think it's a great city although the last three months i've threatened to move on more than one occasion because of all the traffic congestion and all of the road construction you just can't get anywhere <SIL> it's very frustrating <SIL> uh but other than that columbus is a great city <SIL> um <SIL> i went to this is something different about me most people don't know that uh it it existed in the the twentieth century but i went to an all girl catholic school for twelve years <SIL> uh so there were there were no boys and i wasn't in a classroom with boys until i got to college <SIL> uh i went to college at wright state university <SIL> uh my parents couldn't afford to send me so i had to work two years in high school two years after high school to pay my way through college <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> taught school for about eight and a half nine years and during that time got my masters degree in remedial reading <SIL> um taught for i <VOCNOISE> think i said this about eight and a half nine years and <SIL> my <SIL> life and career took a whole different turn and became president of my teachers' association or teachers' union and <VOCNOISE> that led to a job in political action because i'd always been active in politics from high school on <SIL> uh the first campaign i worked in was for john kennedy in nineteen sixty i was a freshman in high school and <VOCNOISE> continued working in campaigns in a volunteer status uh several different campaigns in ohio and in dayton where i came from <SIL> uh but moved to columbus to take a job as a political action consultant for the largest public employee union <VOCNOISE> did that for a couple of years till i went out in the field and negotiated labor contracts <SIL> um did that that's kind of stressful um um <SIL> so i decided to strike off on my own and try some public relations and marketing and did that and <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i'm <UNKNOWN-didn't> never been married <SIL> didn't plan that that wasn't a goal in life it just <LAUGH-never_occurred> <SIL> uh so i have no kids but i have a pet <SIL> and now i'm uh i call myself semi retired i get a small um yknow monthly retirement and then i supplement my income by doing things like this <SIL> i'm an independent contractor i do training i do um <VOCNOISE> different things yknow where people get my opinion i've done a couple of the um things with uh <SIL> lawyers looking yknow they do like mock trials <SIL> on real issues <SIL> and then you listen to all of the stuff and then you <SIL> <CUTOFF-p=pretend> yknow pretend that you're a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case <UNKNOWN> going to going into court so that's fun <SIL> so that's a little bit about me uh lets see <SIL> my family my mom and dad <SIL> um well i'm i'm <SIL> uh my mother was first generation <SIL> american my grandparents came to this country from hungary <SIL> and that was a neat experience i liked growing up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant in hungary <SIL> uh and he thought this was the <CUTOFF-g=greatest> greatest country in the world and that rubbed off on me i still do also <SIL> he always voted so <UNKNOWN> yknow <SIL> i learned at an early age that it's important to vote <SIL> um <SIL> my mom and dad were both alcoholics <SIL> um i have two brothers no sisters <SIL> one older than me one younger than me <SIL> um and i have no children but i have a pet that is my child <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and i always say pets are uh children you raise pets you spoil <VOCNOISE> so my my pet is <SIL> very spoiled <IVER>
that's right <LAUGH> <LAUGH-that's_right> <LAUGH> <SIL> it's a parakeet <IVER>
a parakeet yes <SIL> little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
oh <SIL> wow yeah <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i had that with uh <SIL> the parakeet i had before <VOCNOISE> their lifespan in the wild is about five years seven years in captivity and he was thirteen <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> the hardest <CUTOFF-bo=both> both the hardest and easiest thing i think i've ever done <SIL> was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him euthanized <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
hum <SIL> right <SIL> you know you have to you know you don't have a choice but at the same time you <CUTOFF-duh=don't> right you don't want them to suffer but you want to keep them <SIL> but <SIL> it is <VOCNOISE> whoops <SIL> oops <SIL> i hope i didn't move <IVER>
put my hand here <SIL> try to keep it out the line of the <SIL> wire <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah no problem <IVER>
yes <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
me too <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i really don't know i don't understand why they don't because to me <SIL> it's the most important freedom we have <SIL> and people v um <SIL> bitch and complain all the time <VOCNOISE> but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you don't because your voice <SIL> wasn't heard <SIL> um <SIL> when i was a political action consultant for the ohio education association i used to go around try to get teachers involved in politics <SIL> um and one of the things i would tell them is that <SIL> every vote is important john kennedy won if if <SIL> if you would take all of the the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation <VOCNOISE> by one vote per <CUTOFF-pers=precinct> <SIL> per precinct <SIL> one vote per precinct <SIL> yknow if there had just been one additional vote either way in any of those precincts yknow he would have lost <SIL> uh and so one vote does count <SIL> and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes <SIL> and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven <SIL> eighteen nineteen votes <SIL> um <SIL> if i knew the magic <SIL> reason why people don't vote <SIL> i could sell that <SIL> and make a <SIL> make a fortune <SIL> um but i don't know what it is <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
when i did school levy campaigns <SIL> uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is <SIL> what the <CUTOFF-c=campaign> the <VOCNOISE> campaign does on election day called get out the vote <VOCNOISE> that's the most important thing that can be done <SIL> um <SIL> i used to <SIL> always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school levy <VOCNOISE> get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district <SIL> and i would have the school district compare it to <SIL> parents and the first thing i'd do is register parents <SIL> because many of them <VOCNOISE> don't vote <SIL> uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country doesn't even begin to vote until they're forty <SIL> if i had known that when i was in college <SIL> and worked so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i couldn't vote till i was twenty one <SIL> and i was upset <SIL> yknow because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war <SIL> that was a big issue and i couldn't <SIL> uh i had to wait till i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that <SIL> yknow worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed <SIL> if i'd known that they weren't gonna vote at eighteen <SIL> and they were gonna wait until they were almost forty <SIL> i wouldn't of i wouldn't of wasted my time <SIL> um but anyway um <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade age <VOCNOISE> 
<VOCNOISE> and you register them <SIL> and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign <SIL> uh in ohio i think it's easier to do that because there is a law that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't think it's in primaries <VOCNOISE> but in general elections at eleven o'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the afternoon <VOCNOISE> they hafta list those who have voted they hafta put up a list of uh <SIL> registered voters and cross out those who have voted <SIL> so what i useta do is i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support <SIL> or <CUTOFF-wer=were> was undecided on the election <SIL> and i would cross off those that had voted <SIL> and then i had a list of those that hadn't <SIL> and i had people waiting at a phone bank <SIL> and i'd call them at work or at home and and i'd offer to take them to the polls <SIL> if you don't have a ride <SIL> uh we will take you to the polls <SIL> if you're worried about yknow someone watching your kids we have certified teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babysit for you while you go to vote <VOCNOISE> because i've also read studies that say people who are routed from their home or their office <SIL> yknow and are reminded to go vote <SIL> will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that <VOCNOISE> because what i did was is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say <SIL> hi this is roberta i'm calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote <SIL> and oh by the way <SIL> oh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levy and <SIL> and if you need a ride let me know we've got them set up for you <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> but yknow that's very <SIL> i mean <CUTOFF-eh=and> and and that's not getting people to vote <SIL> and encourage them to vote because they should that's a a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate <SIL> i don't know how you get people to vote <SIL> i don't know why they don't think it's important maybe because <SIL> we've had it too easy my <ERROR-go=godfather?> <SIL> my grandfather didn't <SIL> my grandfather didn't i mean there was a king and queen and yknow he had no right to vote <SIL> so that when he came here and he could <SIL> that was the most important thing in the world to him <SIL> yknow and that that he just passed it on to <SIL> yknow his daughter my mother <SIL> my father i don't know how he <SIL> it was important to him but it was always important to him and we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes <SIL> we talked about <SIL> issues and he said yknow it was important to to be heard <SIL> so i don't know if it was that <SIL> it got passed on parent wise or what it was <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
there's no issue <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> not specifically no <SIL> uh sometimes um little groups <SIL> of <VOCNOISE> sometimes you <CUTOFF-wou=would> <CUTOFF-i=if> if there was a college in a community when i was running a school levy campaign <SIL> um we would try to get them either registered <SIL> and and active in a campaign <SIL> um <SIL> but it was very difficult <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it's> it's sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park <SIL> active in voting <SIL> yknow there are certain little blocks of people <SIL> uh and on school levies the people who voted no which were senior citizens <SIL> i mean they they went to the polls in droves you didn't hafta yknow the the the <CUTOFF-h=hope> <SIL> the hope there was that they wouldn't go to vote <LAUGH> <SIL> on the school levy <VOCNOISE> uh but actually trying to get college kids involved <SIL> i haven't really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself <SIL> it might be a little pocket of a campaign but <SIL> nothing big <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
if if you didn't own let's say on a school levy and you didn't uh you <SIL> you pay taxes i always get because i rent and i always get very upset and i'm very angry when people say <SIL> well you don't hafta pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes <SIL> my rent goes up <SIL> it's built into the rent <SIL> uh at least it's <VOCNOISE> it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord <LAUGH> <SIL> uh and i don't i've never lived any place where my rent didn't go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct f proportion and beyond <CUTOFF-j=just?> yknow uh of what the levy was <VOCNOISE> uh so that would be the first thing i'd say <SIL> and then i'd also say that yknow <VOCNOISE> uh because uh a <CUTOFF-l=lot> a <CUTOFF-l=lot> a number of reasons that people don't vote for school levies now is because they don't have kids <SIL> in the schools <SIL> yknow but education is the foundation of a democracy <SIL> and if you don't have an educated citizenry <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-y=your> your <CUTOFF-v=voters?> <SIL> democracy could go down the drain <SIL> um that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or yknow the the university of virginia and believed in education yknow because he said without an educated citizenry you won't understand the issues <SIL> yknow but it's very difficult today <SIL> to get to people <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i've talked to some <SIL> i've <VOCNOISE> <SIL> almost college age students and they don't see the relationship you can <VOCNOISE> talk logic to them all you want and it's not like the logic gets to them <SIL> and you can talk history all you want and it doesn't mean anything to them and i don't know why <SIL> i wish i did but i don't know why <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i think the latter i don't think it'll make any difference <VOCNOISE> the kids that i know <SIL> in uh junior high and in in yknow college <SIL> uh it just doesn't make any difference to them and they don't like those classes they think they're boring they think it has no relevance to their life <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <NOISE> <SIL> it <SIL> it might and yknow good teachers do that i i <CUTOFF-us=used i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity based teaching <SIL> um <SIL> and i was doing some volunteer work at dublin schools it was supposed be one of the better schools in the area <SIL> and i thought there'd be all sorts of creative things going on and there wasn't it was still read the chapter write the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought <SIL> how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things <SIL> um <SIL> i'm not sure there's so much <SIL> influence from the media <SIL> uh and i say media broad based so you'd be it print media or tv <SIL> um that has this culture today of um <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> stars and yknow media of of <VOCNOISE> phenomenons and <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> they don't see the relevance and i don't think they hear from their parents like i did <VOCNOISE> the importance of voting and that's where it comes from their parents don't vote <SIL> so if their parents don't vote they aren't <SIL> uh again i don't know what the the answer is <SIL> um but it's very scary what's gonna happen in the next couple of generations <VOCNOISE> the only <SIL> <VOCNOISE> good thought for me is i think about this <SIL> is that i won't be here to see the disintegration of the democracy although i have great faith too <SIL> i have great faith in democracy <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if there were an issue <SIL> i think kids would <CUTOFF-ge=get> if if there were <SIL> kids in college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people didn't think was important <SIL> or had no real relevance to their lives <SIL> i mean <UNKNOWN-do> <SIL> i think the kids would <VOCNOISE> would rally immediately <SIL> and <CUTOFF-th=the> the issue right now is that there's nothing there <IVER>
right <LAUGH> <IVER>
the <CUTOFF-ri=right> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it <SIL> it might <SIL> uh it might <SIL> um i was gonna say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campaigns i've seen in recent years utilizing college age students has been clinton's campaign both times <SIL> uh he knew he needed to get a base to increase <SIL> um his chances of winning the election <SIL> and did especially in the first campaign in and and i believe that was ninety two <VOCNOISE> did a really super job of organizing college students because that's when you're at your most um <SIL> well when you believe in things and you're at your most idealistic <SIL> and you would think that yknow <VOCNOISE> kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that <SIL> um <SIL> in addition to that <SIL> and as an <SIL> under current it wasn't <SIL> overt in the clinton campaign <VOCNOISE> but i know when i talked to people <SIL> uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion is an a very divisive issue in this country and i think it it does mobilize people <VOCNOISE> but it also divides them <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-d=definitively> definitively almost like in vietnam almost like that war divided people <SIL> um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton <VOCNOISE> because it was the difference between protecting roe versus wade and not <SIL> and in protecting choice yknow i um <SIL> and i i'm starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign there i've seen a couple of editorials in the paper <SIL> about yknow the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three <SIL> supreme court justices and at that if you want to protect that right <SIL> you've gotta vote with the candidate who's gonna put the best justices on the supreme court <SIL> and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way <CUTOFF-b=both> <SIL> both in ninety two and again in four years <CUTOFF-la=later> in ninety six <SIL> uh and i think that's gonna happen again <SIL> uh because the <VOCNOISE> the candidates and i'm telling you my politics here <LAUGH-very_clearly> and early <VOCNOISE> but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already <SIL> i know which one will protect the right for choice <SIL> uh and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> uh i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i don't think it's an <SIL> issue that if you <VOCNOISE> did <SIL> overtly and said yknow support candidate a over candidate b <VOCNOISE> because they'll protect abortion rights <VOCNOISE> that's gonna divide the country and not keep us together <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that's essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it's right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme <VOCNOISE> court was right or wrong <SIL> it's been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it <SIL> would create too much <SIL> <VOCNOISE> too many problems for people <SIL> yknow which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but yknow it's too late <IVER>
right <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum <SIL> which meant she'd never get the nomination because of who controls the republican party <IVER>

<SIL> she was but i had admired her more <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah because um <VOCNOISE> uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again <VOCNOISE> that's gonna be the litmus test <VOCNOISE> and it's just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party <VOCNOISE> they would nominate such people as uh mcgovern who hadn't yknow who i voted for but had no chance of winning <VOCNOISE> over the years i have moderated my <SIL> hardline left of center liberal stance <SIL> <VOCNOISE> for more of a moderate <VOCNOISE> middle of the road <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because it's easier to get that sold to the american public <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> while <UNKNOWN-guh> <SIL> i think dole was correct <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think she yeah she shot herself in the foot <SIL> i don't she would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is <SIL> being controlled by the extreme right wing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> which is a problem for the republicans they moved they need to move towards the middle <VOCNOISE> which i think george w is trying to do <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> uh <SIL> uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell i tell them yes and i'm an <CUTOFF-in=indifferent> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> an indifferent liberal <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if she could have become the candidate <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she might have been able to beat <SIL> <CUTOFF-r=??> <HES-I> i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but yknow <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> and in in election times <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a weekend <SIL> is a couple of centuries uh uh a year <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is an <SIL> eon <LAUH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> so anything can happen between now and then but <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> uh dole had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> which is basically where clinton <SIL> placed himself in the two elections he ran in <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> most real democrats the warren beatty's of the world and many <VOCNOISE> yknow congressmen <HES-and> and senators dislike clinton <VOCNOISE> because <HES-they> <CUTOFF-di=didn't> they didn't think he was democratic enough <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i liked clinton because as i said over the years <HES-uh> i've learned that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> extremes in either party don't get elected <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and that if you want someone <SIL> that has your <VOCNOISE> <SIL> general interest at heart you hafta find someone who's a moderate and can can appeal to everybody <VOCNOISE> i used to tell school districts when i went in to tell them how to to put together a school levy campaign that basically you had <VOCNOISE> the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my <SIL> age <VOCNOISE> but that there was about <VOCNOISE> thirty percent of the people who were <SIL> were for you <SIL> with the yes votes thirty percent who were automatically against you the no votes <VOCNOISE> and thirty percent in between <VOCNOISE> i told them ignore the no votes <SIL> yknow just <SIL> just don't get them upset with you you don't want them yknow working actively against you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lock up <CUTOFF-y=your> <VOCNOISE> your thirty that are with you make sure you <SIL> yknow you do something with them but <SIL> this group the the middle thirties i call them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you had to massage them <VOCNOISE> and that's what clinton did so well and that's what dole could have done i'm not sure if george w is gonna be able to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh because to get the the nomination eventually he's gonna come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i'm anti abortion <VOCNOISE> i'm pro gun he's already said the pro gun <VOCNOISE> and that's because it's going against <SIL> what most americans are saying <VOCNOISE> dole i think represented where most americans are if you look at opinion polls <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um so <CUTOFF-y=you> yknow you hafta find a way to <CUTOFF-m=moderate> to moderate that stance <SIL> uh whether you're republican or a democrat <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah <SIL> i think it's possible <VOCNOISE> it'd have to take the right combination <SIL> of uh someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people <VOCNOISE> i think dole would have been a good candidate i would have been hard pressed <VOCNOISE> i mean uh to some of her issues i don't like but <VOCNOISE> when she came out <VOCNOISE> uh and said her her her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns <SIL> uh she went up a <CUTOFF-n=notch?> couple of notches in in in my estimation because i wasn't sure where she'd be <VOCNOISE> i thought she'd have to sell herself as hardline with the hardline republicans <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then i wouldn't have been able to vote for her <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
except you couldn't come right out and say you wouldn't you didn't want to vote for her because she was a woman there'd have to be an under current <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed <SIL> they're the older citizens <SIL> um <SIL> many in my generation uh they'd just probably be <VOCNOISE> because <HES-I'm> i'm the early baby boom i'm i'm the first of the baby boom <VOCNOISE> uh and that's when the woman's movement started and many men there still haven't always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the <VOCNOISE> the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> there there's a a whole world of difference between their attitudes in a lot of things and <VOCNOISE> yknow women's minority issues uh they just second hand to them it it doesn't <SIL> yknow <SIL> it's <SIL> not <SIL> like it was for us which was a sea change <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for them it's normal <VOCNOISE> so and more of those people are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in the voting population <SIL> if they would vote <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yknow you'd have to find a candidate who would know how to do what clinton did in ninety two and get out that college vote <IVER>
that that um <VOCNOISE> that's an interesting question because he was a <CUTOFF-s=serious> <SIL> a serious contender last time i haven't heard his name this time <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> what people say they would do <CUTOFF-th=that> yknow that they like him <SIL> because he is um intelligent charismatic <VOCNOISE> uh all those <CUTOFF-th=those> those neat things that you need to <VOCNOISE> to be elected today <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and a lot of people said they would vote for him but what they say in polls they don't know if it would translate over but yeah i think he could <VOCNOISE> i think the right candidate could and i think mike coleman this year <VOCNOISE> uh in the columbus race showed that <VOCNOISE> i mean he crossed <VOCNOISE> gender lines he crossed <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> party lines he crossed over into all of the city <VOCNOISE> and winning even dorothy teater's <SIL> precinct which surprised me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <HES-and_not> and not by just a little small margin i think it was two hundred and some votes which is pretty substantial <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-ri=right> well <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well teater's a school board member for columbus <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH-right> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's that's really hard to say um <VOCNOISE> if she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran <SIL> negatives don't work in columbus <VOCNOISE> columbus really does have a heart <SIL> and that just doesn't play <VOCNOISE> in columbus what plays in the state <SIL> and and the people who ran her campaign ran voinovich's campaign and <VOCNOISE> betty montgomery's campaign and and that negative stuff worked statewide <VOCNOISE> that doesn't work so well in columbus <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i i think that it'd <SIL> even a younger woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and i like to think that age doesn't matter but she came across as old to me also <VOCNOISE> and i like to think i'm not prejudiced on <SIL> on any issue but if there's uh <VOCNOISE> someone who had been right on the issues <SIL> i don't care if she was old i would have voted for her she just didn't support the issues i supported <VOCNOISE> she was wrong on <VOCNOISE> uh i i didn't like that she tried to use um the police chief <SIL> in such a negative way by saying that um <VOCNOISE> coleman had voted for a raise for the chief <VOCNOISE> well yes he voted for a raise for the chief but he voted for a raise for the the police <SIL> officers <SIL> it's just that yknow the police chief's was tied to his <VOCNOISE> and i don't like people who try to manipulate facts <VOCNOISE> uh and and that was manipulating the facts i didn't like that she was um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-ag=against> against <VOCNOISE> the the the tiff <SIL> uh and polaris once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong and i don't think it was wrong to begin with <VOCNOISE> but once it was voted and in place i thought our reputation was on the line and for her to try to use another divisive issue just to get elected <VOCNOISE> didn't sit well with me <VOCNOISE> um so i don't even if she had a lot of charisma <VOCNOISE> charisma doesn't mean as much to me <SIL> as a person's stand 
on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can't really answer that question how they would have voted <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh because i didn't think that mike coleman exactly had charisma either <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
his youth <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh and that's really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in nineteen ninety two because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> uh uh uh <VOCNOISE> i haven't said it yet but <UNKNOWN> yknow anyone who listening to this tape or you would be able to know i'm a democrat and generally vote democratic although <VOCNOISE> i'll tell you i <SIL> i did vote for <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-Gre=Greg> greg lashuka once and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style <VOCNOISE> and he hasn't been bad for the city but <VOCNOISE> um i'm generally a democrat <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and i've only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in ninety two early on that clinton was gonna win just by <VOCNOISE> <SIL> being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend <VOCNOISE> and a waiter came up and um <VOCNOISE> he said something about yknow <VOCNOISE> and i can't remember how we got started on the topic <SIL> yknow just taking my my order for a restaurant but he said something about um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh dole was too old <VOCNOISE> and this was a young guy he was in college <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i knew there was there was a <CUTOFF-s=sort> a <CUTOFF-s=sort> a sort of a shift <VOCNOISE> people wanted someone <VOCNOISE> <SIL> with younger ideas <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> a new vision they didn't want the world war two vision anymore <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought <VOCNOISE> do they really understand the difference <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> issues <SIL> and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clinton <VOCNOISE> so i think for the average voter that does have a <VOCNOISE> a lot of sway <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'm not sure yet <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> at least based on money raised it looks like george w could trample almost anybody <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but george w hasn't gotten out there in the fray yet and given too many answers to <SIL> issues <VOCNOISE> he talks about compassionate conservativism and i don't know what that means <VOCNOISE> yknow i i want answers to specific questions as to what does compassionate conservative mean but <VOCNOISE> i don't think that i'm <SIL> uh <SIL> average in that i don't go for the the the slick image <CUTOFF-j=just> bothers me <VOCNOISE> um he has the potential of <CUTOFF-ch=trampling> of trampling gore i think that gore will be the the nominee no matter what bradley does gore has it sewn up because he's the insider <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> at <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
yeah i <CUTOFF-thi=think> uh i think they're both boring <VOCNOISE> if you look at the the image thing <VOCNOISE> they're both fairly wooden neither one of them seems comfortable in front of a camera <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh it's interesting on <SIL> on bradley <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my boyfriend is is big in sports <SIL> he's he's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not as liberal as i am he's a little bit on the conservative side <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and he but he would support bradley simply because he was a <CUTOFF-b=basketball> <VOCNOISE> a a former uh basketball player <VOCNOISE> and i'm about ready to say to him at some point in time yknow if he becomes president he's you're gonna hate him because he has all of these big government things and you're against big government <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um so i don't think people always always see that but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um between gore and bradley i don't see much difference quite frankly bradley's the more liberal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> gore i think understands the need to compromise but i think gore will be the <SIL> the candidate i don't think bradley will be able to go past <SIL> all of the work that gore's been doing for eight years as vice president <IVER>
well see that's not proved out by the <SIL> the approval ratings he still has <SIL> higher approval rating than reagan had in his last eighteen months so yknow people still like what he what he's done <VOCNOISE> i think that that <SIL> um that yknow people don't like all the crap that went with him as the <ERROR-pundints=pundits> on tv <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <EXT-they> say that and they're they're still trying to get him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which is what they would have done <EXT-to> elizabeth dole <VOCNOISE> they wouldn't have been able to attack <SIL> on the issues so they'd find other things to get <SIL> get her on so they start bringing out all these women and all that stuff on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> most people didn't care about it <SIL> they didn't care about it before the election they didn't care about it <SIL> during his campaign they didn't care about it during his presidency <VOCNOISE> it <EXT-was> <SIL> <EXT-some> <SIL> republican right wing <SIL> i don't know what who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow he may have been a <EXT-cad> yknow he may have <SIL> yknow but <VOCNOISE> she was twenty-one it's not like it was someone who couldn't make up her own mind what she wanted to do <VOCNOISE> yknow and he may have been stupid and a cad uh but i don't wanna know about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> on day one when it hit the the news <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i didn't want to know about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and on the end when he was <SIL> yknow not impeached <SIL> i didn't wanna know about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and in between i didn't wanna know about it and they just kept <SIL> angering me because there were other things i wanted <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the government to do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and this congress is the worst i've ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to <VOCNOISE> be on the <EXT-pulse> of of where america is on such issues as gun control and women's rights and and things that are important to people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> they they've tried to make pseudo issues out of clinton and then they tried to make a pseudo issue out of yknow giving a tax cut <VOCNOISE> people don't want a tax cut when it's going to affect their social security or affect <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh the the the deficit <IVER>
yknow to get a a four or five dollar a <EXT-year> tax cut <IVER>
when they're giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who's making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i don't care if i get five dollars that won't even buy me a tank of gas today <VOCNOISE> keep the money <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and do something good with it <IVER>
so um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> even republicans are like that <IVER>
uh i have a friend in new jersey or two friends <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh a married couple she's a <CUTOFF-de=democrat> a lifelong democrat he's been a lifelong republican <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and there's always interesting discussions when um when i go to visit and i went to visit them <VOCNOISE> few weeks before clinton was formally impeached last year <VOCNOISE> and i just decided i wasn't gonna bring it up <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and i'd been there three four days and finally at breakfast one morning henry said well you haven't talked about clinton and the impeachment yet and i said henry <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because he's the republican i said <VOCNOISE> i don't even wanna go there <SIL> let i said i don't even think we we wanna get involved in that conversation he says well he says i can understand you saying that but i thought you'd yknow i wanna tell you where i am <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he said when this whole thing started <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i sat down and wrote <SIL> every one of my <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um new jersey representatives <SIL> all of my senators and all of the congress people in new jersey <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and told them that i will never <SIL> ever in my life <SIL> vote republican again <SIL> because of the way this has has played out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean and this was a republican a lifelong republican he says i will <SIL> always now vote democrat because this was just so stupid and such a waste of my my time <VOCNOISE> the country's time <VOCNOISE> the country's money <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh when there are better things to be dealing with and a lot of republicans felt that way you <ERROR-rad=had> to be really extreme right wing <VOCNOISE> to feel other than that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> except here in central ohio <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
right <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
doesn't even <IVER>
right <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i wouldn't <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <IVER>
there generally tends be at least one or two republicans i vote for each <SIL> <ERROR-eat=each> <SIL> each election now sometimes i voted straight democrat because i <EXT-just> yknow i even voted for dorothy teater the first time she ran for county commissioner <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and and i liked what she was saying but then her votes <SIL> <VOCNOISE> later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i <CUTOFF-d=didn't> i didn't vote for her after that <VOCNOISE> but the first time she ran for county commissioner <VOCNOISE> i did it one because she was a woman and i like yknow i i when possible i like to vote for women <SIL> 
<VOCNOISE> if they hold yknow enough of my views <SIL> i'm not gonna vote for a woman <SIL> just because they're a woman <SIL> and i'm not gonna vote for a democrat just because they're a democrat <SIL> they better have <UNKNOWN> uh yknow at least and <CUTOFF-I=I> and i don't need a hundred percent <SIL> uh so that a agreement with my views but i'd like they'd be at in the ninety to ninety five percent range <SIL> um but <SIL> yeah uh i'll uh i don't tend to vote straight party line either <SIL> as i said i've i've moderated from when i was <SIL> uh <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> college <SIL> to today part of the the aging process and <SIL> also partly because <SIL> i've <SIL> i've noticed that to get things done you hafta have a center <SIL> and it's the center that tends to rule <SIL> when i was in college <SIL> um <SIL> we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it <SIL> and some of the construction people in dayton came out with one that said america love it or leave it <SIL> uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it's america love it <SIL> and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you don't let them <SIL> yknow have bad manners at the table and you don't let them run around with the wrong yknow kids and you want them to behave well <SIL> yknow that's how i see america now and <SIL> and america's become more centrist <SIL> uh and when it <SIL> deviates from that either way that's when people become upset <SIL> um <SIL> so i just think it's important and i <SIL> i remember when um <VOCNOISE> who was the other president that i voted for that won <VOCNOISE> carter <SIL> uh <SIL> black leaders would meet with him once a week and then they'd come out and hold this press conference and complain about he didn't do this for blacks and he didn't do <CUTOFF-th=that> enough for blacks he didn't do this and he didn't do that <SIL> and i used to say <CUTOFF-so=some> to some my black friends <VOCNOISE> don't you see what you're doing don't you see that greater implications of this <SIL> oh no we need to have him move faster i said <SIL> yknow that'd be great <SIL> in an ideal world this isn't an ideal world <SIL> you hafta take it a step at a time whether you like it or not <SIL> <SIL> i said what you're gonna do is you're gonna make it look like he is so bad in all the issues you're gonna give people a reason to vote against him <VOCNOISE> then if any big issue comes up <VOCNOISE> that's just gonna be added to everything else <SIL> i said what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and praise him and that he's doing a good job and that we're moving along steadily <SIL> uh and i yknow i don't think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means <SIL> um i made that mistake when i was president the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy passed <SIL> so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all the leaking <CUTOFF-w=walls?> yknow <SIL> uh ceilings all of the peeling floors all the the bad chalk boards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff <SIL> and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said we're not gonna support those <SIL> and they voted no <SIL> so the next time we did an opposite track we went in and we said yknow um the <VOCNOISE> eighteen months later when the board put <ERROR-anoder=another> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-bal=balance> <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-v=vote> <SIL> levy on the the ballot <SIL> we said these are great schools we have great teachers look at this kid he's learning to read he's made six months improvement in three months and all that kind <SIL> <CUTOFF-ima=image> it was <SIL> image <SIL> and it we were saying the same thing yknow we want to continue this we want to make even this better <SIL> um <SIL> we learned to say the negatives in a positive way and that's important <SIL> yknow and and you need to get that <CUTOFF-c=center> that <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> you need to appeal to the center <SIL> american's don't like extreme <SIL> liberals they don't like extreme conservatives <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-th=they> they want <SIL> they want peace <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
i think it's the right <SIL> position to take <SIL> um but it <SIL> it like abortion that's one of the the big <CUTOFF-i=issues> <SIL> issues that divide people very quickly <SIL> uh i think it's moderating somewhat <SIL> uh as the gay activists continue their campaigns <SIL> um but that's one where a candidate has to tread very carefully <SIL> um i was proud that coleman said it and didn't <SIL> and didn't back down on that <SIL> um they <SIL> told me a little bit about his character <SIL> um <SIL> i don't know that i can answer your question straight forward because <SIL> i believe in gay <CUTOFF-ri=rights> <SIL> i believe in anybody's rights <SIL> <UNKNOWN-I_don't_know?> <SIL> what happens between consenting adults in a bedroom is their business not mine <IVER>
<EXCLUDE-right> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not if he'd been as open about it <CUTOFF-a=as> as he was here <SIL> um <SIL> yknow clinton did that also and and thought he'd be able to <SIL> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-segre=segregate> or not segregate desegregate the uh the the military and found out with his first <SIL> action <SIL> as president that <SIL> there there's a strong backlash against that at least nation wide and and and in the military <VOCNOISE> but i thought it was the right stance <SIL> um <IVER>
because it's more open <SIL> um <SIL> and you couch it in terms of civil rights <SIL> um <SIL> my boyfriend's <SIL> thinks it's wrong morally <SIL> but doesn't think we ought to be discriminating against <SIL> uh he he thinks it's a sin <VOCNOISE> therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through yknow talking to them religion wise <SIL> um <SIL> i don't think it's a sin i think that <SIL> um your sexuality <SIL> is genetic based <SIL> and that <SIL> i <SIL> you can no more change <SIL> your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put a different <SIL> um <SIL> whatever those <VOCNOISE> eye <CUTOFF-p=pieces> pieces are <SIL> contacts <SIL> i don't wear glasses so i can never remember those terms <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> but that's just cosmetic <SIL> <SIL> and anyone who tries to change their sexual orientation that's cosmetic too <SIL> uh <SIL> and again <UNKNOWN-whyuh> my belief is whatever happens between consenting adults is their business not mine <SIL> um <SIL> so i don't know that <SIL> anyone could change it <UNKNOWN> <SIL> what was your question again <IVER>
why people <IVER>
because of the gay activism <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah i was gonna say most them are <IVER>
i think so because i <UNKNOWN> <SIL> i <IVER>
when <SIL> in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people <SIL> on t v and then you start seeing a couple of black people on t v and then there was the jeffersons and although i found that jeffersons offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and <SIL> made fun of of of black people <SIL> in many ways in retrospect <SIL> it was trend setting <SIL> and what it did in in even in putting blacks <SIL> in <SIL> um <SIL> advertisements on t v <SIL> young kids saw them <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-a=and> and saw those ads and saw those t v programs <SIL> and so it became <SIL> uh <SIL> a part of everyday life <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=and> and <VOCNOISE> the more you see something the more it <CUTOFF-be=becomes> <VOCNOISE> becomes more acceptable <SIL> so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now we'll look back on those t v programs and <VOCNOISE> think they were trend setting instead of stereotypical <SIL> um <SIL> but it i'm sure it does have uh <SIL> some influence because <SIL> i think it did <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> it wasn't <SIL> the <SIL> only thing that had an influence <SIL> but it was one of the little <UNKNOWN> <SIL> pieces <SIL> of the puzzle that that helps <SIL> i think matthew shepherd helped <SIL> also <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not in my lifetime <SIL> he'd hafta <CUTOFF-b=be> <SIL> probably be a closet gay 
i mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military <SIL> and just as long as people don't know that they don't feel threatened <SIL> see <CUTOFF-a=and> and and i <CUTOFF-ha=have> i uh i <CUTOFF-d=don't> i don't understand that mindset i really don't i don't know why <SIL> uh a man feels threatened by a having gay near them <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i have a couple of gay friends and and one of my friends always says um <SIL> yknow does <SIL> every man like every woman he sees is he attracted to every woman and yknow want to go to bed with every woman <SIL> yknow what makes a man think that just because i'm gay <VOCNOISE> i might be interested in him yknow that's the height of arrogance <SIL> um yknow but but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i don't know but <SIL> it's not a mindset i have so it's hard for me to understand <IVER>
<LAUGH-well_yeah> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-umhum> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-it_might_be> <IVER>

yeah i don't understand it i really have a hard time understanding yknow <VOCNOISE> they're not after you <SIL> they just want to live a life <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i'm not sure where my father would have been and my father was very liberal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh more so even than my mother <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because if it's not something that's part of your culture every day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow and and you've been told it's wrong and the catholic church said it was wrong as <ERROR-mots=most> <SIL> most religions do <VOCNOISE> i'm sure he would've <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow had some <SIL> concern but i think his his <VOCNOISE> intellect <SIL> would eventually have worked it out especially if you sat down and talked with him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he wouldn't have done yknow there wouldn't have been any gay bashing with him and <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there wouldn't have been <SIL> yknow what happened yknow to the the black man in jasper texas and the yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh the <UNKNOWN> the shepard boy in in <VOCNOISE> what was that oklahoma <SIL> uh yknow he wouldn't of <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
hate crime is a is an <SIL> is an <SIL> interesting <SIL> term <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> all crimes all murders <SIL> are hate related i uh <SIL> i'm not sure <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it that's <SIL> uh it it's difficult i <SIL> we had civil rights laws many people were opposed to those but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was uh in an effort to correct <SIL> years <VOCNOISE> of <SIL> institutionalized racism <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=and> and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> a crime is a crime and yknow are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder <VOCNOISE> and there's already a a law on the books so i don't think we need to have <SIL> a hate crime <SIL> over and above that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-th=the> <CUTOFF-the=the> the people who murdered matthew shepard <SIL> should be tried and hopefully <VOCNOISE> convicted on the facts <VOCNOISE> and shouldn't have anything else added into it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh affirmative action programs and the busing did to people it's going to turn people against <SIL> uh <UNKNOWN> gays like it turned people against blacks for a while although <SIL> ultimately i think it did make a difference <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-ha=had> <SIL> i had a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in uh opening up restaurants in the south <SIL> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> marching and yknow going to yknow opening the schools in the south <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> i said to her one day are you disappointed that <SIL> things aren't better <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh yknow that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that wasn't my goal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my goal wasn't to change hearts and minds <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my goal was to change behavior <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and the behavior changed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> except now <SIL> i never thought i would live to see an <VOCNOISE> all white jury <SIL> convict white men <SIL> <VOCNOISE> of <ERROR-com=committing?> of killing a black man <SIL> we're in hearts and minds now <SIL> <IVER>

short north <SIL> it's in the short north <SIL> but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's so much fun <VOCNOISE> it's absolutely so much fun because <SIL> it's really weird <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> you normally don't get hit on by girls <VOCNOISE> when you go to a regular dance club <SIL> but when you go to axis you don't get hit on by girls you get hit on by guys <SIL> i danced with glow sticks and i've had i had like seven guys come up to me in one night and they're just like can can you like <SIL> can you do that for me <EXCLUDE-anyway> <IVER>
because apparently they <SIL> apparently they get really fascinated by <SIL> the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i do that for i do it right in front of their face and they'd be like dude that <EXCLUDE-dude_that_thanks> <IVER>
<SIL> and apparently that's a way of <ERROR-inishing=initiating> a conversation <SIL> um one of the guys that i usually go clubbing with he's the one that got me into the glow stick dancing and he said uh <SIL> he said it's like a sign that says <EXCLUDE-come> hit on me and i'm like oh great that's that's just what i need <SIL> no it doesn't bother me <SIL> doesn't bother me <SIL> i just <VOCNOISE> i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i sort of just i'm just like not yknow i'm straight <SIL> if they start <SIL> if they start getting really <VOCNOISE> yknow really pushy about it i'm just like i'm straight <SIL> but a lot of times it's really funny because i'll get in a conversation with em and they'll be like <SIL> you're straight aren't you <SIL> i'm like yeah <SIL> they'll <SIL> yeah they <SIL> i don't know how but they must <SIL> they <SIL> it's just being <SIL> i must guess it must be the way i talk or <SIL> or or something but <SIL> i think i keep a lot of them away because i do a lot of really <SIL> i do a lot of really robust movements <SIL> with my glow sticks i'm like flailing about and <SIL> yknow it's like this <UNKNOWN> i got this wide berth around me <SIL> yeah it's it's not one of these it's one of these and yeah it's <SIL> yeah <SIL> um-hum <SIL> hum <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<SIL> <EXCLUDE-yeah> <SIL> they'll just take one scripture and they'll expand it <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and and they'll just <VOCNOISE> run with that one scripture <SIL> and then there are also churches that will just <SIL> deletes and they'll <CUTOFF-d=do> <SIL> in the <SIL> in <CUTOFF-mi=mind> in their minds they'll delete certain sections of the scripture that they don't like <SIL> first corinthians chapter twelve talks about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um spiritual gifts <SIL> and that's one of the big things that i'm into <SIL> down here in columbus and the fact that they still exist <SIL> like <SIL> healing people and <SIL> spiritual gifts like healing people and and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the extremely taboo <SIL> um religious topic <SIL> among <SIL> a lot of churches is the gift of tongues <SIL> whether it's dead whether it's not <SIL> whether it's inspired whether it's not inspired <SIL> yadda yadda blah blah <SIL> well <SIL> i hadn't even heard about it until i got to columbus because <SIL> and and i know the bible pretty well <SIL> and <SIL> i hadn't even heard about it until i got to columbus and i get to columbus and i'm like <SIL> okay this is pretty cool <SIL> i went home and i'm talking to some people in my parents' church and <SIL> they're like <SIL> oh yeah <SIL> um we just don't really talk about that very often and i'm just <IVER>
<SIL> why i mean it's part of the scripture that you say you believe in a hundred percent then why don't you <VOCNOISE> why don't you talk about it <SIL> and the problem is that <SIL> they don't <VOCNOISE> they don't know the answer <SIL> <SIL> and if they don't know the answer if they can't give a firm <SIL> this is the answer then they avoid it <SIL> <EXCL-I> try and find it <VOCNOISE> i try and find <VOCNOISE> for me <SIL> what has become the best answer <SIL> yknow if i don't <SIL> if i don't <CUTOFF-bel=believe> <SIL> if i don't believe something or i don't know <SIL> what to believe about something <SIL> i'll go and i'll find an answer for myself <SIL> i'm not gonna take somebody else's answer <SIL> and if i do take someone else's answer they better be able to back it up <SIL> yknow <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> well i know a lot of people that do <SIL> but i know a lot of people that don't <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um do the theological discussions no <VOCNOISE> no unless <SIL> unless you're seeking that out i mean <SIL> i go to the vineyard church it's up in it's up in uh <SIL> um westerville <SIL> and there's about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's about probably six thousand of us <SIL> it's one the biggest churches in ohio <SIL> and um <SIL> but if you want to find something in that church you can find it you can find a discussion group about anything <SIL> it's just a matter of finding it <SIL> and <SIL> within any <VOCNOISE> within any <CUTOFF-d=denomination> <SIL> denomination or within any religion <SIL> you go as deep as you want to go <SIL> yknow there are people that'd just go on sunday mornings there are people who just go on easter there are people who <SIL> go monday wednesday tuesday <SIL> and then sunday nights and saturday nights and <SIL> are very very very <SIL> into that <SIL> and i mean <SIL> i'm not the monday tuesday wednesday thursday type <SIL> but i am pretty involved <SIL> i'm pretty involved <SIL> um-hum <SIL> the community <SIL> the community <SIL> um the church is designed as a community of other christians <SIL> it's not necessarily designed as <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i heard this in a sermon this is really good <SIL> um it's not designed as the congregation comes in and says way to go pastor you go do it we're gonna cheer you on <SIL> the job of a christian is to go out and spread the gospel of jesus christ <SIL> that's the job <SIL> of a christian <SIL> and <SIL> there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten <SIL> that that's what the original <VOCNOISE> yknow that's what the that's what a christian's supposed to do <SIL> and that's what our church does <SIL> 
<SIL> we try and <VOCNOISE> yknow we try and <SIL> and teach and <SIL> expand people's knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about christ <SIL> they don't have <SIL> yknow they don't have that blank look on their face when the person asks them something <SIL> yknow they <SIL> somebody asks them something and they're like yknow <SIL> i don't know <SIL> or they <SIL> actually have an answer <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=if> <SIL> if <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=if> <SIL> and if they don't know they'll say <SIL> i don't know but i can find out for you if you're willing to <SIL> if you're willing to give me the time to go find out <SIL> i don't know the hardest <IVER>

<SIL> yeah <SIL> it was because i got <SIL> it was because i got into a different <SIL> i mean <SIL> i had grown up <SIL> with these people <SIL> yknow i hung out with all these people that were part of my youth group and <SIL> and i hung out with them and hung out with them and <SIL> and <SIL> i came to columbus and met a whole new group of people <SIL> mean every year i've been down here i've met another <SIL> yknow <SIL> thousand people <SIL> and they're all different <SIL> every year they're <SIL> all different people <SIL> and that didn't happen back home i keep meeting people and it's just really fascinating <SIL> yeah <SIL> this is <SIL> endless flow of people and you're like wow <SIL> and man there get some weird looking people down here <SIL> man there's some good looking chicks down here in columbus <SIL> let me tell you <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> um yeah my freshman year i went out with uh someone her name was <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> she <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she's the one who really got me into the uh <SIL> what we call charismatic <SIL> um <SIL> christianity <SIL> the christianity uh <SIL> yknow like <SIL> the opposite of charismatic <SIL> is <SIL> the um the serious <SIL> old time protestant church <SIL> where they put numbers up on the wall and you open up your hymnal to those numbers you sing <SIL> you stand up when everyone tells you stand up you sit down when everyone tells you to sit down <SIL> yadda yadda <SIL> and then <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> protestant <SIL> the uh sorry the um <SIL> charismatic is the exact opposite of that <SIL> when you think of charismatic you think of the black churches <SIL> where there's <SIL> all sorts of <SIL> organ playing and <SIL> yknow praise the <EXCLUDE-praise_the_Lord> and hands in the air and singing and dancing and <SIL> people falling over and <SIL> and she's she really introduced me to that <SIL> um <SIL> and then we dated for about three months <SIL> and <SIL> i <SIL> both of us decided okay <SIL> this is <SIL> we accomplished what we <VOCNOISE> were supposed to accomplish in this relationship you've introduced me to something and i've introduced you to something and <SIL> now we're gonna go our separate ways and so <VOCNOISE> we separated <SIL> and then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i found my current church <SIL> and <SIL> got plugged in there and i met someone there <SIL> um <SIL> in <SIL> january <SIL> of this year <SIL> we dated for two months <SIL> and then <SIL> i got really tired of the fact that within two weeks of knowing me and dating me she said <SIL> <EXCLUDE-oh> william you're the person i'm gonna marry <SIL> and that <IVER>
flipped me out <IVER>
<SIL> that flipped me out man <SIL> i couldn't handle that that <SIL> i'm not ready for that i mean that was crazy she was twenty three first person i've ever dated that's older than me <SIL> and uh that was just frightening i mean she was like <SIL> dead serious she was a hundred percent sure <SIL> i was the person she was going to marry <SIL> and i'll see her at church every so often and she'll come up and give me a big hug she's like i miss you <SIL> i'm like <SIL> well i miss you too not probably the way you miss me but i miss <SIL> i miss you yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um yeah if she's a <ERROR-nunatic> no <LAUGH> no no no no no i mean she's a <CUTOFF-g=great> she's a great person she's a good christian but there's some things about her that i would not want in a wife <LAUGH> <SIL> ixnay on that <SIL> but um <SIL> i've been single since <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> probably <SIL> march <SIL> and i'm probably gonna stay that way for a while mainly because i don't like anybody nobody likes me i like it that way <SIL> i don't <IVER>
i don't have money and <SIL> when i start dating people i have <ERROR-expre=extremely> <SIL> i have extremely expensive tastes <VOCNOISE> for women <SIL> and <SIL> i like wine and dining people <VOCNOISE> i love the opera <SIL> and that gets real <EXCLUDE-expensive_after> a while <SIL> gets real expensive after a while <SIL> uh i'm taking one class <SIL> i'm taking uh an accounting class <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> i had a real big mess <SIL> academically <SIL> um <SIL> graduated high school with three five it was all college prep classes a p courses <SIL> i got a really high i q extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coasting on that intellect <SIL> i'd go in take an exam <SIL> bing bang <SIL> go out get an a <SIL> wouldn't even study for it i think i studied as much my senior year as i did my <SIL> freshman year for one midterm <LAUGH> or <LAUGH> or one final <SIL> and uh that just didn't work when i got to college <SIL> but i didn't know that until i was done with my freshman year with a one point seven g p a <SIL> about uh <SIL> about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-whe=when> see the middle of winter quarter i realized why <SIL> i was in engineering <SIL> i had applied <EXCLUDE-to> <SIL> three colleges <SIL> my senior year of high school <SIL> ohio state <SIL> on a whim from my dad who told me to apply there because <SIL> i could get in <SIL> without any trouble whatsoever <SIL> naval academy and the air force academy <SIL> now <SIL> naval academy air force academy and west point <SIL> are three of the top <CUTOFF-har=hardest> <SIL> ten hardest schools in the world to get into <SIL> you get into one of those academies and you're coming out as an engineer <SIL> that's what they all are <SIL> i mean yeah there's other <SIL> there's other field but the vast majority are engineers <SIL> i like math and science <SIL> so i figure oh <SIL> engineering i don't have any other options i must be engineering <SIL> so i came to college and i got into the <SIL> honors engineering <SIL> freshman freshman <ERROR-honginineer=honors_engineer> <SIL> honors <SIL> engineering program <SIL> called the gateway program <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> engineering <SIL> is the <SIL> hardest <SIL> field <SIL> to study <SIL> aside probably from law or medicine <SIL> and <SIL> i went into the <SIL> honors program <SIL> that was a big mistake <SIL> really really big mistake i got to college and it just went downhill <SIL> i had all that freedom and <SIL> i had no clue how to study <SIL> and it just went to hell in a hand basket <SIL> summer <SIL> um <CUTOFF-s=summer?> spring quarter <SIL> i switched my major to music <SIL> because i'm extremely musically inclined it's one of the gifts that i've gotten <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that uh <SIL> that i discovered is very similar to acting which i love to do but i realized that just like acting <SIL> you <SIL> are <SIL> all good <SIL> ninety five percent of you are poor as dirt <SIL> three percent of you <SIL> are right in the middle and two percent of you are extremely wealthy <SIL> and the vast majority like i said ninety five percent are dirt poor yknow i don't want to do that <SIL> i mean i <SIL> i my dad's a doctor i was raised in high society i don't want to leave high society <VOCNOISE> i like it there <LAUGH> <SIL> i like it there a lot <SIL> yeah <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i was like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i better get out of <VOCNOISE> better get out of the music thing <SIL> so i decided to go into business <SIL> but um <SIL> i can't get into business <SIL> until <SIL> i get a <ERROR-punch=bunch> a bunch prerequisite courses <VOCNOISE> out of the way because my g p a is <CUTOFF-on=only> <SIL> it's <SIL> i <SIL> in <SIL> after <CUTOFF-l=last?> <SIL> this quarter i did really good this quarter <SIL> after this quarter it's up to a two two <SIL> and <SIL> i'm not gonna be able to <SIL> get into the business school until i've got a bunch prerequisites out of the way <SIL> and they're sequences <SIL> i can't take accounting two twelve until i'm done with two eleven i can't take <SIL> c i s two hundred and two o one until i'm done with two hundred <SIL> and all that <SIL> junk so <SIL> i had to take this stupid class this summer because <SIL> if i'm gonna get in when i want to <SIL> um <SIL> i have <SIL> yknow i hafta take it this summer <SIL> i hate taking classes in summer <SIL> when i'm <SIL> well because <SIL> i'd rather just <SIL> i'd rather just <SIL> work <SIL> and and not worry about the classes and then have all sorts of fun all summer long with all my friends <SIL> but it's not gonna work <SIL> yeah <SIL> rest my brain a little bit <SIL> but i'm still searching for a job <SIL> it's not that i can't find jobs it's just that i can't find the one i want <SIL> i mean the job market is huge down here in columbus <SIL> i mean i want a job right around nine ten dollars an hour <SIL> so i can get a full forty hour week <SIL> and they won't have a problem with me leaving at five o'clock because i have a class at five thirty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but that's what i'm doing this summer <SIL> i'm still searching for a job <SIL> i would've <SIL> i would've done some more searching today but i've had a few problems with my satanic computer <SIL> stupid <IVER>
<SIL> i swear it's possessed <SIL> i <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> if i could figure out how to work <SIL> f disk <SIL> and format <SIL> in dos <SIL> i might be able to figure out what my problem is <SIL> because i've started running two <SIL> i started running windows two thousand <SIL> about three months ago <SIL> that was a dumb mistake <SIL> one of the guys in my house is software <ERROR-prirate=pirate> <SIL> and he got me a copy of two thousand he was like <SIL> <EXCLUDE-dude> your computer will run two thousand let's put it on your computer so i was <IVER>
<SIL> i was like <SIL> okay <SIL> alright what are the advantages and he's like dude let's just put on your computer so i'm like alright fine <SIL> i don't care <SIL> so we put it on my computer and i've had nothing but problems since <SIL> i don't know how anyone can run two thousand if they don't know what they're doing i'm trying to find drivers <SIL> because i've had to find <SIL> i've had to find <SIL> drivers for everything <SIL> i mean they don't <UNKNOWN> <SIL> oh yeah <SIL> and also it's <VOCNOISE> directed towards businesses <SIL> it's <SIL> n t technology which is <SIL> <ERROR-divisigned=divised_designed> for network businesses and <SIL> well anyways <SIL> it's got a different file structure format than windows ninety <SIL> eight <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> it runs <SIL> it runs on <SIL> n t s f <SIL> and fat thirty two <SIL> and <SIL> i hafta switch it back <SIL> to fat sixteen <SIL> and <SIL> i can't get the partitioning right <SIL> for my <CUTOFF-d=drive> <SIL> for my drive because fat sixteen can't handle anything above two gigs for the primary drive <SIL> and my drive is ten gig drive so i hafta partition it <SIL> and i can't figure out how to get silly thing partitioned <SIL> because every time i try and work around it and make partition through f disk <SIL> i get these really wacky <SIL> errors <SIL> everything gets transferred over to d drive and i have no more c drive <SIL> it's gone <LAUGH> <SIL> i don't know where it vanishes to <SIL> so <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it> it is <SIL> no and i can't do a stinking thing on my computer <SIL> i hafta use all the other guys' computers in my house 
<SIL> yeah <NOISE> <SIL> true <SIL> yes <SIL> um no actually my roommate's in colorado right now <SIL> and he's going to he's <SIL> he's gonna be there <IVER>
he's gonna <SIL> he's gonna be there all summer <SIL> yknow i didn't decide i wanted to change it over until i got my scanner <SIL> um <SIL> and found out that when i checked the web site <SIL> for the scanner <SIL> that <SIL> they're just simply flat out not making <SIL> windows two thousand drivers for my scanner <SIL> so <SIL> it's a um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> crap <SIL> i don't know <SIL> i just got it <VOCNOISE> i can't even remember what it is <SIL> um <SIL> paper port <SIL> i think it's paper port <SIL> avoid windows two thousand at all costs <SIL> stick with ninety eight <SIL> much better <SIL> much better operating system <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> that's a good system <SIL> it's really fascinating too because i called microsoft <SIL> and it was gonna cost me thirty five dollars for technical support <SIL> i was like screw that <SIL> i was like screw that dude <IVER>
figure out how to do it myself <SIL> so i got on some my news groups and i'm like guys can you help me <SIL> oh no it's not that i hate microsoft it's yknow i mean <SIL> they hafta do what they hafta do <SIL> i mean <SIL> people <CUTOFF-d=don't> <SIL> people don't understand that software hasta stay <SIL> up to date <SIL> on the minute <SIL> or they get sucked under <SIL> mean there are <VOCNOISE> there are operating systems that people haven't even heard of <SIL> that were the <SIL> thing <SIL> in their days <SIL> i mean <SIL> a lot of people know what a commodore sixty four is <SIL> they've heard of it <SIL> but <SIL> they really don't know <SIL> what a brilliant system it was at it's uh in in it's <SIL> initial stage <SIL> and <SIL> it just got bowled over because <SIL> yknow something better came out <SIL> something better will come out than windows <SIL> microsoft will eventually go under <SIL> it's just gonna take a while <SIL> uh yeah <SIL> oh yeah i don't <SIL> i give it probably about six or seven years before <SIL> for before somebody comes out with a system that's just as good as microsoft <SIL> linux uh i don't know <SIL> i think linux will be around forever <SIL> just because it's such a stable system that's so good <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> yeah <SIL> and macintosh will stay around forever just because macintosh is invincible <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> after the big hype of the i mac and it didn't do as good as it nearly as good as they thought it was gonna do <SIL> even if did okay it's still around <SIL> it just didn't do as

<SIL> it's so dirty i wish they'd clean it up more <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> when i first started working for the courier service <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i really really hated one way streets <SIL> but once you get the hang of it <SIL> they're a blessing <SIL> because you're in downtown and all of a sudden ding ding ding ding ding ding ding you see like twelve green lights in a row <SIL> you're just like <SIL> you go as fast as you can and try and get through <SIL> all of them all at the same time <SIL> now mind you if you're doing that anytime during the day that won't happen because you've got cars all around you but at night it's pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the middle of down town <SIL> um <SIL> improvements <SIL> i would just say keep i would just say that man this place is dirty <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i wish they'd clean it up more often <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no <SIL> it's not sprawling out from where i am <LAUGH> <SIL> i don't live in the suburbia <SIL> area so <SIL> i mean i live <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i live right in the middle of all the <SIL> houses that have been there for sixty or seventy years and i'm smack dab in the middle of all the frats and sororities on campus <SIL> so <SIL> i'm on <SIL> nah <SIL> that's fine <SIL> spreads out fine <SIL> i just think it's funny <SIL> i <SIL> i'd love to get a good nice <SIL> overhead view of columbus because you probably see the <SIL> house after house after house um <SIL> yknow like <SIL> they did right in the right in the <SIL> um fifties <SIL> uh i can't remember what it's called <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like where <SIL> every single house is a mirror image of the one right beside it <SIL> and you get all these streets that are in the exact same pattern all yknow like for like miles and miles and miles <SIL> but um <SIL> no <SIL> i think it's cool that they're all spreading out <SIL> oh yeah one thing they could really do with columbus that i've noticed <SIL> are <SIL> i would say lack of noticed in any other city in the united states <SIL> why in the world do they hafta work on <SIL> all the roads <SIL> all at the same time <SIL> i don't understand <SIL> they hafta to they're working on three fifteen two seventy seventy seventy one six seventy <SIL> all at the same time <SIL> why <SIL> <VOCNOISE> why <SIL> i don't understand it <SIL> yeah <SIL> apparently not <VOCNOISE> not really <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> 
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah as i was teasing <LAUGH-hm> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
twenty eight years <SIL> this is my twenty eighth year <VOCNOISE> i have two more years to go <SIL> and i get to <EXT-retire> <VOCNOISE> and then i'll go <SIL> retrain and probably do something else for another twenty years <IVER>
oh no <SIL> no they move you around all the time when you <ERROR-terch=teach> when you teach kids with learning disabilities <VOCNOISE> they move you to where the population is <SIL> rather than move the kids to you <SIL> so yeah i've been in <VOCNOISE> columbus <SIL> and worthington are the two systems i've been in but <SIL> no though within those <NOISE-systems> they can move you around from school to school <SIL> i've been at the same one now for <SIL> this is my seventh year <SIL> at the middle school <IVER>
it's grace brethren christian middle school it's part of worthington schools cause they annexed <SIL> it <IVER>
i was in columbus for the first like six years i taught <IVER>
back in the <CUTOFF-s=seventies> <SIL> early seventies <SIL> and then i transferred to worthington in seventy six and i've been there ever since <IVER>
<SIL> no i didn't really start out as <SIL> a teacher i started out as a speech and hearing therapist <VOCNOISE> but they kept giving me these kids that <SIL> i couldn't keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them <SIL> so i got interested in the hyper activity and so i started taking classes <VOCNOISE> about any <SIL> kids with <SIL> a d h d and stuff and <VOCNOISE> little by little first thing you know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i had my masters in learning disabilities <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was mostly just so i could <SIL> learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy and then when i found out there were so many openings in special ed <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for l d because <SIL> a lot of these l d kids have language deficits and language problems they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they can't yknow like express themselves on paper <SIL> or they don't <SIL> <CUTOFF-he=hear> <SIL> process things correctly <SIL> auditorially so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's the perfect background <SIL> to work with l d kids <SIL> i didn't know i was doing that at the time but <NOISE> <IVER>
somebody must have been watching over me <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah right i taught <SIL> um <SIL> well i was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever since that i've <SIL> been in <IVER>
uh-huh <SIL> and then when i got my masters <VOCNOISE> no i did it <NOISE> no i did it <VOCNOISE> during <NOISE-um> <NOISE> the weekends <NOISE-and> <NOISE-the> summers <NOISE> and the nights <NOISE> and took me about <SIL> mm <SIL> well i started teaching in nineteen seventy <SIL> seventy one <IVER>
and then <CUTOFF-I=I> i <SIL> got my masters in seventy five <SIL> so it took me four years that way <SIL> no i never <VOCNOISE> i just <CUTOFF-w=was> <SIL> was smart enough to do it before i had kids <IVER>
well i was married but i didn't have any kids once <ERROR-you're=you> have kids <ERROR-you=you're> not gonna be able to do that kind of a schedule <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> yeah so i didn't take off any time <SIL> and then when i <SIL> got my masters i ran into an old friend of mine <VOCNOISE> who <SIL> teaches in worthington and he <VOCNOISE> <SIL> said oh i'm the special ed director up there now we need a resource room <NOISE-teacher> why don't you come up and interview for this position <SIL> or that position or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i went up and interviewed for that position got another position but anyway it all worked <LAUGH-out> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i guess i'd have to say <SIL> i <SIL> don't necessarily like middle school <VOCNOISE> but see when you get a special ed certificate you're certified kindergarten through twelfth <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i did <SIL> several years in a high school <SIL> when i was first out of college <SIL> i did high school first <SIL> then i went to elementary while <SIL> my kids were in elementary <SIL> so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then <SIL> six years ago i went to the middle school <SIL> and i've decided that <SIL> i'm too old <SIL> to keep up with these kids <SIL> not only are they <SIL> learning disability and a d d but they're middle schoolers <SIL> and they have like hormones running rampant all over the outside of their bodies <SIL> you can't tell which is the hormones and which is the a d d and which is the learning disability <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> like i said i only have two more years to go so i guess i can live through <NOISE-that> <IVER>
that's not my favorite age i guess <IVER>
middle <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
oh yeah they were more settled <IVER>
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade and eleventh they're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they're gonna have to go to college and <VOCNOISE> this is like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the only life they're gonna get yknow they kind of get that realization they start getting serious <VOCNOISE> kids at middle school think everything's just a big joke yknow i'm gonna play in a rock band <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they all think they're gonna be rock stars and drummers and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> yknow they could care less <SIL> about anything it hasn't hit them yet this is my real life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> duh <SIL> this is my one real life <SIL> better not throw it away <VOCNOISE> they waste time yknow <VOCNOISE> they <NOISE-lose> stuff <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it's just middle school i think it's <VOCNOISE> transitioning from childhood <VOCNOISE> to adulthood is a tough time <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> when you have all the other <SIL> things going on like you can't read and you can't write and you can't spell <VOCNOISE> then it's just even worse <ERROR-ik's=it's> <CUTOFF-ek=exacerbated> it's exacerbated even more <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and they <CUTOFF-g=go> <IVER>
oh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't really <LAUGH-think> so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i guess i don't <SIL> i guess i don't <SIL> i don't get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yell and scream at them <CUTOFF-a=and> i mean realize they didn't ask to have a learning disability <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean they and that they can't <SIL> they're not some teachers think they're just being belligerent <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that if they wanted to straighten up they could <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and what i try to tell those teachers is they can't change their learning disability anymore than you can change your brown eyes <SIL> yknow they were born with it it's genetic someone else in their family has it <VOCNOISE> they can learn they just don't learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or teach it a different way it's like teaching a math problem two different ways you get the same answer <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> one way works better for you <SIL> well that's how they are <SIL> yknow maybe they don't learn well by listening <VOCNOISE> <SIL> maybe they don't learn by <CUTOFF-b=by?> well by looking <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ae=at> <SIL> at a chart or something <SIL> maybe they only learn well when they're up moving around doing something <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow you just have to understand that their <VOCNOISE> avenues of learning are like different than yours <SIL> and totally <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some of them <SIL> might be totally screwed up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like they might hear <SIL> half of what you say <SIL> or they might jumble up what you say you say <CUTOFF-p=page?> <SIL> turn to page three ninety three or <VOCNOISE> and they turn to three thirty nine in their book <SIL> yknow and they think they did what you said <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just like something's mixed up between <VOCNOISE> the actual eye and the ear <SIL> and then it where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> for one day in their shoes <SIL> you'd probably have a lot of empathy for them <IVER>
well <IVER>
<CUTOFF-n=no?> actually in order to get in my room you have to <VOCNOISE> be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify as a learning disability kid <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in other <CUTOFF-word=words> <SIL> the way you qualify in the state of <NOISE-Ohio> is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you have a thirty point discrepancy between your actual i q <SIL> and your daily performance in other words <VOCNOISE> <SIL> let's say you have a hundred i q <SIL> but in all of your classes you're performing like a seventy i q person would <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so if there's a thirty point discrepancy in there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ae=and> and <SIL> people see that you're bright <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=and> but yet you're just not <SIL> getting it <VOCNOISE> you're not able to write answers <SIL> like you could say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or you're not able to read things <SIL> that other seventh graders can read <VOCNOISE> that kind of clues us in and then the <SIL> regular ed or somebody refers the child for testing <SIL> and then if they qualify <SIL> for help <SIL> then we <VOCNOISE> yknow they go to my room for certain classes most of my kids i have them for reading and english <IVER>
that's not a shocking surprise <SIL> i mean i rarely get a kid for math although we do have kids that are <SIL> learning disabled and they don't understand math either even though it's very concrete <IVER>
<IVER>
no <CUTOFF-m=math> <CUTOFF-m=math> math is just <SIL> you can say okay here's three blocks you can touch them <SIL> one <SIL> two three take two away now there's one <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah you can't say a noun is always gonna be orange <VOCNOISE> and it's gonna be slippery <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow> <LAUGH-what> <LAUGH-I> <LAUGH-mean> <SIL> language is so much more abstract than math and science <VOCNOISE> so the abstract areas like history and <SIL> english and reading and literature that's where these kids have their problems <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because their <SIL> disability is usually rooted in <SIL> somewhere in the languages <VOCNOISE> they either can't write can't read can't spell <SIL> can't do all three <SIL> or aren't very good at any of them <SIL> once in a while you'll see a good speller <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because he can remember the order in which the letters come <SIL> but <SIL> he might be a horrible reader and a horrible <SIL> writer even though he can spell <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah and his comprehension <SIL> of the words of other kids his age wouldn't be <SIL> what it should be <VOCNOISE> generally speaking my kids are two to four years behind 
<SIL> and socially too <SIL> i mean mostly a d h <SIL> d and l d kids are emotionally immature as well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so like the songs that their friends are listening to <SIL> and their friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they're still <SIL> acting like a fifth grader <VOCNOISE> yknow their not interested in girls and they're still listening to music that younger kids would like <VOCNOISE> they're just <SIL> generally <SIL> they mature a little slower <SIL> takes them longer to catch up <IVER>
attention deficit hyperactive disorder <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well <IVER>
actually <SIL> you can have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well they <CUTOFF-m=mainly?> usually go together some kids have learning disabilities without the <SIL> a d h d and some have <SIL> a d h d without the learning disability <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and some have both <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you can have a d <SIL> d without having the hyperactive part <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you can have <SIL> attention deficit disorder <VOCNOISE> with what they call hypo activity <VOCNOISE> and that's the student <VOCNOISE> that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they never cause any trouble <VOCNOISE> but they're kind of like out of touch with reality and they are always looking out the window <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and like they're the one that says i didn't hear what what was the question <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <SIL> they're <SIL> they're a d d and they can't quite focus and <CUTOFF-sh=?> distract <SIL> <CUTOFF-ne=?> they can't screen out the distractions but <VOCNOISE> because they're not hyper they're not always doing this and they're not bothering people <VOCNOISE> they're kind of the <VOCNOISE> they're the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle <SIL> those are the kids that are real cooperative and they're always smiling they're kind of spaced out and daydreaming and <SIL> and takes a long time to realize <SIL> hey this kid <SIL> can't focus <VOCNOISE> but with the kid that's all over the place and doing a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> tapping this kids chair and the kid goes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> make him stop tapping my chair <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-yi=you> you can see right away that he can't focus because when you're he asks you for help and you come over to explain something to him and he's like <SIL> all over the place while you're explaining he's not listening <NOISE-you're> trying to show him something he won't look at it <VOCNOISE> yknow it's like <SIL> people often say <SIL> a d d kids <SIL> can't focus <SIL> or can't <SIL> attend to anything <SIL> but what's really happening <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is they attend to everything <IVER>
they can <IVER>
they just can't <SIL> single out <SIL> what i should attend to and what i should screen out <VOCNOISE> so they attend to everything <ERROR-we=equally> equally <VOCNOISE> the train going by out here the teacher talking up here <VOCNOISE> the kid over here shuffling his papers <VOCNOISE> this kid back <NOISE-here> <NOISE-picking> up his pencil <VOCNOISE> and so <SIL> they get a little bit of everything and they don't learn anything <IVER>
<SIL> you see <SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
or um <IVER>
if you read it <SIL> to yourself out loud <SIL> like if you're in a room by yourself and you read out loud do you remember it better <SIL> than if you read <NOISE-it> silently <SIL> if you hear yourself say the words <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well you have to um <SIL> try some different things like put on headphones with music that doesn't have any words <SIL> and try to read somewhere like <IVER>
yeah <SIL> that blocks out <SIL> all that uh <CUTOFF-s=sound?> <VOCNOISE> extraneous stuff that's trying to pull you away <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah and you don't want to listen to any <CUTOFF-m=music> music with words because then you'll start singing in the words and then you won't be able to read <IVER>
now how can you do that <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
and i have kids that say i do better when i listen to my music honest i do misses <EXCLUDE-name> please let me listen to my headphones <VOCNOISE> but then they can't hear you when you say okay the time's up stop now or whatever <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're going <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> poke him <LAUGH> so i don't usually let the kids listen to their headphones oh maybe the last week of school in june or something but <VOCNOISE> or maybe right around christmas time but most of the time i don't <VOCNOISE> because they get <SIL> too <SIL> out of touch with everything that's going on in the room <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i don't have a like a regular size class like i'll have five six seven kids at a time and believe me when you got seven hyper active <IVER>
<IVER>
in your room <VOCNOISE> it's just like forty of any other kind it's plenty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh there always has been <VOCNOISE> there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a lot of kids are on medication today that shouldn't be <SIL> but um <SIL> i think that's the fault of the school or the parents <VOCNOISE> or some doctor that like for example when we <ERROR-frefer=refer> kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with <VOCNOISE> and we know that they won't just give this kid a pill if he doesn't have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> eight out of the twelve symptoms or whatever <SIL> so we refer them to those doctors and then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if <SIL> this <CUTOFF-do=doctor> <VOCNOISE> those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it's usually just for the school day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not during the summer not over vacation not after five o'clock <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not on the weekends <VOCNOISE> and it's just to help them focus <SIL> and then <SIL> these doctors also ask for <VOCNOISE> reports back from the teachers and if you don't see any appreciable difference <VOCNOISE> in two or three weeks then you take the kid off and you try something else <VOCNOISE> and some kids medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in observe the kid you can't believe it's the same kid <VOCNOISE> other kids <SIL> doesn't phase them they might as well be drinking a glass of water <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> since they have side effects like they stunt your growth and they <VOCNOISE> subdue your appetite and some of the other <SIL> yknow some kids get headaches from dexadrine and aderal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i say yknow if it works use it if it <SIL> if it doesn't work just forget it <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> yknow a lot of <SIL> people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there may be just <SIL> not able to pay attention a little bit but they're not really a d d <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the parents are taking them in and going <VOCNOISE> johnnie's not getting straight a's put him on something <LAUGH> <LAUGH> so <SIL> i guess <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <CUTOFF-an=and> <IVER>
i think <VOCNOISE> it's really <SIL> you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on <VOCNOISE> and how long they stay on it <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and most kids don't like being on medication <VOCNOISE> because it makes them different <VOCNOISE> they don't look at it like <SIL> gee i'm really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate <VOCNOISE> they look it like <VOCNOISE> well none of my friends have to do it so why do i have to do it <VOCNOISE> yknow <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> they look at it like it's a big pain because they gotta run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> generally <SIL> the long acting they're time released ones there's only a couple of them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release <VOCNOISE> and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time release <VOCNOISE> and it wears off and it doesn't <SIL> do what it's supposed to so they go back to <VOCNOISE> the six hour <SIL> dosage yknow one in the morning one at lunch <VOCNOISE> and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they're late to the lunch line and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they just hate it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but it isn't something they can <VOCNOISE> a lot of kids <SIL> will not <SIL> i guess they're in <SIL> denial just like <SIL> we would be <SIL> they say <SIL> it doesn't help me i don't need it <VOCNOISE> but when you sit down and say okay <VOCNOISE> what are the things you're able to do when you're on it <SIL> <SIL> that you really have trouble with when you're off of it and they see it in black and white they go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh yeah <IVER>
<SIL> i did get better grades last nine weeks didn't i <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> wow isn't that amazing you were taking your pills then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some connection here <LAUGH> so you kind of just have to sit them down and and say well let's just go through some of the things that <VOCNOISE> give you trouble and we'll write them down and say <SIL> oh well last nine weeks you did that without any problem at all <SIL> <VOCNOISE> this nine weeks <VOCNOISE> you haven't been able to focus on that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> maybe <VOCNOISE-the-medicine> does help you some <SIL> maybe you just <SIL> yknow not giving it credit <IVER>
by the eighth grade they are <SIL> sixth and seventh graders pretty much know everything <SIL> and you're the stupid one <SIL> but by the time they get to eighth grade they're going <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh you're the best teacher i can't believe i said that to you <LAUGH> <IVER>
or they <SIL> yeah <SIL> they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school <IVER>
three years <SIL> i have them <VOCNOISE> usually i have them sixth seventh and eighth <SIL> for those <SIL> language arts subjects <SIL> unless they get <SIL> some miraculous cure <SIL> and they get <SIL> phased out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like right now i'm phasing a kid an eighth grader out and into the regular english <VOCNOISE> but he worked really really hard <SIL> and he's very bright <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he's still a terrible speller <SIL> but <SIL> he <SIL> is not lazy <SIL> and he does his assignments <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and as long as you clearly <SIL> explain to him what he's supposed to do and he's a good writer <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <CUTOFF-r=?> usually when he misspells something you can figure out what it says from the context <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow so we're in the process of phasing him out <SIL> so that he won't have to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's had help <SIL> i think since he was in kindergarten <SIL> that's the other thing that's really an enigma about these kids <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ninety percent of the time their i q is like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i mean they're very bright <SIL> but yet <SIL> something <SIL> isn't <SIL> <IVER>
connecting <SIL> some wires are crossed up here or something <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they're <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=and?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=and?> so they become very distrustful of adults because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all their life people've been saying <SIL> 
<SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> you're really smart <SIL> no you're not dumb <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but they sit in class and they see their friends just catch on to things <VOCNOISE> and that they can't do <VOCNOISE> and so then they say <VOCNOISE> well my parents are just saying that because they love me <SIL> i'm really stupid <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> and you have to actually ow them when they get to be this age that <VOCNOISE> look you have a hundred and seventeen i q <IVER>
so that m means you're a good problem solver you're a good logical <VOCNOISE> thinker <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you're good in science you're good at math <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> so there's a few things you're not good at <SIL> doesn't mean you're stupid <SIL> yknow <SIL> i'd much rather be stranded on an island with six <SIL> <IVER>
l d kids than <IVER>
<IVER>
with six normal kids <VOCNOISE> because l d kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there <VOCNOISE> and the normal kids would sit and cry <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
oh yes they are <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> generally <SIL> they have some area <VOCNOISE> i don't think i've ever met the kid <SIL> yet the <NOISE-special> kid <SIL> who <SIL> has no <SIL> area <SIL> that he doesn't excel in like <SIL> once i had a <VOCNOISE> sixth grade girl who <SIL> still didn't know her time tables in sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice <VOCNOISE> and in every single school production she was the lead singer <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i had a girl once that won all kind of medals in gymnastics at the state level <VOCNOISE> it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back i've had kids who they <VOCNOISE> got every badge you can get in boy scouts and <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean there's usually something that they're <VOCNOISE> really <SIL> it might not be related to school <VOCNOISE> but there's usually something that they're really really good at in some other area <VOCNOISE> like there's <VOCNOISE> swimming or <VOCNOISE> or scouting or whatever so <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> but generally speaking they will attack a problem <VOCNOISE> a totally different way than the norm <VOCNOISE> and they will come up with <SIL> much more creative solutions <SIL> than the normal <VOCNOISE> person with a hundred <VOCNOISE> or ninety five i q <SIL> now i've seen them long <NOISE-enough> to know that <VOCNOISE> and worked with them long enough to know that <VOCNOISE> well like i have one boy who can't spell them he still spells it t h i m <VOCNOISE> and he took my computer apart the other day and <VOCNOISE> adjusted something in the mother board and put it back together now it works <IVER>
<SIL> now i mean <VOCNOISE> if you saw his writing you'd think a cave man wrote it <VOCNOISE> it looks like <SIL> hieroglyphics or something <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i want something done with my printers or my computers i just go hey jared <SIL> i'm having trouble with this printer <VOCNOISE> takes it all apart <SIL> fixes it i mean <VOCNOISE> he's <LAUGH-really> really <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
well <SIL> that's the other thing they're a lot of times they're good in the arts <VOCNOISE> they're either <SIL> an artist i've a boy right now that's an eighth grader that's painting <VOCNOISE> a huge canvas for me <SIL> for my living room <VOCNOISE> because i haven't been able to find a picture so i brought in the picture <VOCNOISE> and he's <VOCNOISE> enlarging it and painting it for me <VOCNOISE> in his free time and <SIL> it's gonna go in my living room <SIL> and i mean it's <VOCNOISE> it's <CUTOFF-me=mean> i mean he's really quite the artist <VOCNOISE> in <VOCNOISE> music <VOCNOISE> arts <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> literature acting i've had kids that've been like <VOCNOISE> really <SIL> top notch actors in the school plays <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it's> <SIL> it's just <SIL> not necessarily <SIL> a school kind of thing that they're gonna be good at <SIL> but i try to explain to the parents that <SIL> just because your child learns differently <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is <SIL> no reason to think they won't be successful in life <VOCNOISE> mark spitz <SIL> won an olympic gold medal <VOCNOISE> he has a learning disability <SIL> cher bono can't remember a phone number without transposing two of the numbers <VOCNOISE> and she says that herself <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> einstein didn't learn to read until he was twelve <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> winston churchill <VOCNOISE> he stuttered until he was like seven or eight <VOCNOISE> uh walt disney was told by a manager at woolworth's that he would never have a creative idea in his life <IVER>
and fired him <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> beethoven <SIL> i think it <SIL> was beethoven that didn't talk <SIL> till he was like seven <VOCNOISE> they thought he was retarded <VOCNOISE> but you see these people just <SIL> they're brain's wired differently than ours is and <VOCNOISE> you just <SIL> you can't ever expect them <SIL> to approach any <SIL> problem like you would <VOCNOISE> because they won't <SIL> it just doesn't seem logical to them <VOCNOISE> they're usually real good at puzzles <SIL> they're usually real good at <SIL> yknow <SIL> things that <VOCNOISE> manipulatives <SIL> things that don't take words <SIL> things that you just hafta solve <SIL> by just manipulating things around <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
some of them are pretty good at that some of them aren't too <SIL> <LAUGH> some of them like when you have them copy uh like <VOCNOISE> up <SIL> from this box down to this box these little shapes <SIL> in a certain amount of time <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if their visual perception is messed up <SIL> they screw that all up <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> yknow the form goes this way they draw it this way <SIL> their brain flips it around on them <VOCNOISE> that's why they have trouble with n's and u's <VOCNOISE> and b's and d's <SIL> and they're still reversing <NOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> you <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ma=my?> normal kids that goes away about age eight <VOCNOISE> my kids they're still doing it <SIL> yknow they're still <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ma=make> or they might make an eight from the bottom up <SIL> instead of from the top down or a six from the bottom up <VOCNOISE> i even had a kid once that made ones from the bottom up <VOCNOISE> you could tell by watching them write that their brain didn't work like yours did <IVER>
well that <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-y=you?> <IVER>
well usually normal kids <IVER>
that's <VOCNOISE> that's yeah it's <SIL> developmental <VOCNOISE> because by the <SIL> did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school <VOCNOISE> it's <ERROR-becuth=because_that's> <ERROR-sat's=because_that's> when <VOCNOISE> some <SIL> expert <SIL> thought <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> one hemisphere or the other <VOCNOISE> was <SIL> dominant <SIL> but now they found out that the full dominance doesn't take over till about age eight <IVER>
you have a preference at five or six <VOCNOISE> but by the time you turn eight <VOCNOISE> one of your hemispheres is pretty much decided it's gonna be the one that runs the show <VOCNOISE> well then <VOCNOISE> that's when <SIL> those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture <SIL> so <SIL> hm <IVER>
oh <IVER>
no <SIL> i thought my son <IVER>
the one that's eighteen now <SIL> i thought he was gonna be left handed up <NOISE-until> <NOISE-he> <NOISE-was> like four <VOCNOISE> because his dad's left handed my sister's left handed <SIL> i have one left handed parent <VOCNOISE> well all of sudden one day he picked up the thing with the right hand and he's been <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-wri=writing?> with his right hand ever since <VOCNOISE> so you really can't tell <SIL> because they <SIL> they're pretty much <SIL> either or until they're about five <IVER>
and you don't have to worry if she writes her name backwards like a mirror image <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> because that'll all go away about second grade <IVER>
oh good <IVER>
i always hate it when people name their kids <VOCNOISE> jamilia kenisha <SIL> and i'm like <IVER>
oh boy <VOCNOISE> is this <SIL> kindergarten teacher gonna have fun with this <IVER>
little girl <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> i always think you should name a kid <SIL> i have opinions about everything see <VOCNOISE> i think you should name a kid <VOCNOISE> something that will fit him at eighty three <SIL> and eight <SIL> and in between <SIL> like we named our son robert <VOCNOISE> so when he was little he was robbie <SIL> now he's eighteen he's rob <VOCNOISE> when he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do he can be robert <SIL> paul <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> in kindergarten all he had to learn to write was <SIL> r o b <SIL> or r o b b y <SIL> so that it <SIL> yknow <SIL> i have a hard time picturing an eighty three year old woman as a tammy <SIL> <IVER>
for example so you should name <SIL> her tamara <IVER>
and call her tammy when she's little <IVER>
and then she can be called tam <IVER>
yknow when she's in her middle years and tamara when she's <SIL> yknow <SIL> but <SIL> yknow i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing <SIL> it's the one thing in life we get to do <VOCNOISE> where there's no restrictions <SIL> no laws <SIL> nobody gives you any limitations or parameters <VOCNOISE> they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
over that <SIL> right <SIL> and <IVER>
i uh i say you should <SIL> look <VOCNOISE> what we did is we look in the newspaper <VOCNOISE> and we found the top ten boys and the top ten girls names that have been the most popular for the last fifty years <IVER>
and we pick out of those <SIL> because <SIL> otherwise <SIL> your kid's gonna hate you <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> emma's sort of a timeless name <SIL> in that it's <SIL> it's <SIL> yknow <SIL> been around for a long time <VOCNOISE> yet <SIL> people don't associate it with <VOCNOISE> old women because <VOCNOISE> there are still emma's today <IVER>
i mean <IVER>
right <IVER>
and i mean it's <VOCNOISE> it's a <CUTOFF-w=word> <SIL> easy to spell <SIL> it's easy to say <SIL> and yknow <CUTOFF-i=it's> you can shorten it to em <SIL> or <IVER>
<IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> some names are just like <VOCNOISE> we had a friend once that <SIL> she got pregnant <SIL> like after her two boys were almost grown up <VOCNOISE> and they didn't ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy <VOCNOISE> so she named the little girl after her mother and her mother's name was harriet <IVER>
and i'm like <VOCNOISE> how can you go gitchy gitchy goo harriet <IVER>

well <SIL> when you get into the black <SIL> population <SIL> you sometimes see some <IVER>
names <SIL> i uh <SIL> actually read a story <SIL> in some book <SIL> about this black lady that was having like her <SIL> ninth and tenth kid and <SIL> she didn't know what <VOCNOISE> she had twins <SIL> and she didn't know what to name them <SIL> and she'd run out of names that she liked so <VOCNOISE> they brought her um <SIL> lunch in to her <SIL> and the nurse jokingly said or the <CUTOFF-n=nurse> <VOCNOISE> aid or something <SIL> why don't you just pick couple of names off the menu <SIL> so she named them <SIL> lemonjello <SIL> and orangello <SIL> lemon jello <SIL> orange jello <SIL> she picked lemon jello orange jello and turned them into <SIL> lemonjello and orangello <LAUGH> <SIL> denise and denephew <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<IVER>
<LAUGH> but um <SIL> um one time <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> i read somewhere that <SIL> a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby <SIL> and they put the <VOCNOISE> little band on and they <SIL> wrote female <VOCNOISE> and then they wrote <SIL> her last name <SIL> she said to her husband when he came <SIL> over to see her <VOCNOISE> well they've already named her look femalee <IVER>
<ERROR-Chancez> or <CUTOFF-Shanse=Sanchez> <SIL> whatever <SIL> femalee <SIL> female so that was her name femalee <SIL> she thought boy they're nice in this country they even named my baby for me <VOCNOISE> people are so stupid <IVER>
yeah i do aren't they i've seen every name eight after twenty years of <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you've spelled every name you've read every name you've written every name <VOCNOISE> practically there aren't any that you haven't heard of <IVER>
<LAUGH-I> remember a time when i was <SIL> brand new teacher i was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> maybe <EXT-f> fifth or sixth year of teaching <SIL> that's still pretty new <SIL> this <SIL> john <SIL> i said john what's your last name <SIL> he said guess <SIL> i said i don't feel like guessing tell me your last name <VOCNOISE> he said guess <VOCNOISE> i said john <SIL> i want to know your last name and he said <SIL> g u e s s <LAUGH> i'm like oh <SIL> sorry <SIL> thank you <IVER>

oh yeah <SIL> i'm sure <IVER>
oh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i heard something the other day that really <CUTOFF-u=upset> <SIL> really upset me <VOCNOISE> i was at um <VOCNOISE> this convention downtown the convention center <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> uh one of the <VOCNOISE> ladies that was presenting one of the workshops is a <VOCNOISE> college professor in english <SIL> at one of the ohio colleges and she said <SIL> <VOCNOISE> when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five <VOCNOISE> they would always <SIL> she teaches writing <SIL> technical writing <SIL> for people to do when they get out into the industry world <VOCNOISE> reports and stuff <VOCNOISE> she said they used to say <SIL> gear your writing <SIL> to a person who's in the eighth grade <IVER>
she said you know what they say now <SIL> and i raised my hand and said sixth <SIL> she said <SIL> fourth <IVER>
gear your writing <SIL> for a fourth grader and everyone will that you <SIL> <ERROR-everymbody=everybody> that's gonna read the memo will be able to read <IVER>
<IVER>
well <IVER>
doesn't have any words in it like exacerbate or undoubtedly i tell you that <LAUGH> <IVER>
but that's yknow that's a sign that <SIL> that <SIL> not only are we doing the dumbing down of jobs <IVER>
<IVER>
doing the dumbing down of schools <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
reader's digest <SIL> used to write their <SIL> digest on the eighth grade level and they now write it on the sixth grade level <SIL> newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level <VOCNOISE> for the general public it's just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> either <VOCNOISE> we're getting more and more l d kids that aren't learning to read <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> i read one article <VOCNOISE> that said that <VOCNOISE> because kids sit in front of a television set <SIL> from the time they're born until they're five <VOCNOISE> when they come to kindergarten they don't participate <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they want to sit back and be entertained <SIL> and they're expecting you to do all this stuff <SIL> and they're just gonna watch <IVER>
and they have to become an active learner and they have to be taught how to participate <IVER>
mm <IVER>
not so much when i was teaching it <SIL> because <SIL> i think <IVER>
when i was teaching it <SIL> that was kind of before all the moms went to work <IVER>
but since <SIL> all the moms have gone to work <SIL> and let the tv become the electronic babysitter <VOCNOISE> and the other thing that's happening <SIL> is kids do not know things now that you'd expect them to know like <VOCNOISE> because their moms aren't reading to them <SIL> like they don't know who winnie the pooh is <IVER>
or they don't know who eyor <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> or you <SIL> say something to a kid about um three blind mice <IVER>
or yknow the things that we learned when we were kids because <VOCNOISE> our mom <SIL> taught them or we learned them at church in a game or something <VOCNOISE> they all look at you like <SIL> christopher robin who's that <SIL> piglet <SIL> who's that <VOCNOISE> yknow these there's a whole generation of kids now <VOCNOISE> whose moms did not stay home and read to them and all that fairy tale stuff <VOCNOISE> and nursery rhyme stuff <VOCNOISE> they don't have a clue what you're talking about <IVER>
well <SIL> some of them are i guess <VOCNOISE> depending on <SIL> where they go but <VOCNOISE> i had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid <VOCNOISE> she only has maybe one or two kids in her whole class <VOCNOISE> that hasn't gone to preschool <SIL> or daycare <VOCNOISE> and she said it takes that kid <SIL> up till christmas <SIL> to catch up <SIL> with the <SIL> things the other kids come in already knowing <SIL> that's how far behind they are <VOCNOISE> used to be in kindergarten you were expected <VOCNOISE> to know your colors <SIL> and your name and your address <SIL> you didn't even have to write it it <SIL> you just had to know how to say it and your phone number <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> recognize the color words <SIL> and <SIL> know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills <VOCNOISE> and that was about <EXT-all> they expected you to <SIL> play cooperatively <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> that's about all they expect you to know now in kindergarten <VOCNOISE> they expected you to know all that <VOCNOISE> plus by the time you get to first grade you're supposed to have <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-b=?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-in=?> <SIL> oh and the numbers you used to <SIL> from one to thirty <SIL> it used to be if you could <CUTOFF-s=say> <SIL> uh <SIL> say them <SIL> in order <SIL> and recognize them <SIL> you didn't even have to know how to spell the word <VOCNOISE> or write them down <VOCNOISE> now <SIL> they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred <VOCNOISE> you're supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade <SIL> 
<VOCNOISE> like and the of is all those little words <SIL> you're already supposed to know those <VOCNOISE> you're supposed to <SIL> be able to write a sentence <SIL> even if it's just a little short sentence like my name is joanne <VOCNOISE> i live at blah blah blah street <VOCNOISE> i mean it's incredible <VOCNOISE> it's like <SIL> the curriculum keeps moving down <SIL> and down <SIL> and down <IVER>
well <SIL> they're supposed to do more too but by the time they get to fourth grade they're so busy trying to be the class clown <VOCNOISE> they decide it's a lot more important to impress your friends than it is to <VOCNOISE> fill your mind with knowledge <IVER>
yknow <SIL> they talk about drinking from the fountain now they're only gargling <SIL> they're not drinking <SIL> much <SIL> by the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade they're pretty savvy these days <SIL> they're not <SIL> too scared to tell you <SIL> where to go and what to do <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> oh yeah used to be <VOCNOISE> when i first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful <IVER>
and they would ask yknow can i do this can i use this <VOCNOISE> uh kids now if i take my phone off and lay it on my desk <VOCNOISE> kids will walk right up and just take it <SIL> they won't ask me they'll just <CUTOFF-l=?> <VOCNOISE> oh <VOCNOISE> and then they start pushing <CUTOFF-but=buttons> <VOCNOISE> is this your phone <VOCNOISE> i'm like <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> if i were at your house and i went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking you wouldn't like it much would you <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
just general manners <IVER>
i think it's because parents are at work and they're busy making money and they're not teaching their kids any <VOCNOISE> i mean they're not <CUTOFF-ta=taking?> teaching them to say thank you and please and just the normal <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> um thanks for having me when you go to someone's house <VOCNOISE> just the normal <SIL> i can't tell you how many kids i've picked up <VOCNOISE> and driven home <SIL> when i picked up my son because it was raining or something <VOCNOISE> and they just jump out of the car and go bye slam the door <VOCNOISE> and i turn to my son and i go <SIL> don't you ever do that to someone's mother <VOCNOISE> now how bad do you think i want to give <SIL> him another ride home <VOCNOISE> when he didn't even say thank you <SIL> yknow i didn't have to bother to go out of my way <VOCNOISE> and i'd always try to use that as a <SIL> way to explain to my kids <SIL> okay yknow <SIL> this is how he handled it <VOCNOISE> this is how i want you to handle it <VOCNOISE> i don't ever want you to go to someone's house and not say <VOCNOISE> thanks for inviting me thanks for having me <VOCNOISE> i really had a good time <VOCNOISE> yknow and i don't ever want you to sit at somebody else's table and go <VOCNOISE> yuk i don't like that <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> if they having something for supper you don't like <VOCNOISE> you pass it <VOCNOISE> on and you go i don't care for any thank you <VOCNOISE> you don't make a big scene like so and so did the other night at my house that <SIL> yknow made me feel like this big <SIL> when i'm the cook <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> so you can use all those <SIL> opportunities <SIL> to show your kid <SIL> what not to do <IVER>
and you can say well that's how that makes you feel when someone goes <VOCNOISE> eew we're having ham <VOCNOISE> i hate ham the other night i had ham and i threw up and blah blah <VOCNOISE> and my mom made me eat it and i threw up all over the floor and i'm like <VOCNOISE> don't you ever do that when you're at someone else's <CUTOFF-hou=house> <LAUGH> <IVER>
they know more knowledge <SIL> i wouldn't say they're more <VOCNOISE> <SIL> socially <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mature or uh more um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i mean there's even sweet little preschool girls that don't say please and thank you <SIL> yknow you have to remind them <IVER>
<SIL> well and i think it really <CUTOFF-sti=still> it still goes back to the mom and the dad <SIL> and <SIL> and what <SIL> the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow would i act this way would that make my mom and because until you're about five <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or four <SIL> your parents are pretty important to you <SIL> and what they think <VOCNOISE> so that's when <SIL> yknow <SIL> you have to instill that stuff <SIL> you have to <SIL> yknow <SIL> <CUTOFF-the=they> oh and they learn by watching you do it too <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i mean my son now oh i saw him when let's see <SIL> he was fifteen maybe <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he'd run across the street <SIL> when martha the eighty six year old lady across <ERROR-steereet=the_street> <VOCNOISE> was trying to bring her garbage down <SIL> he'd seen me do that <SIL> go oh let me get that for you martha <VOCNOISE> she's got <SIL> arthritis she looks like she's gonna fall <SIL> she takes steps about this big <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i've seen him do that <IVER>
he learned that from watching me do it <SIL> he takes <CUTOFF-i=it?> yknow we come home he'll take the <CUTOFF-b=bag?> <SIL> the thing back up for her <UNKNOWN-say> oh martha will fall if she does this i better run over there and <VOCNOISE> take that up for her <VOCNOISE> well he's seen <SIL> his <CUTOFF-mo=mom> his mom and his dad do stuff like that <VOCNOISE> they really do learn best by example <SIL> they really do <SIL> yeah they do <SIL> they're much more likely to do what you do than do what you say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so you don't have to say anything as long as you live a good clean honest life <VOCNOISE> they're gonna emulate you <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
oh i think <SIL> i think that the society <SIL> in uh general is declining in a <LAUGH-lot_of> ways <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> our morals are <ERROR-degclining=degrading+declining?> and our <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> intelligence level <SIL> maybe not level i mean i q's are still high but people are <VOCNOISE> settling for less <SIL> i have a big sign in my room that says never settle <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for less than your very best <VOCNOISE> because i really think people <VOCNOISE> are getting lazy <SIL> even adults <CUTOFF-we=we> yknow we don't even want to wait twenty five seconds for microwave popcorn <VOCNOISE> we don't yknow we're getting impatient <IVER>
yeah we're getting impatient and we're getting <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> it's it's sort of like yknow the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from now there'll be <VOCNOISE> kids'll be yknow in this country will be learning more than they ever have <VOCNOISE> but right now i think we're <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we're really not <SIL> doing justice <SIL> to <SIL> the curriculum <SIL> and i say to <CUTOFF-m=my> my friends i say <VOCNOISE> teach these kids well because they're gonna be running the country in our old age <VOCNOISE> we'll be sit in a rocking chair and they'll be running the country so you better teach them well <SIL> when you look at it like that <IVER>
you it's quite an investment <IVER>
<IVER>
when you think that <SIL> our major resource <SIL> is <CUTOFF-ch=children> <SIL> is our children and our offspring <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then we'd better not <SIL> yknow <IVER>
well i think <IVER>
well i think in general like <SIL> let's say if you took <SIL> a <SIL> handful of executives from borden or <VOCNOISE> a t and t or <VOCNOISE> someplace like that <VOCNOISE> you would probably find that <SIL> in general they're very concerned <IVER>
if they're especially if they're over forty <VOCNOISE> because their company's giving money back to the community for this and that <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> yknow that's how they're trying to show that they care about this they're trying to <VOCNOISE> mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the <VOCNOISE> downtrodden or <SIL> yknow <SIL> but <SIL> you're right i think it's terrible that <SIL> every other country in the world <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> has higher math skills than we do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> better science skills than we do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> better language <ERROR-shkills=skills> than we do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> why canadians even go to school for thirteen years not twelve <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> i just think that <SIL> this proficiency thing is finally going to <VOCNOISE> make people accountable <SIL> <IVER>
the proficiency tests that they're now requiring <VOCNOISE> you can't graduate from an ohio high school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> with a <CUTOFF-gra=graduate> uh with a diploma <SIL> unless you pass <SIL> all the proficiency tests <VOCNOISE> and that means you have to take <VOCNOISE> one in citizenship <SIL> which is like government and history <VOCNOISE> one in math <VOCNOISE> one in science <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> one in writing <SIL> and one in reading <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you have <SIL> you can try to <SIL> pass <VOCNOISE> the first time in the <CUTOFF-e=eighth> at the end of the eighth grade <VOCNOISE> and you get two tries in the ninth grade <SIL> two tries in the tenth <SIL> two in the eleventh two in the twelfth <VOCNOISE> you can take them as many times as you need to take them <VOCNOISE> but if you don't pass them all by the time you graduate <VOCNOISE> you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate <SIL> it's not a real diploma it's like okay i attended <SIL> i didn't learn anything <VOCNOISE> but i was there <IVER>
how many people want that <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
and the questions aren't easy <SIL> <SIL> i mean <SIL> i mean the <SIL> i doubt if i could pass some of them <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i probably could pass the citizenship and the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the english <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and maybe the science because i like science and i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass the math <SIL> because i don't teach math and i don't use math that much <VOCNOISE> other than just normal <SIL> yknow add subtract multiply <IVER>
yeah and geometry and and trig and calculus and physics and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a little smattering of everything <SIL> and uh <SIL> i bet i couldn't pass the <VOCNOISE> i bet i couldn't pass the math without some <VOCNOISE> instruction <SIL> but <SIL> my son didn't pass the writing part he passed everything but the writing part <VOCNOISE> and the writing part <SIL> they ask you to write <SIL> two <SIL> five paragraph essays and they give you these topics and you can pick from them <VOCNOISE> and you have to do it right there <SIL> in like a three hour block of time <IVER>
no <SIL> the prompts are only given out that day <VOCNOISE> even the teachers don't know what they're gonna be <VOCNOISE> and it might be something as general as tell about your neighborhood <VOCNOISE> or it might be something as specific as <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when you were little what <SIL> toy was your most favorite <SIL> and you have to write five paragraphs on it <SIL> so <LAUGH> <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
no more than five because there's a specific <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> it's called the five paragraph essay <SIL> the first paragraph is your introduction and the final one is your conclusion and the three in the middle is the body that develops your idea <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> i'm teaching all my kids right <IVER>
one of those <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
on different topics <IVER>
oh it's some committee <SIL> i mean you have to send them in to <VOCNOISE> some place at the state of ohio <IVER>
no <IVER>
we send them in <SIL> and then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the kids <SIL> lets see the eighth graders take them in march and then we get the <CUTOFF-pa=papers> <VOCNOISE> the scores back in may <SIL> sometime <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> some of my kids <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well i have a group of kids that i had them when they were sixth graders and they just now graduated <SIL> 
from high school and <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> one in that original group of kids that i had <VOCNOISE> never did pass them all <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i guess <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he's not worried because he's gonna work with his dad in his dad's business <SIL> so he's gonna be okay but <VOCNOISE> he never did pass the reading and the writing he passed everything else but <VOCNOISE> and the questions aren't the same <SIL> <CUTOFF-the=there's> i mean there's several different forms every time they send out <SIL> the test it's sealed in a box and <SIL> nobody is allowed to open it but the principal <SIL> and <SIL> then he has to distribute it to the teachers and <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=and> so the questions could change <IVER>
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag <VOCNOISE> or uh how much of a <SIL> uh <SIL> how much do you have to have of the senate <VOCNOISE> to pass a law <SIL> yknow it could be something real real <SIL> technical or something <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> a three year old could answer <SIL> because it's trying to hit <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> all the areas that you've learned <IVER>
i think they're retired teachers or <VOCNOISE> people on maybe the board at different school districts or <SIL> i don't know <VOCNOISE> well <IVER>
course the multiple choice there's a right or wrong answer and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but <SIL> the writing <VOCNOISE> they give you one point for each <SIL> paragraph so you hafta get <SIL> five points to pass <SIL> <SIL> now you might get four out of five and almost pass <SIL> and then you hafta retake that one part <IVER>
<SIL> well yeah that's kind of subjective although <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there is a paper that <SIL> we hand out to our kids that's tells exactly what's supposed to be in every part of this essay <VOCNOISE> like the first the introductory paragraph's supposed to consist of <VOCNOISE> a way to capture the reader's attention <SIL> it's suppose to supply background information <VOCNOISE> it's supposed to state your thesis statement which tells mainly what the <CUTOFF-pa=paper's> paper's gonna be about <VOCNOISE> and then you're supposed to end the introductory paragraph by listing three ideas <SIL> about your thesis <VOCNOISE> that you're going to develop in paragraphs two three and four <VOCNOISE> so i mean it's <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
well most kids what they do is <SIL> they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the <CUTOFF-intr=introduction> <VOCNOISE> most people get ahead of themselves <IVER>
yknow before they <VOCNOISE> tell you <SIL> this was last summer and it was on a vacation to myrtle beach <VOCNOISE> they're telling you about the surfboard that they got <SIL> and how <SIL> great they surfed <VOCNOISE> when that really should come down in the body of the paper <VOCNOISE> yknow most people just <SIL> they assume the reader knows <SIL> i always say to my kids <VOCNOISE> pretend like you're writing for an alien <IVER>
<IVER>
nothing about this planet <IVER>
like i had my kids last week i had them all write <VOCNOISE> how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they didn't know i was gonna do this <VOCNOISE> so after they get <CUTOFF-e=everything?> all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread and my peanut butter and my jelly <VOCNOISE> and i sit them down beside me <VOCNOISE> and i go okay now no ad libbing <SIL> no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote <IVER>
and i do exactly what they said <VOCNOISE> if they say cover the entire piece of bread with peanut butter <VOCNOISE> i cover both sides <IVER>
crust <VOCNOISE> uh the entire piece of bread <VOCNOISE> if they say reach in the <VOCNOISE> bag and grab two pieces of bread i reach in the bag and grab them and by the time i get them out they've got holes in them <VOCNOISE> because to me that's what grab means <IVER>
whereas <SIL> yknow <IVER>
if you just said take <SIL> or get <SIL> i just <SIL> i say well <SIL> i'm just gonna <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because when you get <UNKNOWN-in_that_in_the?> work <SIL> out in the work world <SIL> there's gonna be two things they care about about your writing <SIL> is it useable <SIL> and is it persuasive <SIL> because usually when you're writing something in the workplace <VOCNOISE> it's either to explain something <SIL> or it's to persuade somebody to do something <SIL> so if it's not those two things <SIL> it's not <SIL> it's not writing <SIL> that's gonna make it in the world <SIL> it's i mean <IVER>
oh i have a few kids from time to time that said they want to be writers <VOCNOISE> which yknow they have great ideas but usually <VOCNOISE> they can't <SIL> they can tell you them but when they write it <SIL> my kids <VOCNOISE> usually <VOCNOISE> they leave out words or they <VOCNOISE> leave off a suffix at the end or and the sentence makes no sense <SIL> yknow <SIL> i have to call them up and go <SIL> what does this say <IVER>
or does this say this <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> this is what i thought this said does that what that really says <VOCNOISE> well here's a perfect example the other day <VOCNOISE> my kids <SIL> my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here's the animal i would be and here's why <VOCNOISE> and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it <VOCNOISE> and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and their <VOCNOISE> whether they travel in groups or alone and <VOCNOISE> of what part of the world they mostly habitat <VOCNOISE> what they eat all that <VOCNOISE> okay perfect example <SIL> one of my students wanted to say <VOCNOISE> my animal <SIL> that i picked lives mostly on vegetables <VOCNOISE> and he couldn't figure out how to spell it <VOCNOISE> so he went into the computer and he <SIL> asked it <VOCNOISE> and it gave him the word vestibules <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
said to me that can't be wrong because the computer said <SIL> that was a word <VOCNOISE> i said that is a word <VOCNOISE> come with me i'll show you what a vestibule is <IVER>
so we walked across the street to the church <IVER>
<IVER>
i said there's a big <IVER>
that's a vestibule <SIL> does your animal eat those <SIL> my animal eats mostly vestibules <IVER>
i <LAUGH-see> <LAUGH-I> mean you see <VOCNOISE> the computer <SIL> can't be wrong he said <IVER>
i said well he <CUTOFF-di=didn't> it didn't spell vestibules wrong <VOCNOISE> but i doubt if your animal eats <SIL> parts of buildings <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
perfect yknow or your computer can't tell you that you <VOCNOISE> spelled o n e <SIL> when you meant to spell <SIL> w o n <IVER>
we won we were victorious <VOCNOISE> we didn't one <SIL> <LAUGH> <LAUGH_yknow> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> uh <IVER>
uh <SIL> well a lot of my kids do much better <VOCNOISE> with writing on the computer <VOCNOISE> because they know that <VOCNOISE> they can go back and change it or fix it or they can get spelling help or they can even get grammar help <VOCNOISE> or they can maybe even get <VOCNOISE> syntax help <CUTOFF-i=if> <SIL> if it says this is awkward or something turn the sentence around <VOCNOISE> so my students do a lot better with writing if they do it on the computer <VOCNOISE> than if they are asked to do it <SIL> pencil and paper <SIL> so that's what i make them do their webbing <SIL> you know what a webbing is don't you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> where you <CUTOFF-p=put?> <SIL> web out an idea you <IVER>
and it looks like a spider web <IVER>
i make them do their webbing <SIL> and get their rough draft started <SIL> and then they can go to the computer <SIL> because they i find they um they are a little more creative when they get to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> think about adding pictures and <VOCNOISE> we call it publishing it <SIL> when you get to the publishing stage <IVER>
you should have all your errors corrected <VOCNOISE> even if you <VOCNOISE> have to rewrite it six times i mean <CUTOFF-tha=that> it just blows their mind when i say to them <VOCNOISE> well the other day i wrote a letter to a senator <SIL> and i had to write it six times <SIL> i wrote the letter <SIL> and rewrote it <VOCNOISE> until it was perfect <VOCNOISE> and every time i rewrote it it got better <SIL> and i wrote it six times <SIL> and i'm an english teacher <IVER>
and i tell them writing is not an event <SIL> it's a process <SIL> it's like getting your braces put on <SIL> you go in one time <SIL> and they might pull a couple teeth <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you go in the next time they might put that little wire on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then you go in the next time they might put the lower ones on or part of them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the next time <SIL> then they put on more <VOCNOISE> and then one time <SIL> they'll tighten them a little <VOCNOISE> but it's a process that happens over a period of three years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's not an event <VOCNOISE> they think they can sit down and write <SIL> okay i'm done <SIL> i'm like <LAUGH> <SIL> i don't think so <SIL> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> writing is a <IVER>
<IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well and <IVER>
don't you think <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well i often have to write on papers <VOCNOISE> i believe you turned in the wrong paper <VOCNOISE> i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy <VOCNOISE> do you have the final copy somewhere at home <IVER>
or on your hard drive <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft <SIL> or i'll say to my students have your mom look it over have your sister look it over <VOCNOISE> have somebody else proofread it <VOCNOISE> because you're not gonna see the mistakes because <VOCNOISE> you're too busy thinking about the content <SIL> of what you wanted to say <VOCNOISE> and you're not gonna notice them spelled t h i m <VOCNOISE> or they t h a y <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> or a sentence that's too long <SIL> or a sentence that's a fragment and it isn't a complete thought <SIL> you're not gonna notice that <VOCNOISE> because you know what it was supposed say <VOCNOISE> so give it to a p friend or somebody and let them <VOCNOISE> just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they don't understand <SIL> and that will really help you <SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> well i had a <IVER>
<SIL> i had a student bring me a paper today <VOCNOISE> he said this is for history <VOCNOISE> i have to write an essay on anthony wayne 
and the battle at fallen timbers <VOCNOISE> here's my i rough draft <VOCNOISE> would you fix it for me before i make my final copy so i'll get a good grade <VOCNOISE> see <CUTOFF-I=I> i tell them i said <NOISE-that's> what i'm here for <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i'm here to help you <SIL> use me <VOCNOISE> to help you get better grades <VOCNOISE> use me to run interference <VOCNOISE> if you think you know the science <VOCNOISE> but you're getting marked down because you can't spell the words <VOCNOISE> let me know i'll go talk to your science teacher <VOCNOISE> tell her not to count your spelling <SIL> or not <SIL> yknow not to make you take the test without the little spell checker thing that's in your book bag <VOCNOISE> to let you use that i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i do a lot of um <VOCNOISE> what i call advocating for my kids with the regular ed teachers that don't understand <SIL> i go in and i say well <VOCNOISE> yknow this is kind of a long test <VOCNOISE> could he maybe take half today and half tomorrow <VOCNOISE> or <SIL> would you mind if he came out to my room <SIL> ninth period during study hall <VOCNOISE> because i have a free <NOISE-period> and i could <SIL> like kind of monitor it and <VOCNOISE> and read the words he doesn't know so that he's actually answering what the question really says <VOCNOISE> instead of what he thinks it says <VOCNOISE> so that you won't be testing his reading ability but you'll really be testing whether he knows about magnetism <IVER>
oh <IVER>
<IVER>
oh yes they're getting better though they really are <VOCNOISE> they're much better now than they were twenty years ago <VOCNOISE> because <NOISE-the> trend is <SIL> <NOISE-to> <NOISE-keep> these students in the mainstream as much as possible <VOCNOISE> so teachers are having to learn <VOCNOISE> to <VOCNOISE> for example <IVER>
yeah how to modify <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> i give <SIL> in services all the time at my school for the regular ed teachers and i show them <VOCNOISE> they go well that's gonna make more work for me and i say how is telling the student to do every other problem <VOCNOISE> instead of all forty of them gonna make <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
i'm <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> so <SIL> or <SIL> how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an eighty i q for example <VOCNOISE> and you know he's not gonna get all the details and the battles and the years and the <VOCNOISE> captain's names but <SIL> you just want him to get the overall gist of the french and american war was about this time uh <CUTOFF-p=period?> <VOCNOISE> in history and this was the result and this is how long it lasted <VOCNOISE> just the main concepts <VOCNOISE> well there's the kid that you say <SIL> todd <SIL> you study for the test and when you come in i'll let you answer anything on the test you know <SIL> and anything you don't know you leave blank <SIL> and i'll just grade what you put down <IVER>
now that doesn't make any extra work for the teacher <SIL> but <SIL> it gives him a shot <SIL> he usually will answer <SIL> the concepts he'll usually answer the main stuff that he knows <VOCNOISE> and if you only grade him on that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he might have a shot at a c or a b <SIL> i mean there's <SIL> all kind of ways to modify <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-r=reduced?> <SIL> give a reduced work amount <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh give a kid a copy of another students notes if his are crummy and he <CUTOFF-k=can't?> can't study from them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we even have a thing at our school <SIL> that <SIL> it's <SIL> it looks just like notebook paper <VOCNOISE> and it's got the three holes and the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk <VOCNOISE> but it's <SIL> n c r <SIL> yknow the <SIL> two copies <SIL> <IVER>
you write on the top <IVER>
n c r paper <VOCNOISE> so when you write on the white copy it comes through onto the yellow copy <VOCNOISE> and at the end of the period <VOCNOISE> the student just rips off the back copy and hands it to his friend <SIL> so he didn't have to write <SIL> yknow if he wasn't getting the notes <IVER>
<SIL> and he didn't spell them and he couldn't read them later <VOCNOISE> nobody has to know that <SIL> so and so went down the hall and made a copy of so and so's notes on the xerox machine for the dumb kid <SIL> yknow <SIL> you just <SIL> yknow you just <SIL> say to one <SIL> student that sits in the front that's usually a girl <VOCNOISE> who usually yknow writes really neat and gets it all <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> just go suzy would you <VOCNOISE> use this paper today <VOCNOISE> because we're gonna review for the test <SIL> and then at the end of the period <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when the kids are leaving <SIL> and give johnnie a copy of it <SIL> the back copy would you do that for me <SIL> well the girls usually write neater <SIL> and they usually get <SIL> a girl that doesn't have a learning disability they usually get everything down off the board <VOCNOISE> whereas the boys <NOISE-will> get a little distracted <VOCNOISE> or they'll <SIL> yknow maybe not <CUTOFF-si=sit> <SIL> they don't tend to sit up front <SIL> they'll sit in the back so they can <SIL> yknow <SIL> jab their friend with a pencil and <VOCNOISE> throw the <CUTOFF-f=?> <SIL> paper wads and stuff <SIL> <IVER>
so <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> almost always <VOCNOISE> doesn't matter what <SIL> um the disability is <SIL> <LAUGH-and> <LAUGH-I> don't know why this is <VOCNOISE> but they used to say eight to one <VOCNOISE> now they're saying more like five to one <VOCNOISE> doesn't matter if it's a speech impediment <SIL> blindness retardation <VOCNOISE> cerebral palsy deafness <VOCNOISE> learning <CUTOFF-disa=disability> you name it <SIL> there's <CUTOFF-a=always?> <SIL> five to one more boys than there are girls <SIL> and we don't <SIL> know why <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
well deafness for example uh and blindness are not always genetic <VOCNOISE> they don't know why <SIL> they just know that <ERROR-thit=that_it> <SIL> shows up more in boys than girls <SIL> this year i don't have <VOCNOISE> one i have sixteen students <SIL> and i don't have one girl <SIL> fact i haven't had any girls for a couple of years <SIL> i usually have one or two girls and all the rest boys <SIL> but <IVER>
oh <IVER>
they're not as many of them or <SIL> you mean because <IVER>
well um <SIL> in the lower grades i believe that they are because <SIL> i think they should have some male <SIL> role models <IVER>
the lower grades <SIL> we have a few <SIL> male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many <VOCNOISE> but i think <SIL> that <SIL> young men <SIL> young boys would do better <SIL> in a <SIL> setting in school if they had a <SIL> a man earlier on <SIL> rather than having to wait till <VOCNOISE> they're in middle school <SIL> to relate to a coach <SIL> and up until then it's always been a woman <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
don't go into elementary ed that much <IVER>
that often <SIL> they do but <VOCNOISE> there's just not near as many of them <SIL> i can count on one hand the number of <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-m=men> um <SIL> men teachers i've known over the years in elementary ed <SIL> practically <VOCNOISE> yknow five <SIL> maybe six <SIL> that's that's probably why the boys don't <SIL> yknow <SIL> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
really <SIL> and it's a fun job it really is i <CUTOFF-n=?> i've only ever known one male <SIL> that taught first grade <SIL> and i knew one guy that taught third <SIL> most the time if they go in to elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> i really think that <SIL> if we let <SIL> the boys be more exposed to men earlier <SIL> then <SIL> they would <SIL> be more motivated to learn <VOCNOISE> because they would see that it's not just a girly thing <VOCNOISE> they would say oh well mister so and so thinks it's important that i know this <SIL> and he's a real macho guy so i better learn it <SIL> yknow <SIL> i do i really do <SIL> nowadays <SIL> with the pay <SIL> being better <SIL> we are getting more men <SIL> but <IVER>
in most <CUTOFF-ci=cities> <SIL> in most <CUTOFF-area=areas> in most school districts it's <VOCNOISE> comparable to <SIL> any other job now it used to always be low but <VOCNOISE> like a <SIL> beginning teacher in worthington starts at i think twenty six <SIL> eight <SIL> or something <SIL> course worthington's <SIL> one of the <SIL> three highest paid districts in ohio <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> it used to be that <VOCNOISE> teachers <SIL> just got paid <SIL> lower than a <CUTOFF-f=fireman> <SIL> starting fireman or starting policeman and <VOCNOISE> yknow you in a sense you're out there risking your life everyday too <IVER>
now that kids are carrying knives and guns and <VOCNOISE> things to school you never know if you're gonna walk into the building and <SIL> and maybe not go home that day <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> people say <VOCNOISE> things like <SIL> oh i wish i had a job where i got three months off every summer <VOCNOISE> and i'm just i hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store and i just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say <VOCNOISE> yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game <VOCNOISE> i was grading papers at the kitchen table <SIL> yknow <SIL> and if i go out of town on the weekend <SIL> i have to take my school bag and all my work with me <VOCNOISE> it never ends <SIL> yknow i put in about seventy hours a week during <SIL> the time of the year when i do teach <VOCNOISE> and by the way it's not three months anymore <SIL> you work for a week after the kids get out of school in june <SIL> which usually <SIL> puts you at about the twelfth to the fifteenth of june <SIL> school starts back the twenty third of august <SIL> at least in worthington it did <SIL> and you have to be back a week before that <SIL> so they've shaved both ends of that off till it's <SIL> it's like <SIL> <NOISE-ten> days in june <SIL> and maybe <VOCNOISE> fifteen days in august <SIL> and all of july <SIL> so <SIL> and then you spend some of that time going to seminars <VOCNOISE> and upgrading your certificate <IVER>
taking classes <VOCNOISE> hopefully <SIL> that's when you go to the dentist <EXT-and> yknow you catch up on all that stuff too <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <SIL> right if you're lucky <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but i mean <SIL> there's the person that says that and then there's the other person that says <SIL> oh i sure admire what you do and i wouldn't be a teacher for anything in this world <LAUGH> yknow and the the one that's just in awe of you <IVER>
and then there's the one that's like i wish i had two weeks off at christmas <VOCNOISE> well i used to work at harding hospital as a teacher <SIL> when <SIL> um <SIL> i first went to worthington when i said i got another job <SIL> i got <SIL> a job <VOCNOISE> <SIL> working at harding hospital as the <SIL> i was the principal <SIL> but i was also a teacher so i taught part of the day <VOCNOISE> and i was also the administrator <VOCNOISE> because they had a small school there for the kids that were in the adolescent unit <VOCNOISE> and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credit somewhere <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> the doctors always used to <SIL> we were on the <VOCNOISE> like each <SIL> person would be on a team <VOCNOISE> of these kids that would be assigned to these kids <VOCNOISE> and you'd go to your team meetings and the doctors <SIL> the <CUTOFF-s=shrinks> shrinks would go <VOCNOISE> i wish i got two weeks off at christmas yknow they'd be bitching and moaning about the fact that <VOCNOISE> that we got time off and they didn't <SIL> <LAUGH-and> <LAUGH-I> finally come up with the perfect thing one time i said well doctor simpson or whatever his name was doctor brown <VOCNOISE> you know how it is some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off <IVER>
<SIL> he never said a thing again <LAUGH> like oh okay we went for the big bucks <VOCNOISE> we went for the time off <SIL> everybody makes their choices <SIL> now you got to live with them <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> these kids don't get well just because it's the holidays <SIL> <UNKNOWN-well> you guys should stay here and work along with us <VOCNOISE> yeah right <SIL> we should also get <NOISE> a hundred and twenty five bucks an hour like you guys do to <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh i'll come back <SIL> i mean <SIL> if you need me to <IVER>
<SIL> 
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH_um-hum_okay> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
it's very difficult <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i don't know why <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh columbus was just stubborn about it until <VOCNOISE> the last year <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> they hadn't <ERROR-beyn_able=been_able> able to get subs fifty <CUTOFF-perc=percent> <SIL> substitutes fifty percent of the time and so the teachers were screaming <VOCNOISE> and they were splitting the kids up and putting them in other classrooms well <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know if the parents made anything about it but i guess <SIL> finally <VOCNOISE> yknow when you have fifty percent of your classrooms uncovered <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh they <SIL> came to it and it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody <VOCNOISE> the kids the principal or the other teachers but now it's like <VOCNOISE> oh thank you for coming oh thank you for coming <VOCNOISE> so i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think a lot of the retired teachers who weren't messing around with it have come back in <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i don't know exactly what to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
well <SIL> uh <SIL> when i came <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh back from oregon <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my father was very ill <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so i didn't want full time work and i started substituting out in uh licking county <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-ih=?> which <SIL> paid <CUTOFF-t=terribly> <CUTOFF-ch=?> <CUTOFF-t=terribly> terribly low <CUTOFF-the=there's> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-the=there's> there's all these little districts that has <SIL> a superintendent <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well no they have two elementaries one middle school and one high school and a superintendent which they don't need yknow <VOCNOISE> so they'd <VOCNOISE> hire <VOCNOISE> straight out of college always <VOCNOISE> and there there is a law that <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> uh you have to pay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for your accumulated time <VOCNOISE> so i couldn't get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me <SIL> for <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i came <CUTOFF-i=in> back in to columbus and it's a lot harder to work in columbus public but <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> i i know the territory i know where i'm <LAUGH-going> <LAUGH> <IVER>
the population <SIL> <CUTOFF-n=?> is much different yes <IVER>
well <CUTOFF-th=the> you have uh you have an urban area with a lot of poor children <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> a lot of single parent families and just the population is changing period <VOCNOISE> <SIL> from the uh the two parent family very <VOCNOISE> the mother not working into <SIL> one parent with the mother working it makes a big difference in how the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> child does at school <IVER>
yes it's definitely having an effect on uh children and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they aren't doing it yet <SIL> whether they will be able to pick up enough <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i don't know but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i'm glad my children went to school when they did <LAUGH> <LAUGH-and_I> stayed home with them <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH> you should be <VOCNOISE> <SIL> real attentive to what's happening in his school situation <SIL> his or her <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-w=well> you should be we're all aware because the school has a big <CUTOFF-ha=hand> <VOCNOISE> impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now <SIL> so <SIL> yknow but you can tell <SIL> how your child's doing of course <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at this point <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm not <CUTOFF-ag=against> <SIL> uh i'm not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i wouldn't <ERROR-mrv=move> <SIL> move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they are <CUTOFF-s=so> <SIL> in so uh such bad shape right now that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah <VOCNOISE> they've threatened it <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and if they don't pull their scores up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um they will <VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <CUTOFF-opin=opinion> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh well i'm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um my opinion changes from day to day on <LAUGH-whose_fault_it_is> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh actually <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at this point in time i don't know who's fault it is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i think it's the <CUTOFF-f=fault> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fault of evolution <LAUGH> well it could have been prevented but we didn't know it was gonna happen that <CUTOFF-th=that> <SIL> that our society was gonna change so intensely and we kind of <VOCNOISE> hung back and thought things would stay the same way they were and they haven't and everybody's changing and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> especially the younger people <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we weren't ready and we didn't change fast <LAUGH-enough_we_didn't_get> ready for the change that was coming <IVER>
columbus <SIL> it seems to be <LAUGH> i mean it's just like blah <LAUGH> <IVER>
i at this point i blame it on the administration <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and the citizens of columbus haven't i mean uh two years ago or was it three years ago now <VOCNOISE> they defeated a levy <VOCNOISE> you should never defeat a school levy <IVER>
yknow they never ask for extra money <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they had to cut back on everything and <CUTOFF-i=it> i think it just set people back now we're trying real hard to catch up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and at some point we're going to um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow have to put a levy on again and <CUTOFF-a=and> and <SIL> uh <SIL> who knows what's happen <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we're keeping rosa smith right now because she's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so good p r with the with the business community but the business community in columbus doesn't really support the schools <CUTOFF-i=?> they don't <SIL> i mean we've got two new uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> stadiums and we haven't got any increase in school funding <SIL> 
i started the school year off with uh <VOCNOISE> twenty seven kindergarteners <SIL> and <SIL> no aid <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and they were just wild <SIL> yknow i just ran every minute and i <VOCNOISE> took it as a substitute <VOCNOISE> and didn't <SIL> know from day to day yknow whether was gonna keep it i finally had to say i cant do this twenty seven kindergarteners <VOCNOISE> i'm sorry i can't do this <LAUGH-by_myself> <LAUGH> <IVER>
the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> those things happen <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-y=yeah> they had to <CUTOFF-gr=grab> <SIL> and they just called me on the phone not knowing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> just that she went to the hospital <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well they said to me will you stay well i said yes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but then <CUTOFF-a=as> <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=as> when it got in to <VOCNOISE> two weeks and i wasn't getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it's like i'm sorry <VOCNOISE> i'm a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH-substitute_su-> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> substitute i'm getting sixty dollars a day i can't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> do this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> unless <SIL> yknow i have more help <VOCNOISE> and i just <SIL> flatly said that i'm sorry i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if i'd a <SIL> if it was my own job i would have struggled with it but it was not my own job <SIL> and i didn't know what was gonna happen <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> if they would've gotten some help in there <CUTOFF-f=for> <SIL> for me i would have stayed perhaps but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know you can work for under pay and under <LAUGH-staff_and_never> you just can't do everything <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
a computer calls you <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah-you> <IVER>
uh uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you talk to a computer always <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you deal with a computer <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you don't want to do it <CUTOFF-mo=most> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> most usually i just put location <SIL> i don't want to go certain places uh <IVER>
well like <VOCNOISE> a <ERROR-million> miles down to the south end or something like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but you just punch in your numbers always you just talk with numbers <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
uh huh <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh really <SIL> where are you from <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <CUTOFF-y=yeah> i i did i <IVER>
hm <IVER>
what's different <CUTOFF-i=is> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so <CUTOFF-th=that?> <VOCNOISE> from that angle was i mean still is my <VOCNOISE> elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it's there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a block away olentangy village <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm right in where i always was i mean i'm <SIL> i <CUTOFF-b=?> was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now <VOCNOISE> so i made a <ERROR-fell=full> <SIL> full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and it is really neat <SIL> you know compared to any other cities course <SIL> i'm <VOCNOISE> i loved oregon i was very rural <VOCNOISE> for eighteen years <IVER>
um um i was at eugene and i wasn't even <LAUGH-in_Eugene> it was hundred thousand yknow <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i loved that but <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> then i came back and i live in olentangy village which is right on the river <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it's very uh <SIL> very scenic very beautiful <IVER>
oh <IVER>
oh did you come in <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
it's kind of an neat place isn't it <IVER>
uh huh it's got <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
and uh well she <CUTOFF-star=started> the <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> uh the people that own it are starting to build it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> up now but it's been like that it was the first apartment community um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> in columbus it was built in thirty <VOCNOISE> <SIL> eight i guess <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
uh huh <VOCNOISE> and that's what i like about it is the ambience and the <VOCNOISE> the river and the <VOCNOISE> oh oh <VOCNOISE> and the apartments are just very very plain <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and but uh <IVER>
it's <IVER>
it is it is it's a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's kind of a oasis in the middle of the city <IVER>
so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh no the only thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that was really down there before i moved out was <LAUGH-the_Lincoln> leveque tower <LAUGH> the shortest one <LAUGH> <LAUGH-but> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh but of course the university is just about the same in some ways <SIL> the stadium and all that <IVER>
it's better in terms of the arts <IVER>
and there's all kinds of things going on i mean you could if you had the <LAUGH-money_you_could_do_something_every_night> <LAUGH> <SIL> it's 
it's better in terms <SIL> of the uh <VOCNOISE> city government <SIL> seems to the people seem to be more aware of what they're doing and it's not <VOCNOISE> oh well i'll just do this it's kind of like you know <VOCNOISE> there's some brains down there <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i'm a democrat and i've never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon <VOCNOISE> and i always <SIL> adored mark hatfield <LAUGH-I_didn't_vote_for_him_while_I_was_out_there> was the weirdest thing <VOCNOISE> because i thought he was a great <LAUGH-Republican> <LAUGH> <SIL> but i think uh personally mike coleman <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was good i <VOCNOISE> i've met uh well <LAUGH> we had a diamond jubilee at the village and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and coleman and teater both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i didn't think that <CUTOFF-bi=big> <VOCNOISE> there was much that much difference in them <ERROR-idalogically=ideologically> <VOCNOISE> i think yknow she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> in terms of having a black mayor i think that's good for columbus <SIL> i <CUTOFF-thi=think> <IVER>
i hope so yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
hm oh that's a real major <LAUGH-question_isn't_it> <VOCNOISE> uh hm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i don't think it's too bad <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> uh well we could go into the issue of uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the columbus board of education what's his name <VOCNOISE> he is always <IVER>
moss <LAUGH> <LAUGH-Bill_Moss> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-he's_always_saying> <VOCNOISE> oh this is <ERROR-rashist=racist> and that's <ERROR-rashist=racist> but i don't <VOCNOISE> think <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's too bad in columbus <VOCNOISE> i know there're places lots <ERROR-worths=worse> <VOCNOISE> like the south and so on <VOCNOISE> course <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh who who really knows <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the race issue is such a big question <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i like him personally and when he was running for uh mayor i would have voted for him i met him and everything but i guess he just is <VOCNOISE> plays the devil's <CUTOFF-a=advocate> advocate all the time at the uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the um school board meetings i i heard this is just a <CUTOFF-rum=rumor> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you want gossip in here <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-you> want some gossip <VOCNOISE> the gossip i heard was that um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> the superintendent of schools said that if <LAUGH-he_was_reelected_she_was_going_to_resign_and_so_they_gave_her_a_big_raise> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-so_he_she_must_be_a_thorn_in_her_side> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah he was he's gonna always be reelected he's got his <CUTOFF-gr=group> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i <SIL> uh his wife's a teacher and i understand an excellent teacher so i think he has real good information <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> that he works with <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well i think she maybe <CUTOFF-res=resigned> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> retired last year but she had <CUTOFF-a=?> <CUTOFF-uh=?> taught <VOCNOISE> columbus for twenty years or something like that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so i think his information is good <SIL> but i guess <LAUGH> <LAUGH-the> way <LAUGH-he> handles things sometimes gets <LAUGH-through-to-people> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> he always has <IVER>
whenever he <CUTOFF-run=runs> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well i thought he was gonna be elected uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> mayor too but he didn't there but i don't know what that was about but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> yknow he's got his <ERROR-constintuats=constituants> and their gonna reelect him because he stands up for the minority <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think he what he <VOCNOISE> <SIL> makes a mistake is saying labeling things racist that are not <CUTOFF-ne=necessarily> <SIL> necessarily racist but anyway <IVER>
um hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> maybe we're beyond that <SIL> we shouldn't <VOCNOISE> always be saying <LAUGH-that> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
well <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's i don't know <CUTOFF-wha=what> <CUTOFF-e=?> <CUTOFF-ih=?> <SIL> how to explain that <LAUGH-especially_if_anybody's_gonna_listen> to this <SIL> um <SIL> i had a friend that taught classes <SIL> human potential classes <SIL> was very interested <SIL> and participated very in depth in the human potential movement <SIL> so um uh <SIL> a a gentleman by the name of alexander everett <SIL> uh who <VOCNOISE> really is the father of the human potential movement <SIL> moved out there and he was gonna have <SIL> a group of people work out there and uh <SIL> and he said that <SIL> yknow i was qualified well when we got out there it just fell through <SIL> yknow and we all just lived our lives <VOCNOISE> but i was glad that <SIL> yknow that he got me out there <LAUGH-because_I_adored_it> <LAUGH> i <CUTOFF-d=just?> <SIL> i just loved it out there <IVER>
oh it's just so <CUTOFF-everyth=everything> the environment of course is <SIL> incredibly beautiful <SIL> um <SIL> and <SIL> everybody is more uh <SIL> i think <SIL> more open <SIL> or <SIL> more receptive to relationships <SIL> and um <SIL> yknow <SIL> i think it's a <CUTOFF-frie=friendly> much friendlier place and then uh i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just don't have poverty <SIL> well <SIL> if anybody's in poverty in oregon it's because they've chosen to live <SIL> a simple life it's not a <SIL> yknow because they can't get jobs and things like that although the <LAUGH-economy_in_Oregon> is not that great but yknow <VOCNOISE> they say in eugene <VOCNOISE> that even the dishwashers have p h d's they <LAUGH> well the the um <VOCNOISE> the level of <VOCNOISE> the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah they have a lot of <SIL> <CUTOFF-w=well?> <SIL> educated people who aren't out to just make a bunch of money so it <SIL> makes for an very intellectual <SIL> interesting <SIL> environment <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> people are trying to live simply there <SIL> and i kind of agree with that <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> well <SIL> i don't know <LAUGH> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh well <SIL> in oregon well <SIL> i was down in california for three months and uh <SIL> and uh i went to the <CUTOFF-v=vegetable?> <SIL> produce stand and i took my umbrella <SIL> and of course it doesn't rain too <LAUCH-much_in> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-California> <SIL> and i said <SIL> oh i'm from oregon and i always think it's gonna rain and he says well i'm from washington and i know <LAUGH-it's_gonna_rain> <IVER>
<LAUGH> but uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> well something's happening of course to the planet on uh <SIL> weather patterns and uh there been having droughts in oregon which is so strange <VOCNOISE> but when i was there it <SIL> it um <SIL> it rains from november through june it rains i mean <CUTOFF-tha=they> <CUTOFF-the=they> <CUTOFF-the=they> <CUTOFF-the=they> they say on the weather in the morning <SIL> showers changing to rain and then <LAUGH-the_next_day_they> say <LAUGH-rain_changing_to_showers> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-and_it_does_have> <VOCNOISE> but they don't use umbrellas i mean they just go through it they're just so used to it and they wear that kind of jacket yknow uh no <VOCNOISE> because it's not a hard rain <SIL> and the first year i was there it was pretty hard to get used to it but there's no cold real cold winter <SIL> and uh <SIL> and then from <SIL> july <SIL> august september and october's just gorgeous <SIL> just so gorgeous <VOCNOISE> but i like <SIL> i like that fog and that <SIL> mist and those evergreen <LAUGH-trees> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
it <CUTOFF-i=is> <SIL> it is <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> or you could do <SIL> the university of oregon it's a very nice very small university but it's nice <SIL> <NOISE> <IVER>
i forget the name well i don't think there's a university of portland but there's two <SIL> two or yes there is a university i can't think of which one it is <SIL> right now <SIL> speaking of opinions did you see the paper today about the thing in seattle they're having this big <CUTOFF-dre=?> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-big_fights> and 
<IVER>
it's like oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
well i haven't read enough to know i <SIL> i saw uh <SIL> uh <SIL> uh preliminary thing that they were going to protest <SIL> and uh <SIL> but i don't <CUTOFF-a=?> i'm not <SIL> <CUTOFF-w=?> informed enough to give an opinion <LAUGH-on_that> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-r=?> i don't <CUTOFF-I=I?> that <CUTOFF-mi=might?> i think that that what they were protesting was that they weren't <CUTOFF-ge=getting> being <CUTOFF-i=involved> involved in it wasn't that part of their protest <IVER>
they weren't being represented <SIL> i don't know <SIL> i'll have to read <SIL> i didn't read <SIL> paper yet <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
no did you <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's probably because put your ad it was in the paper in the summer when we weren't <LAUGH-doing_anything_and_wanted_something_to_do> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> now we're busy <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh <SIL> i have just the same opinion i think most people have as the tv <IVER>
i mean i <SIL> i i mean that probably can be proven i don't know if anybody would do any <SIL> decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that <SIL> yknow it would be the influence of tv <SIL> yknow the <SIL> and then <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> another thing that's <SIL> well tv is the <CUTOFF-in=influence> <SIL> uh <SIL> where it comes from but like the kids are all into pokemon right now <IVER>
and it uh they have these fads that go through and somebody asked me my opinion about the pokemon i said oh brother <SIL> yknow <SIL> it couldn't be any worse than what was those turtles that lived in the <LAUGH-sewers> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-ni=ninja> ninja <LAUGH-turtles> <SIL> well the kids went into that just so <SIL> <CUTOFF-intensivel=intensively> <SIL> and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean what uh the visual <SIL> was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these masks <NOISE> and hoods <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and they fought a lot <SIL> and there was lot of violence <SIL> and then <SIL> i love walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i <SIL> i swear i haven't seen a walt disney movie that doesn't have violence in it <IVER>
i mean just like beauty and the beast there's extreme amount of violence in there <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow just every one there's a <CUTOFF-b=bad> <SIL> a bad dark side in the story so <SIL> children just are <CUTOFF-su=so> and i mean it's <SIL> in their <SIL> <CUTOFF-the=they> <SIL> and then <SIL> including my own daughter she <SIL> and i'd swear <SIL> i had her watch mister <LAUGH-Rogers_all_the_time> <LAUGH> but <CUTOFF-sh=she> <SIL> now that she's older she watches tv <SIL> she's addicted to <CUTOFF=d=tv> <SIL> tv something terrible and then so of course her children are <SIL> uh <SIL> so <SIL> but i think <SIL> yknow <SIL> i was <SIL> i didn't have <LAUGH-have> tv when i was a child child <SIL> and i think <SIL> yknow it <SIL> it stimulates the imagination in some ways but i don't know what direction that imagination really goes yknow <SIL> and <SIL> <CUTOFF-d=?> but there's a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody's face anymore <SIL> as matter of fact i'm getting so i don't watch the news <IVER>
i dislike i can't take any more of it <IVER>
<LAUGH> i seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder <SIL> it's like the same thing <SIL> over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> the yeah <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
yeah huh huh huh huh <IVER>
yeah <SIL> you <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ne=?> <SIL> uh i <SIL> yknow i've just come to <VOCNOISE> i always you know prefer for my children <NOISE> and <NOISE> myself i mean uh if there's anything <CUTOFF-d=Disney> <SIL> disney i usually go and watch it yknow at the movie theater <SIL> and after a while it's like <SIL> i think beauty and the beast is where it really came through to me it's like <SIL> that's a wonderful story but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it <IVER>
and the <CUTOFF-w=way> way disney sells i think is they do have beautiful music <IVER>
but then <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> it's like it <SIL> some <SIL> evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle <SIL> and then you go you can't stop and not watch that you <LAUGH-know> you <CUTOFF-ca=can't> <SIL> and if i was in charge of it i'd cut some of it out it's <LAUGH-not_that_important> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-s=so?> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um hum <CUTOFF-y=yeah?> <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
no asking each other opinions or anything like <IVER>
no kind of <VOCNOISE> of <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yknow <SIL> uh <SIL> it <CUTOFF-i=it> it just seems like our <SIL> uh society just has that <SIL> you have to <SIL> be <SIL> just horrible to a person because they're bad well <SIL> you and i know that a bad person doesn't become better by being bad to them <IVER>
<LAUGH> yknow what i <CUTOFF-mea=mean> <SIL> it's uh <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> we're i hope we're getting to the place we know that <SIL> that uh <IVER>
we'd <SIL> we don't necessarily overcome bad by bad we're still very much in that framework of reference in this <SIL> on this <LAUGH-particular_planet> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
okay <NOISE> drooping down <IVER>
<NOISE> okay <IVER>
<NOISE> i'm <CUTOFF-ta=talking> bouncing around too much <IVER>
um hum <NOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> <NOISE> okay <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> that's our planet <IVER>
um hum hum hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um yeah <IVER>
yes <IVER>
uh <SIL> well i'm very much <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-m=my> <SIL> my baseline philosophy is thou shalt not kill and that goes really a long ways for me that includes uh <VOCNOISE> being a vegetarian <SIL> and uh <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> uh <SIL> most of our wars i would have <LAUGH> <LAUGH-said> <LAUGH-no> <LAUGH-let's> <LAUGH-not> <LAUGH-do> <LAUGH-this> yet <SIL> although on the other hand i <SIL> i have to admit that <SIL> there has been some stuff that we haven't been able to stop without it <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and <CUTOFF-na=that's> <SIL> and that's too bad yknow that <SIL> things things are <SIL> have been that bad in some <SIL> like <SIL> oh world war two <CUTOFF-th=the?> <SIL> i mean <SIL> we didn't really have any choice there not that <VOCNOISE> but uh <SIL> some of the <SIL> some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh <SIL> so but <SIL> yknow you can get you can get a philosophy but it doesn't have always apply every single <VOCNOISE> case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment the <VOCNOISE> the guy that they um <SIL> uh executed here in ohio last <CUTOFF-s=summer?> <SIL> fall did you know about it <SIL> you <CUTOFF-p=probably?> 
if you weren't here well <VOCNOISE> he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in ah <SIL> twenty or twenty-five years or something like that and he killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed <VOCNOISE> and i thought that's a cop-out if there ever was one just to <SIL> give him a lethal injection and let him go <SIL> he should have rotted in prison for <LAUGH> no that's not a punishment <VOCNOISE> he was off his rocker <VOCNOISE> there isn't anybody who murders who isn't insane <IVER>
yknow technically there's insanity and there isn't insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who isn't insane <SIL> and uh <SIL> just to <SIL> to <SIL> knock them out <SIL> is <SIL> is not appropriate <SIL> they need to be <SIL> we need to try to <SIL> save them <SIL> i mean <SIL> not in the terms of a christian saving but <SIL> uh <SIL> to make them work that off <SIL> and uh <SIL> face it <SIL> and come <SIL> in their <SIL> own mind to their own guilt <SIL> and um <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> um <SIL> so <SIL> i got two sides to that once they need to work <SIL> because they did it and the other side is <SIL> if we keep uh <SIL> i <CUTOFF-a=?> <SIL> i believe in the <CUTOFF-ca=cause?> <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-l=law?> <SIL> uh reincarnation and the law of cause and effect <SIL> and if a person murders somebody they need they'll they will pay for that later there's no question about that in the next life <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> also i think that they should be made to face their <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> their guilt and what they've done and and <SIL> a lot of them don't they say that hardened criminals <SIL> real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <CUTOFF-who=whole> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well what um what my opinion on our whole penal system is just <SIL> yknow <SIL> well it goes along with not <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=?> kind of neglecting the kids in our schools <ERROR-tright=right> now and we're definitely <CUTOFF-ne=neglecting> <SIL> neglecting criminals they need to have <SIL> be educated and <SIL> and worked with <SIL> i mean they need to obviously they some place some point they've <SIL> uh learned <SIL> incorrect <SIL> reasoning or whatever you call it and and they need to uh <SIL> they need to have psychological help <VOCNOISE> period <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-e=evolution> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
that's where we are in our <LAUGH-evolution_on_this_planet> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> there's a lot <SIL> we need to do a lot of evolving <LAUGH> <SIL> we <LAUGH-definitely> do <IVER>
um-hum hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i don't know uh in <SIL> <CUTOFF-we=well> <SIL> i don't <SIL> uh for a while we got it stopped the <VOCNOISE> thing that <SIL> is <SIL> uh <SIL> confusing to me <SIL> is that sometimes we'll get something stopped for twenty five <SIL> or <SIL> thirty years or ten or fifteen <SIL> and then we go back it's like hey we got moved ourselves out of that <SIL> why are we going back to it now <SIL> um <SIL> and and i think <SIL> yknow the papers keep saying that our <CUTOFF-cri=criminal> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> crime rate is going down and everything <SIL> and so <SIL> uh <SIL> i think that's because we <SIL> some people are <SIL> yknow trying to make it <VOCNOISE> deal with these people as people the who are ill or are sick and try to help them with their <SIL> you <VOCNOISE> yknow it took us a long time to figure out that <SIL> alcoholism is a disease okay and uh so now we try to help <CUTOFF-a=alcoholics> alcoholics <SIL> well well <SIL> <CUTOFF-ug=?> certainly <LAUGH-murdering_is_a> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-dis=disease> <LAUGH-serious_illness_that_needs_to_be> <SIL> helped not <EXT-just> yknow <SIL> um <SIL> well stick them in a <VOCNOISE> place where they can just concentrate on it even more <SIL> so <SIL> we got a long ways to go there <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um yeah <IVER>
yeah anger <SIL> it's always anger <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <SIL> i'll have a <CUTOFF-r=?> <LAUGH> maybe when i <SIL> i'm a hundred i'll have that figured out <IVER>
because i went to oregon <SIL> and of course <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the greater part of the population out there are more <SIL> socialists than they are capitalists and they're easier to deal with and they're more reasonable people in my <LAUGH-opinion_much_more_reasonable> <VOCNOISE> but then i come back to columbus and all my family and and <SIL> and all <SIL> i'm the minority in my family <LAUGH> <LAUGH-believe_me> <LAUGH> and uh <SIL> they're very in to capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so <NOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> so um <SIL> it seems <SIL> the picture is kind of <VOCNOISE> hard to deal with people that are in to capitalism have <SIL> a <SIL> <CUTOFF-p=pretty> <SIL> pretty good lives <SIL> and they have what they want and they don't uh <CUTFF-s=seem> seem to have such serious problems so <VOCNOISE> people who try to go against that current can get it theirselves into big trouble <SIL> so <SIL> and capitalism has made the united states go i mean it has worked <SIL> uh and we are ahead of the world there's no question about that and what the individual people <SIL> persons have and how their lives go much better <SIL> on the other hand <SIL> um <SIL> yknow i'm <SIL> i'm actually what i would like <SIL> <CUTOFF-fo=for> <SIL> uh <SIL> if it would just spread all over the world <VOCNOISE> true communism <IVER>
true communism <SIL> not as it was practiced in russia but <SIL> uh <SIL> where people <SIL> um share and uh <SIL> share power and share money and <SIL> equally but with the where we are in our evolution that we're not ready for it <CUTOFF-I=I> <LAUGH> actually i <CUTOFF-lib=lived> when i was in oregon i did a lot of experimenting and i lived in an intentional community which was <SIL> actually <SIL> trying <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> to <SIL> <CUTOFF-di=?> we never used the word <LAUGH-ever> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> i'm sure plenty of people used the word <LAUGH-on_us_you_know> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but we <CUTOFF-tr=tried> uh we shared everything <SIL> that we had <SIL> and <SIL> supposedly <SIL> we had a true <SIL> uh <SIL> sharing <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> in terms of government i don't <SIL> we weren't ready for that because we had more of a matriarchy <SIL> one woman who was <VOCNOISE> decisive and made <SIL> decisions and we would <LAUGH> <LAUGH-go_along_with_her_yknow> <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> if a <SIL> if a <SIL> we could get ourselves to the place where it would work <SIL> that would be great <SIL> and i would <SIL> very <CUTOFF-mu=much> and i <SIL> then in the year that i lived in that community was one of the <CUTOFF-b=best> <SIL> best years of my life <SIL> it was <IVER>
um <SIL> the reason <SIL> that it was one of the best years of my life is <VOCNOISE> it's in a <CUTOFF-k=?> <SIL> incredibly beautiful setting <SIL> and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people <SIL> and it was mostly of course young people but they were <SIL> incredibly <SIL> idealistic <SIL> and <SIL> incredibly searching for answers <SIL> in <SIL> um <SIL> i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions <LAUGH> as a matter of fact the that's only thing i <ERROR-felten=felt> <SIL> difficult about <SIL> about living there was <VOCNOISE> they would be asking all these <LAUGH-incredible_questions_and_I_would_be> trying to <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-do_the_dishes_or_something_mundane_like> that it's like <SIL> i don't want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions 
<VOCNOISE> and the <VOCNOISE> um that was <SIL> part of the process there to how to work work and work <SIL> up there too with people <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> if we could just share more <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i would be a lot happier <SIL> <IVER>
mm yeah <VOCNOISE> i hope we're gonna get there <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<ERROR-moh=oh> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah it's gonna have to be from the bottom up i think <VOCNOISE> and everybody keeps and i <CUTOFF-ge=get> i'm just getting a kick out of all the advertisements and everything they're coming <SIL> with two thousand on it <SIL> well i'm hoping <SIL> people are making a big deal and making a big advertisement and selling a lot of stuff because of it but i'm hoping <SIL> that it <SIL> does mean <CUTOFF-peop=people> since people are so focused on it does mean a shift in consciousness i hope <SIL> uh <SIL> y two k i don't know what that really stands for <LAUGH> i have to think of some words there but <SIL> yknow i hope uh since everybody is just <SIL> making it into a big deal that maybe it will be a big deal <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah yeah <LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> there's always people out there <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> actually i wore out <IVER>
i sort of wore out <SIL> um <SIL> that <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> just <SIL> oh there were two reasons i left one i was getting <SIL> exhausted <SIL> and uh <SIL> it was just <SIL> so demanding <SIL> and <SIL> we didn't know as a community how to let <CUTOFF-o=off> <SIL> uh up <SIL> <LAUGH-so_I_had_to> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-had_to> <SIL> i had to withdraw <SIL> another thing was <SIL> i'm very into um <SIL> metaphysics <SIL> and studying and meditating we had no time whatsoever everybody was <VOCNOISE> in there <SIL> um <SIL> that's one disagreement i have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in january so there's always people <SIL> coming for <SIL> four <SIL> or five days <SIL> and you have <LAUGH-to_explain_everything_in_life_to_them_in_four_or_five_days> <SIL> and plus we <SIL> uh lived in um <SIL> a <SIL> a rural setting where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant <SIL> and a hardware and had a mail route <SIL> and then we had all these visitors and then we and then we <SIL> uh made our own bread and we <SIL> uh <SIL> milked a cow <LAUGH-and_uh> <LAUGH> so it's just <CUTOFF-p=plain> plain <SIL> hard physical work <SIL> plus all the mental <SIL> um stuff of dealing with people's really big questions <SIL> it <CUTOFF-wa=was> <SIL> it was <LAUGH-intense> <LAUGH> yknow so that's the reason i had to quit is was <SIL> like <SIL> if i could <SIL> leave this situation for a month or six weeks <SIL> and get caught up within myself <SIL> i would have been okay but <SIL> that wasn't how it worked <SIL> so had to <SIL> to pull back from it <LAUGH> <IVER>
uh uh uh <SIL> i have one daughter thirty six years old <SIL> she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren <IVER>
um-hum yeah um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
no not often <SIL> uh my daughter has a very um <SIL> intense life <LAUGH> and uh <SIL> so um <SIL> i don't see them near as often as i like <SIL> right we just do a one day thing <SIL> because it's fairly easy to drive to toledo so i go <SIL> real early in the morning <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> uh spend six or seven hours with them and then come back <SIL> and or she does the same thing she comes down here <SIL> and we just do the one <CUTOFF-thi=thing> <SIL> day thing now because of the children she worries about the children and blah blah blah <LAUGH-blah_you_know_so> <SIL> it's better to stick <SIL> home <SIL> so i know what they're doing and everything but i don't <SIL> i'm not <NOISE> the old fashioned grandmother <IVER>
um <SIL> i'd like to be yknow but she lives i keep telling her <LAUGH-I_wish_she'd> move down here but i'm not moving <LAUGH-to_Toledo> <LAUGH> i don't like toledo <LAUGH> <IVER>
uh <SIL> i don't know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but <SIL> um <SIL> but it's not that i it's i don't like it as well as columbus <SIL> at all <NOISE> <SIL> mainly i suppose because of the university <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i've given you plenty of opinions haven't i <SIL> i've just loaded them on you <SIL> okay <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> i just have a question <SIL> is <SIL> do you <SIL> is this a research project for a private organization or is it <SIL> <IVER>
uh huh <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
okay <SIL> i bet i'll go home and i'll wonder and wonder and wonder about this <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<IVER>

<SIL> <EXCLUDE-one_two_three_four_five_one_two_three_four_five> <SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<HES-um> i'm originally from columbus <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-and> <HES-um> <SIL> i'm an event coordinator for <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> which is <EXT-a> <VOCNOISE> excellent caterer <SIL> in german village <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm <SIL> forty three years old i've just been married uh <SIL> three years i have no children <SIL> uh <SIL> i've lived in columbus most of my life although i have i went to school in atlanta <VOCNOISE> and i also lived in orlando florida <SIL> i used to have a uh interior plantscape business <VOCNOISE> and that's why i moved to florida <VOCNOISE> for <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i'm really interested in <VOCNOISE> horticulture interior design <SIL> botany <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but when i did move back from columbus i was amazed with all the <VOCNOISE> just in a five year span how <SIL> much had grown and <SIL> i think it's a really <VOCNOISE> good city to live in i think it's really <VOCNOISE> progressed well and <SIL> i enjoy living here <IVER>
uh <CUTOFF-s=six> <SIL> six years ago <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
five years <IVER>
amazing how much the growth in delaware and different areas when <VOCNOISE> i was growing up here and how marysville and it was such a farm <SIL> town <VOCNOISE> um just <SIL> the growth of the <SIL> different cities and suburbs of <SIL> columbus is amazing and the <VOCNOISE> housing and <IVER>
shopping <SIL> you know <SIL> but it's just become a really good <VOCNOISE> metropolitan city i mean it's on it's way <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yep <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> now with easton i think it's really helped <VOCNOISE> with columbus and <VOCNOISE> yknow i think it's just gonna get better and better <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yes <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
columbus needs that as much people don't want other things to close i just feel we have to keep <SIL> we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i don't think that's <SIL> really fair to them <IVER>
hm <IVER>
oh yeah that's beautiful <SIL> yeah <IVER>
it's nice they have a real nice arts festival every spring <SIL> if you ever get a chance go down in march <IVER>

and i did have a very serious relationship in florida <VOCNOISE> uh he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew <VOCNOISE> he wanted children and i <VOCNOISE> never wanted children unfortunately <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i love <VOCNOISE> animals and things but i just <SIL> never decided i never wanted children and i knew <VOCNOISE> he eventually would so <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i was engaged to him but i decide to <IVER>
break it off because i didn't think that was fair <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think anymore though with the <SIL> women <SIL> are more powerful and i think they they're finally making yknow good money and <VOCNOISE> used to be women needed men to take care of them <VOCNOISE> and they weren't as <SIL> much in the work force <SIL> yknow i think things have changed really <VOCNOISE> in the last <VOCNOISE-ten> years <VOCNOISE> yknow in the <VOCNOISE-eighties_still> yes <VOCNOISE> yknow there was definitely a point in my life where i was like oh am i ever gonna meet anybody and <VOCNOISE> all my friends honestly <VOCNOISE> most of them were all <NOISE-married> <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> i enjoyed being single <VOCNOISE> and i never really felt the <VOCNOISE> the urge just to get married to get married <VOCNOISE> and i'm i'm glad of that <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
neither was i <NOISE> i really wasn't and <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> it's funny i just <VOCNOISE> this summer went to my twenty fifth <VOCNOISE> uh high school reunion <IVER>
and there were several couples who got married <VOCNOISE> 
<SIL> right after high school <SIL> i think there was probably f <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'll say six <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and amazingly <SIL> uh <SIL> well <SIL> three were still together <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it was nice uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just seeing that and you could tell they were still in love and everything and <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> one of them had four children one had like six yknow i mean it was amazing because i thought i bet they're not still married <VOCNOISE> getting right out of high school i just wasn't interested in that when i was in high school at all <SIL> yknow i was ready to go out into the world <SIL> and these girls who get married so young they just have no clue about life <IVER>
you know <IVER>
you know i think a lot of it depends on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know if it's different parts of the country but cultures and everything <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because you know <SIL> it just seems in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah some parts of the midwest but maybe <SIL> kentucky and west virginia seems girls down there <SIL> a lot them get married so young they just that's just <SIL> what they want to do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they don't but they're not thinking <SIL> of any future <SIL> wanting to go to college or anything like that <SIL> have to cough is that okay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm sorry <NOISE> <LAUGH> i didn't want <VOCNOISE> be like <SIL> <IVER>
<IVER>
you'll you'll know it's me by the cough <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> no <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i have a beautiful niece i love her to death <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i knew at a young age <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and actually <SIL> wanted to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> make it a permanent decision but doctors at that time wouldn't do it i was like twenty five and i knew <NOISE> no they wouldn't even consider it they said you'll change your mind <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i knew i just never felt a mother instinct <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it's <SIL> funny <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh yesterday actually last night we went to visit a friend of ours had a baby <SIL> yesterday <SIL> two days ago <SIL> <SIL> <SIL> and when we left the room and she has a two year old child and now another <VOCNOISE> <SIL> little girl <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i said derek you know <NOISE> it's <SIL> it's nice to go in there and see that <SIL> but i just have no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> motherly instinct <SIL> towards <SIL> you know they're all like oh eric you should have one and yknow and he knows <LAUGH-knows_I'm_not_going_to_have_one> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i just knew at a young age i've always loved the animals <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and i <SIL> it just i know it sounds crazy but i'd rather have ten animals and take care of them and different kinds of animals <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> than children i don't know why <SIL> i knew at a very young age <SIL> that i <VOCNOISE> wasn't important to me it wouldn't be a part of my life <SIL> <IVER>
they wouldn't <SIL> no <SIL> i <NOISE> went to two different <SIL> doctors and they said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you possibly will change your mind and <SIL> yknow i was single <SIL> um maybe if i would have been married they might have <VOCNOISE> considered it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> but <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> said no way would they do it <SIL> and we're talking fifteen years ago <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
isn't that amazing <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well it probably would have been <SIL> yeah <SIL> but they felt that i would change <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <SIL> i've also been a vegetarian for twenty two years <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when i first decided to do that everyone said oh you'll <SIL> change wait until you get married you'll you know and i don't eat any animals at all <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it's <SIL> it was just a conscious <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> decision <IVER>
<SIL> i'm <SIL> i never liked meat my parents always made me eat it once i went away to college <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i said i'm i'm not going to eat anymore and they're like oh <SIL> well we'll see <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i've never eat <SIL> <NOISE> eaten <NOISE> anything since <IVER>
<SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i've always felt good about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> people always said <SIL> <VOCNOISE> oh you don't even crave yknow what like a wendy's hamburger and all this stuff <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and once you make a decision like that you don't crave things like that you don't even <SIL> think about it <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> and i yknow they said well what if uh <SIL> for health reason they said you'd have to eat meat there's no way someone could tell me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that i would have to eat meat <SIL> <SIL> yknow <IVER>
to make me healthier or whatever because i've always been really healthy <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
there is <IVER>
there didn't used to be and especially in restaurants and everything and now it's such an open market and they know that they have to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> accommodate <SIL> every um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> body's taste <SIL> yknow i mean before no i'd have to go in to a restaurant and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> salad and baked potato yknow i mean there was nothing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> really nothing unless i go to a buffet and then all the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> food's so cooked down i mean honestly <VOCNOISE> yknow it's like no nutritional value <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no i knew i wouldn't change my mind on that either i'm pretty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> strong willed about <NOISE> <LAUGH-things> <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> and you know what i cook meat for my husband <SIL> i really don't cook <SIL> red meat <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because he's on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups <SIL> a lot of good soups for him with meat <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it really doesn't bother me to cook it <SIL> yknow i'm not go sit home make a roast every night <IVER>
but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he's limited his meat a little bit more but with men it's a lot harder <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think <SIL> yknow when they're <VOCNOISE> used to you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> meat and potato kind of families <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but like thanksgiving it just doesn't mean that much to me <SIL> i <SIL> i the family thing does but yknow the turkey <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-and_all_that> <SIL> we i don't cook it very often my sister we used to go to my sister's <IVER>
house <SIL> because she enjoys cooking and <SIL> makes it a little bit easier i tend to overcook the meat <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
you know i haven't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> i haven't tried that <SIL> no <SIL> no i eat tofu a little bit but not really that much and i probably <CUTOFF-sit=should> <SIL> should i've <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> tended to more to soy products <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and there's so much nutritional value and especially for women <SIL> yknow i think it's <SIL> <IVER>
really <SIL> um-hum <SIL> i think it's really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all these women <SIL> i know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> and they should <SIL> and very rarely do doctors even ask you about allergies <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> more and more and people don't even realize and they get sick so often <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they need to ask about allergies <SIL> <VOCNOISE> or even just have a little minor test that they can take <SIL> when people when they can't figure out what's wrong with them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because a lot of times it is allergic reactions to things they've eaten <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> or been around <SIL> you know but um <SIL> more <SIL> i think doctors should more <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> look on that avenue <SIL> yknow <SIL> that possibly it's something else like that <SIL> i've never had a doc well now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you know about allergies and usually it's um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> prescriptions and things <SIL> you know i mean that you've taken but <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think a lot of things have to do with food allergies anymore <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i really do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yep <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well for so long i <SIL> ate peanuts and i loved them and peanut butter and then two years ago i started getting a reaction from it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> finally i did go to the doctor because i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i was so ill from it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um and he said you're allergic <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> mainly it was the skins on <SIL> like spanish peanuts and things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i never but <SIL> my body must have built up <SIL> this reaction to it because i i was always fine eating them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then they really <SIL> turned on me so now i can't even eat <SIL> any <VOCNOISE> <SIL> peanut products <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or the oil because everybody's like well you can eat natural peanut butter and i'm like <SIL> no it's the oil in there you know they grind up the peanuts and it's the oil <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i probably had it for a long time and i was <SIL> getting sick and thinking i had the flu or something and he <IVER>
yknow i didn't realize because i used to love peanut butter <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you want toast and crackers i'd go home you know was <VOCNOISE> because it was a lot of protein for me not eating meat and it <SIL> yknow it kind of satisfied me <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <VOCNOISE> this doctor <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> took a couple tests <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he realized it was the peanuts which i would have never thought of that <SIL> because i ate it for so long <SIL> all my life <IVER>
yes <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
see and i can't eat seafood <UNKNOWN> but i <SIL> tried some once when i went to las vegas with my <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i <SIL> we didn't really have it <SIL> my mom didn't cook it at home <SIL> which i'm kind glad she didn't <SIL> um <SIL> the <SIL> smell of fish always kind of bothered me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> until i tried some crab meat and lobster <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and within five minutes <SIL> i broke out into a rash <SIL> i mean it was like a heat rash <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> oh <SIL> it started on my neck <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
is it okay i'm sorry <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
it started on my neck and went down <VOCNOISE> but it was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> automatic <SIL> and i mean they had to take me the emergency room i didn't know what it was until <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it was <SIL> and i mean you get so hot and you <VOCNOISE> you just <VOCNOISE> you're in a fever <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
so i haven't been able to eat that but <SIL> luckily my husband he's allergic too <VOCNOISE> 
<IVER>
it's salt water fish <IVER>
he can eat fresh water <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um but no see and i would have never <SIL> yknow <SIL> you don't know until you get a reaction like that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i had a cat that just died <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> sixteen <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> wow <IVER>

<IVER>
we want a dog and we've kinda been waiting <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> but i like both animals <IVER>
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i like seeing them grow up together and <IVER>
i love kittens and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow i <VOCNOISE> but i'm gonna wait <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> we're not sure um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we're looking to <SIL> uh we rent now and we're looking to buy house <IVER>
probably <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> northwest area <IVER>
actually <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i live in clintonville now and it's real convenient but <VOCNOISE> the houses are so old and <SIL> i'm just tired of living in an old <LAUGH-house> <IVER>
they're nice but <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-huh <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
that's perfect <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
see that's how my husband was they didn't have a pet growing up <IVER>
and i just can't imagine i had dogs and cats <VOCNOISE> we did and i loved it <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> i just think kids need that and it's just <SIL> a different kind of love i think <SIL> yknow they learn from it and <SIL> <IVER>
you look forward to coming home yknow and the pets waiting <LAUGH-on <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
hm <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
hm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's great <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh is he <IVER>
well my husband was allergic when <SIL> we first got together but i hafta admit <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> it's <SIL> it's <SIL> they well he went <SIL> he goes to <CUTOFF> <SIL> he has other allergies <SIL> um <SIL> so he gets shots and things but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow they always say it's the pet dander <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh eventually he <SIL> he was alright with it <VOCNOISE> he got used to it <IVER>
um <SIL> i've always heard and i'm <VOCNOISE> i'm very clean anyways but yknow when you hafta vacuum a lot and everything and you're constantly picking up that dander rather than just let it sit and accumulate <IVER>
um <SIL> but they always say don't let the animals sleep with you and all that and with a cat and they curl up with you <SIL> it's hard to say <LAUGH-get <LAUGH> no but you know what <VOCNOISE> honestly <VOCNOISE> eventually <SIL> well it it took probably a year <IVER>
he stopped sneezing <IVER>
yknow he did sneeze but he knew i wasn't gonna get rid the cat i'd had her she was my daughter <IVER>
and so <SIL> eventually he did he's <SIL> and <SIL> he just got used to her <SIL> <IVER>
and he always said well i'm so allergic but <SIL> but then he didn't have any problems um-hum <IVER>
now when he goes to my sister's house and she <UNKNOWN> <SIL> has three cats and he's not around <VOCNOISE> <SIL> them <SIL> <IVER>
then when we leave his eyes are itching and <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> i mean so it is true <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> with different <SIL> pets <IVER>
but <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yes <VOCNOISE> you're right <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh i'm sure <IVER>
<IVER>
no <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> we have that many animals yknow people <IVER>

things yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> collecting but <SIL> it's hard <SIL> with my sister's cats because she has a little girl and no she didn't go home and vacuum every day <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <IVER>
i think when you have <LAUGH-two_or_more> <UNKNOWN> <LAUGH> <SIL> pets you hafta make a little bit more effort <SIL> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> i just didn't wanna do that a lot of people do that but yknow <NOISE> it's just such an investment then when you leave and <IVER>
but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i really enjoy that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> wow that's great <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
oh they're beautiful <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <IVER>
yes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but that's great though <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well that's great <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
definitely <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <IVER>
yes <IVER>
yep <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <VOCNOISE> yknow columbus is so saturated with golf courses and my parents all through growing up <SIL> they played golf and <SIL> i really was interested in it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i just think enoughs enough so <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> yeah <SIL> <UNKNOWN> there's so many but <IVER>
i have to admit <CUTOFF-eh <SIL> when we go to try play golf sometimes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and not have a tee <NOISE> time you can't even get in <IVER>
so all over columbus they're all booked <IVER>
and so you keep thinking well <SIL> yknow they need more but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i was hoping they could use that land for something else <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> there's <SIL> yknow there's so many <SIL> not building but <SIL> yknow something maybe <SIL> especially in dublin <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's <HES-I> <HES-it's> probably it'll be good for columbus <IVER>
because i <UNKNOWN-f=?> <SIL> they feel they <VOCNOISE> have the need for it <SIL> there's so many golfers i mean that sports <VOCNOISE> <SIL> went sky high <UNKNOWN> mean when <HES-I> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my mom used to play golf <VOCNOISE> growing up and they only let them on <LAUGH-the> <LAUGH-golf> <LAUGH-course> just one day a week <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which is amazing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was like on a tuesday <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when i lived in florida a lot of the courses were like that too and i thought <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they're only allowing women one day a week <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> isn't that amazing <SIL> there's so many good women golfers now and but they said they're too slow and they always talk and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that just killed me when my mom that's the only day she could play and she wanted to play more <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so things have come a little bit <NOISE> yknow <NOISE> <SIL> better but um <SIL> there's still such restrictions with women <SIL> <IVER>
yknow in this sport especially i think golf <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
you can't <NOISE> no <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it is <SIL> but it it that was good for <SIL> new albany to have that i mean i think it <SIL> it was great to have it there and i think a lot of people <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> did enjoy going there because there's not very many women tournaments that come <SIL> around here <IVER>
yeah 
<IVER>
yes <SIL> mm-hmm <VOCNOISE> yep <IVER>
no <IVER>
<SIL> mm-hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
yep <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <SIL> wow <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
wow <SIL> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-w=well> yeah <IVER>
no i <CUTOFF-ha=had> we actually had student tickets that <SIL> people didn't want clear up in c deck <SIL> um <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but we enjoy it because <HES-we> lot times we walk and <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> i think i was at that penn state game i have a <VOCNOISE> <EXT-cousin> is a golf pro over <SIL> near <SIL> penn state <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> trying think the name of it <SIL> um <SIL> but he usually gets us tickets for that game <IVER>
yeah <SIL> mm-hmm but i've never been to happy valley i've always <SIL> wanted to go i've heard it's so nice <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you <EXT-know> <SIL> <NOISE> they're such good people every time they come here to ohio state though they were very <SIL> you know high class people and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a year that we just <NOISE> killed them here i think it was <SIL> three years ago and but they were <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean though <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they just seem very gracious because <IVER>
i think their coach is the best joe paterno is the best <SIL> <IVER>
i do he's a <IVER>
he is <IVER>
he is <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
john no <IVER>
he he's a very he's a disappointment <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> i <IVER>
think the <LAUGH-main> problem with this year was the coaching it's good that they got rid of two coaches but <VOCNOISE> his attitude i just don't think the kids <SIL> think of him as a role model and i think a coach has to be a role model <VOCNOISE> i used to work at the hyatt <SIL> on capitol square <IVER>
and that's where <VOCNOISE> the ohio state players <NOISE> i don't know if you know this <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> they stay there every night before a game <SIL> i mean it's the most expensive hotel in columbus <VOCNOISE> all the players stay there but <SIL> to my amazement they come down for a uh <VOCNOISE> i think they have a dinner then they come down for a midnight snack it's so funny all these guys come down in their shorts and stuff <IVER>
to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice <VOCNOISE> but <NOISE> but then here comes <SIL> the uh cooper's wife <SIL> and his daughter <SIL> and like his son and i'm <NOISE-thinking> <NOISE> they're putting <CUTOFF-ah=all> <SIL> all these his family up in this hotel the <NOISE-night> before a game i mean <VOCNOISE> i don't know i just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when all <SIL> none of those boys get to bring anybody you know what i mean <IVER>
and none of the other coaches did either <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but i just thought it and here they came down for the midnight snack too <SIL> and i thought <SIL> this is for the <SIL> team <SIL> you know what i mean <IVER>
i thought it was very strange <SIL> but um <IVER>
he seems pretty arrogant i don't think he's done <NOISE> very <NOISE-really> too much for columbus <SIL> they need to get a younger coach they need <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a new <IVER>
they do because he just <SIL> he's all out for <NOISE-himself> <IVER>
i just really think he is <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i know it <IVER>
and then the players said we're not getting any guidance from the coaches <IVER>
you know and they some of them <VOCNOISE> spoke out where they should speak out <IVER>
yknow <SIL> mean i liked earl bruce <SIL> and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at <VOCNOISE> he was the nicest man and when they did that i don't know if you know about that when they <VOCNOISE> fired him the day before the michigan game <VOCNOISE> for having a nine to three season three years in a row <VOCNOISE> they fired him the day before that game <IVER>
and then but the whole band and the cheerleaders went to his house <VOCNOISE> and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart wrenching <IVER>
and because of that <SIL> the um <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> athletic director that was here at the time <SIL> he quit <NOISE> because he did not want to fire them and they overruled him <IVER>
but <IVER>
the city just could not believe <IVER>
that they fired him like that the night before the <VOCNOISE> michigan game <VOCNOISE> so then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora yknow a hat <VOCNOISE> he looked so cool <VOCNOISE> yknow because joe paterno he always wears a tie i don't know he just <SIL> he he's a great coach <IVER>
yknow not that what you wear makes you but he just <VOCNOISE> he's a good role model <IVER>
cooper just <VOCNOISE> i just don't see him ever <VOCNOISE> hugging the guys or saying great job or anything <VOCNOISE> you know <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well the main thing is <SIL> they never leave <SIL> they don't they go a lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest <SIL> g p a of any college <IVER>
i mean that is an <IVER>
that is an embarrassment for a college this size <IVER>
and they have excellent <IVER>
professors and everything <VOCNOISE> but i think <SIL> yknow they get a lot of these kids and they don't care about school <SIL> but they <VOCNOISE> they leave early <VOCNOISE> because they know they can do it <IVER>
and that's so sad for our city <IVER>
it really is <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
and these guys have a free ride and then they just leave on it <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i think they should too <SIL> i do <SIL> i <NOISE-really> do <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you're right that's not fair because then that's <SIL> that's a waste <IVER>
um because there is some good athletes you look at colleges especially on the west coast like stamford i have a friend who's <SIL> from california <IVER>
his dad's a <SIL> um <SIL> a graduate of stanford <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but he is um <SIL> they they never leave there i mean that's an excellent medical school and everything but those football players they're smart they they don't <SIL> they don't quit <SIL> yknow <SIL> i mean it's amazing they <VOCNOISE> they never do <IVER>
because they like it they like school and that's why they came to college football was secondary <IVER>
but here <VOCNOISE> it's just to see yknow <VOCNOISE> how much <SIL> success you can have and then <VOCNOISE> they just want to leave <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> we looked we can look forward to the basketball season i think he's a good coach <IVER>
we needed that <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah that was very exciting <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i think it was <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i know <LAUGH> <IVER>
well because <SIL> yknow <IVER>
but then they have one injury <SIL> and then <SIL> what are they going to do <NOISE> and they got to think of that <SIL> they have a free <SIL> education and they just don't think of it that way <SIL> yknow they think they can make enough money <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
money's not everything <VOCNOISE> it's too bad sports have <VOCNOISE> ended up this way <IVER>
it does <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i know <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <SIL> i think all through growing up there's always been <SIL> yknow <SIL> different kind of kids <IVER>
i mean there's always been the nerds and <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know when i was growing up <VOCNOISE> in the seventies <SIL> there really wasn't <SIL> punk or anything like that <SIL> and <SIL> i think um <SIL> unfortunately <SIL> i mean there's always going to be all different kinds of people <SIL> to make the world but <SIL> it they just <SIL> pushed you to an extreme <VOCNOISE> certain <SIL> kinds of kids and yknow <SIL> they want a <SIL> i saw <VOCNOISE> yknow i watch all these shows dateline and twenty twenty and all this informative shows <SIL> and how one was <SIL> in texas run over <SIL> one of the punk kids was run over by a <SIL> um <SIL> a jock <IVER>
i mean actually run over and killed <IVER>
um in a fight <SIL> and they just said that we wanna be <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> looked at as just <SIL> other <SIL> kids yknow in high school <SIL> but yet when they wear make up and they spike their hair <VOCNOISE> and they have all these piercings <SIL> yknow it's like they <CUTOFF-n_ah=?> <VOCNOISE> they don't want to be like everybody else <IVER>
yknow they want to be judged as like everybody else <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i think um <SIL> they have so many different ideas <VOCNOISE> and not that either one of them's right but still um <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> i think there's always going to barrier there <SIL> they're just kids are just not all kids are going to get along <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i mean <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
i think because <SIL> of the movies <VOCNOISE> and i think of <VOCNOISE> nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does <VOCNOISE> spark things in little <SIL> children's minds and even yknow like in junior high that oh yeah we could do that <SIL> yknow and <VOCNOISE> there's just so much violence <SIL> in <SIL> when we were growing up there wasn't any violence <VOCNOISE> on tv we weren't allowed to watch it <SIL> but yknow i mean i <NOISE-mean> the comics weren't violent um <SIL> now it's too open for kids the parents <SIL> yknow they say the parents should monitor <VOCNOISE> them 
<SIL> <CUTOFF-ch=watch> on tv and in the movies <IVER>
that <SIL> that is what's making the <SIL> these kids think they <SIL> they can do it <SIL> i just really think <IVER>
i think it's too late <SIL> i do <NOISE> <SIL> i <IVER>
personally i think it's too late <SIL> because <SIL> they can get things on the internet <VOCNOISE> yknow there's just so many things <SIL> so many <VOCNOISE> avenues for them <SIL> to <SIL> find <SIL> violence and pornography and yknow <HES-things> <SIL> things that <SIL> we <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> when i was growing up <SIL> we just <SIL> there was no way i could <SIL> see any of that stuff i had good parents but i <SIL> i was in to <SIL> yknow <SIL> lassie and tom and jerry i mean yknow these but yknow they weren't violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but <HES-I> <SIL> i just think <SIL> i don't think it could <VOCNOISE> <SIL> turn back <VOCNOISE> right now <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
there's just too much diversity <IVER>
in the world <IVER>
and too much prejudice <SIL> there really is still and it's sad but <SIL> it there really is <IVER>
yep <SIL> i do <SIL> i really do <VOCNOISE> i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of thems from their parents but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it's amazing how many guns and they say that <VOCNOISE> the police are selling guns <SIL> to people and they don't realize <SIL> yknow their old guns that they confiscate and they don't realize where they're going i mean that amazes me <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> but there's always gonna be <SIL> the underworld and <VOCNOISE> different <SIL> ways that kids and people can get guns <SIL> and it's sad i don't know how we could ever <SIL> limit that but <SIL> there's so many millions of <SIL> guns in the world that <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> you're wondering where are they all coming from <SIL> um <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new <VOCNOISE> guns that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> not just a safety lock but <SIL> yknow you <VOCNOISE> it's like identification thing <SIL> yknow <IVER>
only the <ERROR-only-er=owner> can do it i mean <SIL> seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that <VOCNOISE> the people who have guns and <SIL> in their home and not have them <SIL> locked up or in a <VOCNOISE> yknow in a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> place that no child could find it <SIL> they're to blame <SIL> they are they're to blame <SIL> um <SIL> that whole thing with the um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> school out in colorado <SIL> um <SIL> i forget the name of it but <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents didn't <VOCNOISE> were clueless i just find that really hard to believe <SIL> if a child goes in to a garage every night and you hear clanging and <SIL> and they're buying gun metal and <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then they were totally <SIL> um <SIL> not in tune with what their kids were doing <SIL> it's one thing them having a site on the internet <IVER>
it's another thing that they're in their own <SIL> in the house where the parents are every night <VOCNOISE> and not going in to the garage and finding things <IVER>
i just can't believe and they said they didn't even know what was going on <IVER>
it is <IVER>
um <SIL> <IVER>
i do because they weren't <SIL> yknow they weren't <SIL> in their <SIL> children's lives enough <SIL> you know they weren't talking about things being open about things at dinner <SIL> yknow finding out about school <SIL> um <SIL> i <CUTOFF-k_ih=can't> you can't blame them for having a site on the internet not too many <VOCNOISE> <SIL> parents would know that that they their kids yknow <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but no i think i i i put the blame on the parents <IVER>
i do i think <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow if you're open with your kids nowadays you have to be with <SIL> everything that's in the world <SIL> mean my parents never talked to me about drugs or anything <IVER>
and it was just when <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the drug culture was just <SIL> yknow starting we learned about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me <SIL> or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but <SIL> today with teenagers and everything so out in the open <SIL> you have to talk to them about things and just say <VOCNOISE> you know <SIL> i want to help you and i <SIL> yknow be there for them a hundred percent obviously <SIL> those parents were to busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing <SIL> so i think they're the ones to be <SIL> to blame i do <IVER>
yeah <SIL> not that they could have stopped it but they <SIL> they should have known what was going on <SIL> uh i really think <SIL> if they were close with their children they would have known <SIL> something was wrong <SIL> especially with these kids <SIL> here are so removed and <SIL> don't talk to their parents and start dressing <SIL> certain ways <SIL> you know that they're <SIL> yknow going a <SIL> turning a different <LAUGH> <SIL> yknow <SIL> i just <SIL> i blame them though <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
but they lived in a beautiful home <SIL> i mean if you're to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> kids like that i could see <SIL> if they're <SIL> in a <SIL> poor in harlem or whatever <SIL> but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful home in colorado i mean yknow <SIL> i just think they were <SIL> removed from what their children <SIL> or their son was doing <IVER>
totally <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i don't think that though yknow women need to work <SIL> and <SIL> most families do need two incomes <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and <SIL> plus when kids go into high school <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know you have <NOISE> pardon me you have to worry about them but <SIL> yknow you <SIL> you have to let them experience some of life <SIL> on their own <IVER>
that's a big growing period yknow from junior high to high school is when you really <SIL> learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life <SIL> um <SIL> my mother was always home she was <SIL> um <SIL> which was good to come home to because i had friends <SIL> whose parent mothers weren't there and they had to clean and they had to start dinner and they hated it yknow i mean and they <SIL> feel that they kind of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> missed out on things <SIL> um <SIL> but <SIL> i think <SIL> yknow kids <SIL> lot of them who have <SIL> when they <VOCNOISE> parents have money <SIL> and um <SIL> both parents worked i'm not sure if the columbine <SIL> if both parents worked but <SIL> i don't think <SIL> just the mother being home there <SIL> would have totally helped <SIL> no <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well <SIL> i don't think they should be responsible i think <SIL> um <SIL> kids go to school <SIL> and they need role models good teachers <SIL> um <SIL> and i think schools have gotten a lot <VOCNOISE> better about that it seemed like in the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> late eighties early nineties yknow the schools <SIL> a lot of them were really bad <SIL> um <SIL> i think <SIL> finally <SIL> the education <SIL> department or whatever is <SIL> realizing that <SIL> parents need help with their kids they can't <NOISE> do everything and <SIL> yknow they just need really positive things when they do go to school <SIL> and <SIL> yknow i think teachers are a big part of it <VOCNOISE> i really do <SIL> yknow you remember when you have a good teacher and that you've learned a lot <SIL> um and i think <SIL> yknow through education <SIL> because it's hard all these schools in so many rural areas and everything <SIL> try to get good teachers and then <VOCNOISE> yknow it's always have to do with money and them not <VOCNOISE> making enough money which <SIL> the teachers don't make enough money <SIL> and they're overworked and all these big large classrooms <SIL> and it just seems to me <SIL> when kids start <SIL> dressing and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> getting in a clique together <SIL> yknow would be hard for them to <VOCNOISE> intervene and <HES-say> say oh what's going on in your life what's your <VOCNOISE> what's the problem you know that's <SIL> that's not really <SIL> should be their role <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> if they care enough they should call the parents and say <UNKNOWN> look we're worried about your son <SIL> he misses lot of school or he's starting to dress really <SIL> ynkow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> sometimes and it shouldn't be that dress <SIL> has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids <SIL> go a different way <SIL> it does involve dress <SIL> and <SIL> just <SIL> yknow <SIL> turning against the norm of the society <SIL> yknow <NOISE> <SIL> and if they don't want to be in sports that's fine there are so many different things they can do in <SIL> in school and learn about arts and music and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> unfortunately a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools <SIL> to more or less pick up the slack <SIL> of what <SIL> the parents can't do <SIL> but in some ways <SIL> it's always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home <SIL> yknow <SIL> i mean <IVER>
well <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
i think it would help <SIL> i do <SIL> i am against religion in school <SIL> i just don't think <SIL> they should push that on people <IVER>
um <SIL> yknow <SIL> i mean i don't think they should make people pray if they don't want to before class or anything yknow like that <SIL> but as far as morals and the right <SIL> thing to do in life and <SIL> what's out there and <SIL> yknow most kids know what the wrong thing is but <IVER>
um <SIL> i think <SIL> i think through education <SIL> that's <SIL> it's just gonna only help <SIL> kids because a lot times maybe they don't get that at home <SIL> so they're really looking <SIL> to choose the right thing to do 
help <IVER>
i do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i am against religion in school <SIL> i just don't think <SIL> they should push that on people <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> you know <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean i don't think they should make people pray if they don't want to before class or anything <SIL> yknow like that <VOCNOISE> but as far as morals and the right <SIL> thing to do in life and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what's out there and <SIL> yknow most kids know what the wrong thing is but <IVER>
um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> i think through education <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's <SIL> it's just gonna <SIL> only help <IVER>
kids because a lot times maybe they don't get that at home <VOCNOISE> so they're really looking <SIL> to choose the right thing to do <VOCNOISE> and through school and <CUTOFF-clipping=word> through education <VOCNOISE> that's their avenue to go there <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> so unfortunately <SIL> yknow and i guess i never thought of it <VOCNOISE> a lot more pressure is put on <VOCNOISE> schools and education now <SIL> <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and these schools that have a thousand people i just can't imagine <SIL> i mean yknow my my high school was like <SIL> four hundred people and we <SIL> thought that was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> big at the time <VOCNOISE> and just to have a thousand <CUTOFF-pee=people> <NOISE> excuse <SIL> me people and <SIL> just to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> try to monitor different things i mean it's gotta be so <SIL> hard <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know <SIL> in checking everything and <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
i just think it's sad even here in columbus yknow like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools <NOISE> and i thought <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just <SIL> yknow it just could because <SIL> of all the things you've seen in the world <SIL> in the last few year <VOCNOISE> that these kids want to do this just to see <SIL> what's gonna happen <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yknow it's it's just sad <SIL> in our society that that's what it's <SIL> turning to <IVER>
i went to brook haven <SIL> which is uh <SIL> up on karl road <VOCNOISE> <SIL> near northland mall <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yep <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yes <SIL> i do <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> honestly growing up <SIL> we didn't have we <SIL> it wasn't really called sex ed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> they talked about the female reproductive system <SIL> nothing about men which is kind of funny <SIL> yknow it was always the women <SIL> and that chart yknow <IVER>
and those <SIL> tubes and all that i mean i remember seeing that like in eighth grade and looking that thinking that's me yknow <IVER>
<SIL> um <IVER>
but with <SIL> kids and they're just so much <SIL> more <SIL> active at a early age <IVER>
<SIL> yknow and i hear about kids <SIL> twelve <CUTOFF-th=third> thirteen <LAUGH> <SIL> luckily i wasn't that early <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think <SIL> once they start <SIL> yknow like sixth grade they really <SIL> should relate to them <SIL> <IVER>
um <IVER>
<SIL> i <SIL> think that's too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow with aids and that as <SIL> rampant it is is now and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there are so many more women that have it <SIL> um started off it was mostly men <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> women have got to know <SIL> as <CUTOFF-ah=at> at an early age <SIL> yknow <SIL> about these different diseases and things <IVER>
and i think that <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> the morals being <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> especially <SIL> at a young age yknow abstinence is the best policy <VOCNOISE> so many people <SIL> i <SIL> i <SIL> think they are <VOCNOISE> turning to they're not gonna <NOISE> have any <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> thing <LAUGH> do anything before they're married um <VOCNOISE> but in today's life <NOISE> once you get in to college and stuff it's a little hard to <VOCNOISE> but i think a lot more kids are going <VOCNOISE> that route <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because my <SIL> parents never talked to me about sex <VOCNOISE> we all learned it from our friends <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> my mother was very open <NOISE> but i think in today's world <VOCNOISE> because really there wasn't <SIL> <NOISE> there wasn't that many <SIL> diseases <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow there was but <VOCNOISE> you just didn't hear about it <IVER>
and the pregnancies and all the unwanted children and everything like that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i just heard this week that in france they have <VOCNOISE> uh that morning after pill <IVER>
and you know i just really think they need to make that <VOCNOISE> and not <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> an option <SIL> for a young girl <VOCNOISE> i really do because there's just <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> there's just too many unwanted children <NOISE> there just is and that really bothers me <SIL> that we don't have another option <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like another <SIL> country <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> we're a lot more right wing here in america <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i just feel that's got to be an option <NOISE> yknow for these young girls <VOCNOISE> it just really does <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <SIL> <IVER>
right <IVER>
well <IVER>
but i <SIL> think it should be an option <VOCNOISE> you know i'm really <SIL> you know for women's right and everything because i was single for so long <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i just feel <SIL> if a man could have a child <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it would be different but since women are the only ones that can <VOCNOISE> then it's <SIL> ultimate <SIL> ultimately should be our choice <SIL> i really do <SIL> and i think <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know we should have every option available <VOCNOISE> <SIL> especially when you're young <SIL> no girl should have to go through <SIL> you know <SIL> pregnancy and everything even if it's a mistake or whatever i just <SIL> you know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it ruins their lives <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when they don't have the option <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
well <SIL> i think at that age the <SIL> parents should be involved <SIL> and hopefully they'll be open minded enough to know that this is going to be something she's going to have the rest of her life <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'll tell you what with today's <SIL> world <SIL> and some of these fourteen year olds <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that look like they're twenty <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> you know <SIL> they <SIL> they know what they're doing <SIL> and no they shouldn't keep <SIL> repeating that <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> i just think <SIL> the most important thing is is for them to be able to have the option <SIL> i really do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but yes the parents should be involved i'd say to the age <SIL> seventeen maybe <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know i <SIL> think they should have a <SIL> parent's consent and hopefully <VOCNOISE> the parents will love their daughter enough to realize <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> what a <SIL> mistake it's going to be if <SIL> she's gonna be young mother and then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> eventually maybe not even want to be a mother <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just <SIL> they kill them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow and there's so much that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> for a while there that was going on and it's like you <SIL> i can't believe these women are doing this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they just snap <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'll be honest <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i have a lot of homosexual friends <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> being in the restaurant business and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> growing up in the restaurant business and that's how i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> really kind of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> met them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i was going to school i didn't know any <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i went to o u and honestly down there i didn't know <SIL> i didn't know anybody was gay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i feel <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <SIL> a lot of people were i'll say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> most of them <SIL> or all of them <SIL> are born that way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> some of them do make a choice <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i <SIL> feel that <VOCNOISE> it should be <VOCNOISE> <SIL> talked about in school <VOCNOISE> um for so long <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was in the closet <LAUGH> <SIL> yknow they didn't talk about it and these kids yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> had to hide it and i just think in today's world and there's so many people that are openly gay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it should be talked about more in school <SIL> i do <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> especially <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just think some <VOCNOISE> and women <SIL> there's <SIL> women that <SIL> you know i had <SIL> my gym teacher brook haven now that i look at it <VOCNOISE> i didn't know then <VOCNOISE> but she was gay <VOCNOISE> i mean we didn't <SIL> i didn't think that then i don't know why but she was very manly but she was very <VOCNOISE> she was very good but she was <VOCNOISE> you know just <SIL> not <SIL> feminine at all <IVER>
and not that that changed my opinion of her <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> back then and nobody would talk about it <SIL> and <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just think <SIL> in today's world <SIL> we need to bring <VOCNOISE> <SIL> subjects like that out <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no one <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because there's so many people who are ashamed about <SIL> things <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they shouldn't be ashamed because it's a lifestyle anymore <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i just <SIL> it needs to be brought up more <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well but see i think if you <SIL> really try to tell <SIL> kids and especially women <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> yknow you shouldn't <SIL> sex is something that <SIL> should be between two people that love each other <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and unless you really <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> feel love and really <SIL> think <SIL> it is love then <SIL> yknow <SIL> you shouldn't do it <IVER>
um i know that's a lot easier said than done <VOCNOISE> because <SIL> you fall in love every other week sometimes when you're young <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i don't think it encourages it <NOISE> i just think in <SIL> you know they show so much on t v it's all yknow people are <SIL> nude on at ten o clock at night on these shows <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and these girls are watching it <VOCNOISE> i mean granted most of them are adults <SIL> but on the soap operas and stuff it's a different story <VOCNOISE> so they're seeing it anyways <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> you just i think if you're open enough with your children these parents <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and say you know we <CUTOFF-w=want> <SIL> we want to give you this option we really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> prefer you don't do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected <IVER>
i mean i think that's the best way to <NOISE> address it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who <SIL> say well maybe i'm gay i don't know if i'm gay or what <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> hopefully <SIL> they'll know <SIL> their true identity <SIL> eventually <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i mean yes some people <SIL> 
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> you just i think if you're open enough with your children these parents <VOCNOISE> and say you know we <CUTOFF-w-want> <SIL> we want to give you this option we really prefer you don't do this <VOCNOISE> but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected <IVER>
i mean i think that's the best way to <NOISE> address it <VOCNOISE> and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who <SIL> say well maybe i'm gay i don't know if i'm gay or what <SIL> well <SIL> hopefully <SIL> they'll know <SIL> their true identity <VOCNOISE> eventually <SIL> i mean yes some people <VOCNOISE> i mean i know men <VOCNOISE> several men who got married had children and then they <NOISE> decided they were gay <VOCNOISE> okay were they gay before but they did like women <IVER>
yknow and they did want the children <IVER>
and now <SIL> they live <VOCNOISE> in gay relationships <IVER>
but they said all along <SIL> they were gay <SIL> they just fought it <SIL> and they they didn't want the pressure from their families <IVER>
so <SIL> ah <SIL> you <NOISE> know <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i just think the more you're open about things <VOCNOISE> i just think that's the best why it <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> when you put things and don't talk about it that's when the problems start <IVER>
but i think kids in high school and stuff <SIL> some of them <NOISE> like <SIL> my brother in law is gay <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> when i met him i knew he was i <SIL> yknow <SIL> he was the type <SIL> some of them you can't tell well it doesn't matter what they look like <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but my husband said all through growing up <SIL> he liked men <SIL> he didn't like girls <VOCNOISE> he looked at <LAUGH-magazines you know all this stuff <VOCNOISE> and i thought that's so funny because growing up i just didn't know <SIL> know anybody that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um but <SIL> you know he was openly gay to his mother right from the beginning <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> she was from germany which made it a little tough because <SIL> yknow they didn't talk about <SIL> <UNKNOWN> those things <SIL> over there at all <NOISE> for a long time <SIL> but um <SIL> then she became very open with him and every but everybody knew <NOISE> <SIL> and that was in the eighties <NOISE> and <SIL> yknow <SIL> if some kids know it when they're young and growing up <SIL> yknow i don't know if it's best to not say it or to <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> be open but if they're open to their parents about it <VOCNOISE> then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better then <SIL> than if they wait <SIL> later on in their life <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> but some of sometimes i guess they change <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> most the men i knew <SIL> right off the bat <SIL> know i mean i mean it was it <VOCNOISE> and it was all through their life it wasn't as though they just said oh <SIL> i'm <CUTOFF-go-going> <SIL> i'm going be gay <IVER>
so <SIL> i just <SIL> with that terrible thing that happened <EXT-in> <SIL> montana <IVER>
with that boy <IVER>
and just just shows the ignorance in so many people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's at that really still bothers me that <SIL> there's there is <UNKNOWN> still so much of that going on <SIL> you know <IVER>
it was <IVER>
it is <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> it does <IVER>
yeah they have the gay pride parade and everything which is good they should be able to <IVER>
yes <IVER>
well <IVER>
yes <SIL> but you know what his parents are gonna <SIL> yknow really going to let people know that <IVER>
this just can't go on not that they're going to stop it totally <IVER>
but it made <SIL> a lot of people more aware <IVER>
that it's still really going on <SIL> yknow and his parents accepted him <IVER>
which <SIL> they have to <IVER>
you can't <SIL> you can't be <SIL> mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle <SIL> you just can't life's too short <SIL> you know <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> you can love them either way it doesn't make any difference <IVER>
<NOISE> they did <IVER>
i think so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
that is <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
no i don't either because i believe in the death penalty and i feel <SIL> taking a life like that leaving someone there just to die <IVER>
tied up to a fence <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know <SIL> i think they deserve to die <SIL> because <SIL> with the <SIL> prisons and the overcrowding that's a whole another subject <VOCNOISE> you know that <SIL> it's just amazing to me so many people are in there that <SIL> should be dead <SIL> i feel <SIL> because <SIL> we're just paying for them to <VOCNOISE> live in there <IVER>
but um <IVER>
yeah 
<NOISE> <SIL> you want my name now <IVER>
okay <EXCLUDE-name> <IVER>
uh hum <IVER>
and you're not being recorded now <IVER>
oh you are <VOCNOISE> i don't see a microphone in front of you that's what i was wondering <IVER>
okay <SIL> okay <IVER>
all right <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
alright <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> very good <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we're up here in the attic and <VOCNOISE> the ink's freezing up on us <IVER>
who is gonna witness this now there's no one here <IVER>
oh <VOCNOISE> hum <IVER>
whereabouts upstate <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
watertown waterbury <IVER>
watertown <IVER>
well after graduating from the state <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i've been here <SIL> thirty some years <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and employed now with the <VOCNOISE> transportation department <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i started out in the finance area <VOCNOISE> with the <VOCNOISE> as an <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> and then when divesture of the bell system occurred in the country <VOCNOISE> uh i was drafted to <VOCNOISE> head up and develop a uh telecommunications section within o dot <VOCNOISE> and so currently uh <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i'm <VOCNOISE> i used to be the manager of telecommunications of o dot but now i'm a <LAUGH> the special project coordinator <SIL> for telecommunications at o dot <SIL> and in addition i'm a <VOCNOISE> a cruise agent <SIL> in preparation for retirement <SIL> so i've been working on that <NOISE> and i got my <CUTOFF-asso=associates> um <SIL> accredited affiliation with the noise cruise line international here this last year <VOCNOISE> and so i'm ready to go cruising <IVER>
okay <SIL> i have two <CUTOFF-k=kids> <VOCNOISE> two um students <SIL> my one she's twenty six two <SIL> two <VOCNOISE> <SIL> children <VOCNOISE> one's a student here currently <IVER>
and uh the other one is um <VOCNOISE> a uh working cuff at the <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=Steubenville> steubenville ohio <VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> cuff is uh <VOCNOISE> catholics united for the faith <VOCNOISE> it's um <SIL> she had to go up and graduate from miami university of ohio and got affiliated with uh <SIL> campus crusade for christ and so forth and went out to dekalb in <SIL> working for northern illinois <VOCNOISE> then went back working for the inner city area of chicago <VOCNOISE> and found herself <VOCNOISE> that she liked steubenville better <VOCNOISE> and when i relocated her <SIL> people would say you're crazy young lady you're twenty five and you're moving to steubenville <VOCNOISE> they're migrating out of here <IVER>
but uh <VOCNOISE> she likes the spirituality of the community over there <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
i think this past year they had two <VOCNOISE> murders over there <SIL> and it was publicized in the columbus area but uh <SIL> it should <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
this <IVER>
yes <IVER>
and they had the strong uh public uh support over there it's a really is <SIL> tight knit community it's uh quite different <VOCNOISE> columbus needs to learn a lot from that area <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> it's a matter of just uh putting in i guess your hands in the <SIL> your <CUTOFF-f=faith> <SIL> practicing your faith <SIL> which we <IVER>
well i <CUTOFF-th-ih=think> i <VOCNOISE> i think we <CUTOFF-tru=truly> we <SIL> oh yeah we're we're church goers but just be going church goers isn't uh isn't being faithful <SIL> i think it's just a <VOCNOISE> sharing yourself uh <SIL> with one another in daily lives <SIL> uh listening to someone outreaching to someone <SIL> whatever it might be <SIL> that's the the ministry that uh i think our our our lord has given us <IVER>
the opportunity to serve one another <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> that's the downfall of our society because we're thinking more of ourself <VOCNOISE> others <SIL> and i think as <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> as we become <VOCNOISE> older <SIL> you start thinking about <SIL> how <SIL> um much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith <SIL> it's not the materialistic things that the university here <CUTOFF-progr=progresses> <SIL> uh <SIL> professes to be the thing <IVER>
cuff <IVER>
yes <IVER>
i am and <VOCNOISE> they are the <SIL> my wife wasn't <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
he's in his sophomore year <IVER>
i have no idea <VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
no it it's in uh it's in the ag <VOCNOISE> college but uh <SIL> why it's there i don't know <SIL> it's a matter <SIL> of how <SIL> they fit it in there but <SIL> it's dealing with construction management <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
north <IVER>
oh projects were <VOCNOISE> <SIL> right from infancy were <VOCNOISE> i was designing <VOCNOISE> the project <VOCNOISE> first of all we had to find out what we had <VOCNOISE> with the vesture and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh as everyone should know even as a residential user you have to know what you have in your house <SIL> the telephone company doesn't <SIL> provide the service to you anymore <SIL> well we had to know what we had through out the state of ohio <SIL> and some <SIL> eighty eight counties and uh wherever else number of facilities we had <SIL> and so we went on a scavenger hunt <IVER>
basically <SIL> because the plans which the utilities had <SIL> for our locations they could not provide to us because of the uh <SIL> the vesture ruling <SIL> so we had to go out and um <VOCNOISE> do our own surveys <SIL> become self educated through uh courses uh through a t t and through purdue university it was i think o u had some courses <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> the projects basically we were going from a um <VOCNOISE> putting together a network itself <SIL> and uh we had a <SIL> you think of a party line system what they used call daisy chain <SIL> in the industry <SIL> uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get on to <SIL> a data network <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> we got down to point where <SIL> we went to a <VOCNOISE> spoke network where everyone had dedicated pipe <IVER>
to the hub <VOCNOISE> um which course eliminated down time <SIL> but with um <VOCNOISE> that we were <SIL> not in a position to monitor traffic <IVER>
and telecommunications is very much like a highway <SIL> you need to know what your load's going to be before you construct it or vice yknow <VOCNOISE> otherwise your planning's way off <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> nowadays we're in a position where we're doing <VOCNOISE> more advancement than anything our agency is the only one in the state of ohio <SIL> and the private network <VOCNOISE> uh as a private sector is still looking as <CUTOFF-lo=looking> looking at us <VOCNOISE> as a showcase <SIL> we're doing voice <SIL> over i p internet <VOCNOISE> internet protocol <SIL> which means we're doing voice and data over the same pipe <SIL> and the long line carriers <SIL> they don't even know how to bill us <IVER>
and i think there's an article this last wednesday in the dispatch in business section as to <SIL> how <SIL> the p u c o can't regulate it and because of it they want to deregulate telecommunications <SIL> uh and so for the past <SIL> months we haven't been getting telephone bills <SIL> for usage <SIL> we have the backbone we're paying for <SIL> and what's going to happen out of this whole thing is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it offers us a a <VOCNOISE> a a lot of latitude where <VOCNOISE> with uh <SIL> we can <CUTOFF-n-ah=now> now <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if we have a contractor lets say over in dayton <VOCNOISE> and we're calling from zanesville <SIL> office <VOCNOISE> i'd rather make them long distance we can go on our pipe <VOCNOISE> and if we have a line going over dayton <VOCNOISE> we can make that call as if it's a local call <SIL> avoiding all long distance <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> so our backbone still there but <VOCNOISE> ultimately <VOCNOISE> as we get traffic uh measurements <VOCNOISE> we will be able to downsize the number of pipes we have <SIL> so streamlining our network <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> i said our our engineers they're not engineers <SIL> per se <VOCNOISE> but they are techies that are really in to this they they enjoy their work and <VOCNOISE> it's for <SIL> it's in the forefront <SIL> of ohio government <VOCNOISE> along with the technology <VOCNOISE> there has to also be the paperwork <VOCNOISE> now i know realize we have <VOCNOISE> a paperless environment <VOCNOISE> quote unquote <IVER>
but we still need to have property manager records that's very essential and a lot times when you're talking to engineers they don't <VOCNOISE> realize that part of it <VOCNOISE> um they don't like the detail <SIL> at least <SIL> that aspect of it <VOCNOISE> uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need know how <VOCNOISE> uh your uh <VOCNOISE> facilities are structured <VOCNOISE> uh the time history <VOCNOISE> any type of uh <VOCNOISE> activity on that whether it's been uh installed <VOCNOISE> removed <VOCNOISE> relocated <VOCNOISE> whatever might be <SIL> but we need know that how it had an impact upon the design of a the particular <VOCNOISE> uh facility voice and data 
<VOCNOISE> so that's basically what <VOCNOISE> we've been doing we've been progressing for fifteen years <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> i'm proud to say that our state agency is probably the only agency other than maybe this <VOCNOISE> highway patrol <SIL> we work a lot with them <VOCNOISE> but i think our we're the only ones that have their own wiring cable people <IVER>
and <SIL> the administrators for telecommunications for the state of ohio <VOCNOISE> are <SIL> working with us as observers because they don't have a staff <IVER>
and um <VOCNOISE> it it's great <SIL> we've been reengineered last eight years o dot downsizing <VOCNOISE> and trying to fit the uh <VOCNOISE> uh fit the i guess the attributes the person brings to work <SIL> as opposed to <VOCNOISE> not <VOCNOISE> one of the problems i <CUTOFF-f=feel> i see as an <VOCNOISE> as an employer or <CUTOFF-l=?> as a supervisor <VOCNOISE> manager <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a lot of times we have to promote because <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> the bureaucracy says you have to <SIL> do this in order to get up there <VOCNOISE> they don't take in consideration the attributes the person <EXT-has> and so now we're saying okay if you bring this attribute to the table <VOCNOISE> and you can help the team <EXT-out> <VOCNOISE> then why not reward <EXT-you> <SIL> instead of putting you over here in let's say a <EXT-managerial> position <VOCNOISE> which you really don't have any <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-call> for but you're there because the money only <VOCNOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> so we're trying to fit the attribute to the person compensate them accordingly <VOCNOISE> which <VOCNOISE> <SIL> hey if <VOCNOISE> i think we did that we'd probably have more teachers <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> but the <ERROR-thr=trouble> trouble is we don't fit the <VOCNOISE> horse with the proper carriage load <VOCNOISE> and we need to do that in our society we need to work as a <EXT-team> <VOCNOISE> there's no sense in having <CUTOFF-thr=three> <VOCNOISE> having five guards on a basketball team <VOCNOISE> if you don't have a center that can tip it off and rebound <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> we go out and look uh we look do it differently in sports but we do this differently in the <UNKNOWN> the uh secular world <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
we should look at it as <VOCNOISE> as a sport <IVER>
oh and that that's a problem in our society and if <CUTOFF-s=something> if something can come out <SIL> of the university here <VOCNOISE> to <EXT-promote> <SIL> the reverse of that <VOCNOISE> i think you have <SIL> a lot less psychological <SIL> problems with people <VOCNOISE> and domestic problems <SIL> work problems <SIL> everything <VOCNOISE> because the <SIL> problem comes down to the fact <VOCNOISE> well gee it's not <SIL> it's not recognized yknow were <VOCNOISE> <EXT-whatever> <EXT-these> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> trends in our society that say well you gotta be a <VOCNOISE> you gotta be a <VOCNOISE> computer guru <VOCNOISE> you gotta be <CUTOFF-thi=this> <VOCNOISE> well before <SIL> before <VOCNOISE> gates was recognized <VOCNOISE> he was nothing <IVER>
to our society <VOCNOISE> now we he we bow to him <IVER>
but what tell what does it tell us about our people <SIL> we're so <EXT-naive> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we've got to look inside ourselves and say what can we bring to society that that that can be more beneficial <VOCNOISE> and most the time <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> listening <IVER>
not for long <IVER>
you consider the housing trends <VOCNOISE> and there <VOCNOISE> there again that goes back to the stupid consumer <VOCNOISE> i say stupid consumer because <VOCNOISE> when i was in college i always said well <CUTOFF-f=fourth?> consumer had a fourth grade education level <IVER>
and how <VOCNOISE> how many dollars does a consumer put in to research as opposed to the business <VOCNOISE> that's the inequity in our life <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> you're you're basically putting the shaft to the consumer <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> until that consumer becomes on equal knowledge level as the <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-mark=market> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> it's always gonna be inequitable and you're gonna have a <VOCNOISE> problem <VOCNOISE> in our society because <VOCNOISE> we don't need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age <VOCNOISE> it becomes a liability <VOCNOISE> but then the developers are thinking well let's see well we can make <VOCNOISE-condos> downsize a little bit but still we want make this <SIL> we want make this margin of <EXT-profit> <VOCNOISE> yeah we do but what about for society's <SIL> best interests <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well you used a word <VOCNOISE> earlier in your statement <VOCNOISE> what we <EXT-should> <SIL> <EXT-buy> <IVER>
<HES-what> we should buy <VOCNOISE> yeah the retailer <VOCNOISE> what we should buy <VOCNOISE> and that's the <VOCNOISE> <EXT-problem> <VOCNOISE> we listen to <VOCNOISE> business <SIL> too <EXT-much> <VOCNOISE> if business <VOCNOISE> reemphasized <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> their goals to help society out and not themselves <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but you can <EXT-also> <SIL> you also grow with <EXT-respect> <VOCNOISE> you can work with the community and still gain the respect from community and you'll have allegiance but yknow nowadays we don't have any <CUTOFF-l=loyalty> <CUTOFF-loy=loyalty> loyalty at all it's out the window <VOCNOISE> uh and that's what i fear <VOCNOISE> the most <VOCNOISE> you're saying the internet <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> big deal you're going after <UNKNOWN> what you want well maybe some people want low cost <VOCNOISE> they don't want service okay <VOCNOISE> boom <VOCNOISE> disposable <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-that's> the problem we have in our society today because of one thing <VOCNOISE> we're trying <CUTOFF-communi=communicate> <VOCNOISE> communicate as you say through the internet and through businesses <VOCNOISE> but we don't have <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-compassion> <SIL> and we don't have commitment <VOCNOISE> without those <EXT-three> <SIL> you'll never have success <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i think it starts <VOCNOISE> with the family <VOCNOISE> but the problem is in the last thirty years we've emphasized <VOCNOISE> uh not i shouldn't say thirty years <SIL> post <SIL> world war two <VOCNOISE> post world war two is where we broke the family up <VOCNOISE> and let me tell you how i <VOCNOISE> i analyze this <VOCNOISE> during world war two we took the little lady out of the house and said hey <VOCNOISE> we need you on the production lines <VOCNOISE> making war machineries <IVER>
so be it <VOCNOISE> yknow we had the <UNKNOWN> out there helping out the the g i's fine <VOCNOISE> team effort wasn't it <VOCNOISE> but then <VOCNOISE> after g i's came home <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> the little lady went back in to the house <VOCNOISE> and business all these <VOCNOISE> idle lines say hey <VOCNOISE> we can do something here <VOCNOISE> because in those days the little lady said well i'll go out and get a little odd job uh we want a little <VOCNOISE> thing <VOCNOISE> mom would do <VOCNOISE> pick up a little extra things here <VOCNOISE> and so forth <VOCNOISE> dad was a <CUTOFF-pr=primary> <VOCNOISE> primary breadwinner <VOCNOISE> but she'd go out and do some odd jobs just to compliment <VOCNOISE> their needs for that budget <VOCNOISE> they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it <VOCNOISE> they did not <VOCNOISE> go out and spend on credit <VOCNOISE> and now i mean i'm jumping ahead of myself here but <VOCNOISE> business said hey let's produce these lines <VOCNOISE> little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it <IVER>
<EXT-ah> <EXT-yeah> <EXT-fine> <VOCNOISE> now it comes back to your statement <VOCNOISE> what do they <VOCNOISE-tell> us we need <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well now well gee <CUTOFF-uw=?> you need a refrigerator you need frost free <VOCNOISE> you need all these things <VOCNOISE> and you know <EXT-what> <VOCNOISE> you go down the street and see how many garage sales you have <SIL> and then you ask people <SIL> why'd you buy them <SIL> <EXT-oh> we thought we needed them <IVER>
see it <VOCNOISE-there> again <VOCNOISE> the business out foxed the consumer <VOCNOISE> basically <VOCNOISE> you need to do <VOCNOISE> less consumption and buying material goods <VOCNOISE> and sharing your time with one another trying to understand your neighbor <EXT-more> <VOCNOISE> and spending time giving quality time for understanding the intangibles <SIL> of life <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-the> tangibles depreciate <VOCNOISE> and they will depreciate and will be nothing <VOCNOISE> and your investments <VOCNOISE> gone <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but you <VOCNOISE-had> to you <VOCNOISE> you had to work <SIL> you had to <VOCNOISE> you had to migrate <VOCNOISE> they they started separating the family up <SIL> by saying <VOCNOISE> sir if you want a job we're expanding to los angeles we're <CUTOFF-sah=?> <VOCNOISE> so they split the family up <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> okay fine <VOCNOISE> and the family <SIL> probably said okay we're we want you to get <SIL> advancement we want <VOCNOISE> your good will <VOCNOISE> the problem is <VOCNOISE> you ran up a culture differences <VOCNOISE> culture differences over here and so forth <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> and then we became a little more <VOCNOISE> uh promiscuous <VOCNOISE> and i said well gee yknow <VOCNOISE> mom dad and so forth they don't know what's going on out here on the west coast with us yknow and so forth <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-and> they think everything is going okay because we didn't have communication as <EXT-frequent> <VOCNOISE> and then all of a sudden you find out <VOCNOISE> and usually mom found out she is something doesn't sound right through the airways or to the writing something's mysterious going on here <VOCNOISE> and you find out they were <CUTOFF-doin=doing> having difficulties <VOCNOISE> well divorce became acceptable <SIL> before it was a no <EXT-no> <SIL> now it's acceptable <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> you had <VOCNOISE> uh the celebrities becoming more notable <EXT-ah> <EXT-hey> we don't we don't <CUTOFF-g-ih=get> we don't get married anymore no okay <VOCNOISE> then we had the idea <VOCNOISE> of doing away with <EXT-cash> <SIL> gold metallic the metallic backing i think it was <VOCNOISE-Kennedy> was the one that did that <VOCNOISE> and said we'll just uh <VOCNOISE> print promissory notes <VOCNOISE> and so <CUTOFF-n=now> <SIL> now we keep <EXT-credit> <SIL> we <VOCNOISE> we buy ourselves out every dilemma in the <EXT-world> <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> saying well hey we'll just pay you <EXT-more> <SIL> we pay you more country then fine <SIL> but every time they <SIL> print more <SIL> it makes the money in your <CUTOFF-pur=purse> investment <EXT-less> <SIL> but hey who cares huh that's what they <VOCNOISE> kept promoting <SIL> and then all of a sudden about nineties they came around say hey you know what <VOCNOISE> our <CUTOFF-cre=credit> our deficit is going the other way <VOCNOISE> we're <VOCNOISE> we're going way out of whack on this thing <VOCNOISE> that's because you've been spending more <VOCNOISE> consumers are doing the same thing <VOCNOISE> they haven't learned that mom and dad remember <VOCNOISE> mom went out and got a little piece as a time that they needed things <VOCNOISE> no i want the whole house completely furnished i want the cars <VOCNOISE> we don't talk about buying cars nowadays we talk about leasing cars <VOCNOISE> and pretty soon we're not going be buying houses we'll be leasing houses from the finance companies <VOCNOISE> we won't be owning a land the finance company own <UNKNOWN-the> 
kept promoting <VOCNOISE> and then all of sudden about nineties they came around and said <VOCNOISE-hey> yknow what <VOCNOISE> our <CUTOFF-kr=?> our deficit is going the other <EXT-way> <SIL> we're <VOCNOISE> we're going way out of whack on this thing <VOCNOISE> that's because we've been spending more <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-consumers> are doing the same thing <VOCNOISE> they haven't <EXT-learned> that mom and dad remember <VOCNOISE> mom when out and got a little piece as the time as they needed things <VOCNOISE> no i want the whole house completely furnished i want the cars <VOCNOISE> we don't talk about buying <VOCNOISE-cars> nowadays we talk about leasing cars <VOCNOISE> and pretty soon we're not gonna be buying houses we'll be leasing houses from the finance companies <VOCNOISE> we won't be owning the land the finance company own the <VOCNOISE> you don't own it <SIL> you're leasing it <VOCNOISE> and that's our quality of <EXT-life> <VOCNOISE> and when we go to third world countries we say <VOCNOISE> i don't know how they can stand living here <VOCNOISE> and <EXT-yet> <VOCNOISE> yknow what <VOCNOISE> they probably have better quality of understanding one another <VOCNOISE> then we do <VOCNOISE> because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further you become apart <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you said were their governments <CUTOFF-respons=responsible> <VOCNOISE> government stays out of <EXT-things> <SIL> that's our problem <VOCNOISE> government's <VOCNOISE> into too many things <VOCNOISE> they need to be <VOCNOISE> out of your nose <SIL> <CUTOFF-wi=with> <VOCNOISE> that's your personal business they need to be out of your business <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=and> <IVER>
the personal thing is you need to have <VOCNOISE> ethics <IVER>
in the business world <VOCNOISE> in other words <VOCNOISE> i used to work <VOCNOISE> uh during <HES-uh> highschool days <VOCNOISE> for a furniture company <HES-and> back in those days it was nine days <SIL> <VOCNOISE-cash> <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> we'd sell it to people and the <VOCNOISE> and i said well gee <VOCNOISE> we just <VOCNOISE> and we talked to the manager <VOCNOISE> oh they they don't have the <CUTOFF-mon=money> they don't have the money that's financed the <EXT-bank> <VOCNOISE> well why are we selling it to them then <VOCNOISE> well we'll get our money back and the bank bank get the money and we'll get a <CUTOFF-f=?> we'll repossess it <VOCNOISE> and we sold the same darn thing over three or four <EXT-times> <SIL> this poor sucker is out there get stuck with credit ratings <VOCNOISE> the bank's making money <VOCNOISE> we're making money <VOCNOISE> they're losing <VOCNOISE> now is that business ethics <VOCNOISE> i ask you <VOCNOISE> is it no <UNKNOWN> is it proper business <CUTOFF-eth=ethics> ethics <IVER>
that's where we need to correct <IVER>
that's where you need to correct <VOCNOISE> you can't just say <VOCNOISE> hey we got a schnook out here we can screw him <VOCNOISE> that's a <VOCNOISE> problem <VOCNOISE> and you're saying does it <CUTOFF-t_ih=??> does it does it take home does it take church <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> takes morals <VOCNOISE> and that's why i was telling before we got away from morals in our society <VOCNOISE> we could care less about you <VOCNOISE> i always say a <CUTOFF-s=salesman> a uh good successful salesman will be able to sell his own mother <VOCNOISE> i mean sell his own mother <VOCNOISE> on a <CUTOFF-n=on> on the market <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you're not gonna make as much <VOCNOISE-money> the people are gonna say gee i'm not going to them <UNKNOWN> i'm <UNKNOWN> place else <VOCNOISE> again it gets back to weaknesses in our standards in society <VOCNOISE> we we could care less about anybody else <VOCNOISE> we don't <VOCNOISE> hey if i have problems <VOCNOISE> the government is gonna help me out <VOCNOISE> that's a mindset that's been entrenched for forty some <EXT-years> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-it's> a mindset <VOCNOISE> that if you talk to the older generations are dying off now <VOCNOISE> that said we would never had in our lifetime <VOCNOISE> it's a ruination of our <VOCNOISE> country <VOCNOISE> and if you are old enough to remember kruschev <VOCNOISE> i believe krushchev is right we will bury you <VOCNOISE> we'll bury you internally in other words we will break you up you will separate internally you have dysfunctional people we are <VOCNOISE> we're dysfunctional families <VOCNOISE> if you ever work on pastoral care activity you'll find out that people <VOCNOISE> are so concerned about their families <VOCNOISE> that they <CUTOFF-f=fail> <VOCNOISE> they fail <VOCNOISE> they think because their family is broken up they've got <VOCNOISE> single parents here they've got <VOCNOISE> divorced here <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> they don't know what's going on they're doing drugs <VOCNOISE> well the <VOCNOISE> problem is we never got involved <VOCNOISE> as you said busy <VOCNOISE> we make more time yknow there's more time <VOCNOISE> spent for soccer on sunday <VOCNOISE> then going to church <VOCNOISE> you talk about <VOCNOISE> uh they said was it meet the press <CUTOFF-quo=quote> as i think slogan is <VOCNOISE> a <VOCNOISE-day> without meet <VOCNOISE> a sunday without meet the press <VOCNOISE> yknow day <UNKNOWN> was it <VOCNOISE> something like <HES-uh> sunday's not a sunday without meet the <EXT-Press> <SIL> well hey <VOCNOISE> that just tells you right there <VOCNOISE> where our thoughts <EXT-are> <SIL> we're <EXT-only> <VOCNOISE-thinking> of ourselves <VOCNOISE> i guarantee it as you get older <VOCNOISE> you start thinking a little differently <VOCNOISE> and i think as you talk you should be talking to some older people <VOCNOISE> i'm saying people um in the in their eighties <VOCNOISE> to find out how the progression of life is <VOCNOISE> and how you think <VOCNOISE> because when you go to estate sales <VOCNOISE> all you're talking about this profit motive <VOCNOISE> you're sitting on a lawns <VOCNOISE> the quality of life <VOCNOISE> is in the mind the person you're <VOCNOISE> you you avoided all the time <IVER>
and that's what we're concerned with <VOCNOISE> you need to interact more with people we need to interact more people <SIL> every day of our life that's what we <VOCNOISE> learn <VOCNOISE> from <VOCNOISE> we don't learn by giving <VOCNOISE> things to people <VOCNOISE> just like if you were um <SIL> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> a parent giving a giving allowance you don't give them to <VOCNOISE> your kids uh money to do chores and that you don't expect them to do <VOCNOISE> but you give them something in addition <VOCNOISE> to develop more responsibility <VOCNOISE> but we don't talk about responsibility in our society today <VOCNOISE> i i <VOCNOISE> i dare you to say we're in a <CUTOFF-h_eh_k=?> <VOCNOISE> they say publicly <VOCNOISE> this is <VOCNOISE> our bill of responsibility <VOCNOISE> do you know where there is <SIL> <NOISE> do we talk about responsibilities now <IVER>
if you if <VOCNOISE> if if you say buy <VOCNOISE> buy from those <VOCNOISE> unscrupulous business people and say <VOCNOISE> ah gee these guys got it on credit <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> what happens to that person <VOCNOISE> that files bankruptcy <VOCNOISE> ah <VOCNOISE> file bankruptcy it's okay <VOCNOISE> i'll do something else <VOCNOISE> next time <IVER>
we start them over again <VOCNOISE> they have never learned <VOCNOISE> and reason why <VOCNOISE> you're throwing out <VOCNOISE-carrying> out too <VOCNOISE> much in front of them without saying hey <VOCNOISE> you gotta do this to prove this to me <VOCNOISE> <EXT-no> we we we <VOCNOISE> lack <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> one heck a lot of <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-ethical> moral standards in this country we're losing it every day <VOCNOISE> and until we start looking at ourselves in in the mirror at night and say <VOCNOISE> i'm proud of myself i'm proud of what i did <VOCNOISE> i may not have made a dollar <EXT-today> <VOCNOISE> but i understood somebody <EXT-today> <IVER>
no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <HES-I> <IVER>
<EXT-I> i <VOCNOISE> i don't think it's necessarily that i think it's comes back to the lack of self discipline <IVER>
no i <VOCNOISE> you had women that working before <VOCNOISE> you had <VOCNOISE> women working before <VOCNOISE> but self discipline is <UNKNOWN> family <VOCNOISE> it's part of it <SIL> self discipline <VOCNOISE> making things too easy for us oh we <VOCNOISE-can't> do without it <VOCNOISE> you ever <VOCNOISE> you ever try to work for something i mean you really struggle to to achieve something <SIL> did it mean more to you than something that was given to you <VOCNOISE> tell me <IVER>
but but was if that if that but if that p h d was given to you <VOCNOISE> if they lowered the standards <VOCNOISE> if they lowered the standards <VOCNOISE> for you to get into <VOCNOISE> graduate <EXT-school> <VOCNOISE> it wouldn't that be challenging for you hey great they lowered it for me <VOCNOISE> my sister didn't have oh she had a rough time getting in but now i can get in anywhere i got a lower <CUTOFF-sta=standard> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-doe=doesn't> that <IVER>
doesn't that mean make <IVER>
so when you compare <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> and that's it they hadn't had a challenge you need to have challenges put <SIL> to you everyday <VOCNOISE> everyday <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> you have more meaningfulness in life <VOCNOISE> so that when you <VOCNOISE> put your head down at night you're saying oh i'm thankful for what i did <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> gosh darn it i'm still coming to you <VOCNOISE> i <HES-need> more help tomorrow because <LAUGH> without <VOCNOISE> something <VOCNOISE-intangible> <VOCNOISE> there's gonna be a motivation factor <VOCNOISE> someone's gotta give you a drill and to get up tomorrow morning and say hey i'm gonna do a better job today <VOCNOISE> than i did yesterday <VOCNOISE> but when we <VOCNOISE> as a society <VOCNOISE> say oh <VOCNOISE> gee <VOCNOISE> he's struggled yesterday well <VOCNOISE> let's lower this thing bar let's <VOCNOISE> lower the bar a little more <VOCNOISE> let's lower <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> gosh darn it <VOCNOISE> hey <VOCNOISE> scooney you didn't make that last shot last night <VOCNOISE> hey <VOCNOISE> hey time out <VOCNOISE> let's give scooney two more minutes to make <VOCNOISE> let's let him have another shoot <VOCNOISE> he gets two more minutes to try to get it <IVER>
and we'll just watch <VOCNOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> come on scooney <VOCNOISE> he made it okay he made it in <VOCNOISE> three minutes <VOCNOISE> thirty seconds left he made it <VOCNOISE> we win now <VOCNOISE> does that make the game interesting to you 
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> if <CUTOFF-w=we> if we really score sports <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> the game of sports not the <CUTOFF-administra=administration> the administration of sports is just as unethical as the business world <SIL> it is <SIL> unethical <VOCNOISE> and it's one of the biggest problems we have in our society <VOCNOISE> because we've emphasized <VOCNOISE> sports <VOCNOISE> along with the theater <VOCNOISE> as being <SIL> oh the <VOCNOISE> way to <EXT-go> <VOCNOISE> and that the poor <VOCNOISE> the poorest benchmarks you could have <VOCNOISE> in terms of financial <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> appreciation <VOCNOISE> sure you <UNKNOWN> thing is you <VOCNOISE> market demands the uh dollar that type of thing well yeah <VOCNOISE> let them do it <VOCNOISE> but the thing is <VOCNOISE> it gets almost be <UNKNOWN> like a lawsuit case <VOCNOISE> we are <VOCNOISE> crazy and insane people <VOCNOISE> again gets back to <VOCNOISE> ethics <VOCNOISE> do you think <VOCNOISE> do you think i'm worth <VOCNOISE> thirty million <EXT-dollars> <VOCNOISE> let me ask you let <VOCNOISE> let me ask you question <VOCNOISE> why in the hell are you coming and asking for thirty million <EXT-dollars> <SIL> don't you think you're <VOCNOISE> <EXT-uncouth> <IVER>
and yet <VOCNOISE> we sit down and negotiate for it <VOCNOISE> and then on top of it <VOCNOISE> those people that participate in the <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> sponsors <VOCNOISE> are <VOCNOISE> just as bad <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i think it was then <VOCNOISE> a nice thing about we <VOCNOISE-had> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> we had uh <SIL> grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state <SIL> in some cases <VOCNOISE> we didn't see them that much <VOCNOISE> we made a part that <VOCNOISE> uh we communicated with the grandparents regularly <SIL> and when we did <CUTOFF-i=it> it was a special <EXT-time> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-we> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> emphasized the fact that <HES-um> <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> yknow kids wanna do certain things okay they saw their mother <VOCNOISE> go out and maybe <EXT-do> some additional things to work for that <VOCNOISE> uh the aspect <VOCNOISE> we uh asked them if they wanted to go on um <VOCNOISE> a project with the class so forth fine <VOCNOISE> but you gotta participate in it too we we'll match you with what you come up with <VOCNOISE> we made them part of the <EXT-owner> <SIL> we gave them responsibilities <VOCNOISE> they grew up with the aspect <VOCNOISE> they learned by being around <VOCNOISE> some older people <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> which uh i think was good <IVER>
because uh again i said you <VOCNOISE> bring up you get wisdom from that as long as you're listening to them <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <EXT-some> people <SIL> i don't care what their age was they just blew them <EXT-off> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <SIL> and so that plus you have they <VOCNOISE> i think a understanding of um <VOCNOISE> the schooling <VOCNOISE> they came from <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools <VOCNOISE> i certainly did not want them to go to public schools <VOCNOISE> and even when going to ohio state <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> compared to miami university i saw a difference i see a differences in the standards of the of the students <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i believe and i've seen it with my son going to ohio state that his <VOCNOISE> morals <VOCNOISE> that he's gained through his uh <VOCNOISE> pre-college years <VOCNOISE> are staying with him <VOCNOISE> uh and i'm very grateful that there's uh spiritual guidance i keep telling these guys <VOCNOISE> guys <UNKNOWN> my daughter and son <VOCNOISE> excuse me <VOCNOISE> that um <SIL> yknow they'd come to me for <VOCNOISE> answers <VOCNOISE> now i think <VOCNOISE> now i <EXT-know> that's something that's probably the other problem is sometimes maybe the <CUTOFF-s=?> <VOCNOISE> the the <HES-um> siblings <EXT-or> the children do not have a parent to go to <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> again let me <ERROR-arate=reiterate> <CUTOFF-rei=reiterate> reiterate <VOCNOISE> we don't have a smooth marriage <VOCNOISE> they saw us have difficult times <VOCNOISE> and they saw us <SIL> saw us our spouses crying together <VOCNOISE> forgiving one another <VOCNOISE> arguing with another <VOCNOISE> just as much as you can have a being human relationship they saw that <VOCNOISE> they saw the love for one another <VOCNOISE> they saw <VOCNOISE> over night where i'd start take caring for my dad <VOCNOISE> because my mother died instantly yknow like short term an hour <VOCNOISE> and now he has a stroke <NOISE> i didn't know whether <VOCNOISE> i stay out of their <EXT-lives> <VOCNOISE> and i had to learn all that <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> i had <VOCNOISE-take_care> of <VOCNOISE-him> but then they saw my <EXT-wife> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-taking> over some my role at <EXT-home> <VOCNOISE> so we swing them that's why i said a team <EXt-player> <VOCNOISE> we knew what we had do <VOCNOISE> uh my son might come home i said well gee yknow he he he might smart off my wife will say hey <SIL> that's your dad give him respect <IVER>
oh <VOCNOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> okay it's part of growing up <UNKNOWN> and i i've been there done that too but still <VOCNOISE> you have to <VOCNOISE> you have to um <VOCNOISE> know there's respect out there to be warranted <VOCNOISE> and you expect it <VOCNOISE> and not just <SIL> demand it <VOCNOISE> you got to <VOCNOISE> you have to work to show <VOCNOISE> respect and then you should get respect for it <VOCNOISE> but then <VOCNOISE> they saw the interaction with the elderly people <VOCNOISE> the school he went to <VOCNOISE> a lot of public involvement public service required <VOCNOISE> the teachers <VOCNOISE> i often ask the teachers i've gone to sporting events <VOCNOISE> and their teachers are there <SIL> ticket <EXT-takers> <VOCNOISE> uh monitoring the crowd wherever the kids <VOCNOISE> i ask them i said do you guys ever go home <VOCNOISE> said <EXT-no> <VOCNOISE> oh yeah i said <VOCNOISE> but they're always there <VOCNOISE> they're not there just teaching a class <VOCNOISE> they're not there <VOCNOISE> preparing the class <SIL> they're there <VOCNOISE> after the class they're there for the student <VOCNOISE> and they make the student feel part of the family <VOCNOISE> that is a continuation of my philosophy at home <VOCNOISE> we interact <VOCNOISE> the school <VOCNOISE> is great <VOCNOISE> you have people that are on the clock oh <VOCNOISE> time to quit <VOCNOISE> they're gone <VOCNOISE> those people don't know meaning of life <NOISE> they will never know the meaning of life <VOCNOISE> but if they stay around <VOCNOISE> try to extend themselves little more with somebody that's having problems at work <VOCNOISE> and are willing to work with that person <VOCNOISE> i didn't say <VOCNOISE> willing to work <VOCNOISE> not knowing <SIL> they're going to be compensated <VOCNOISE> because they'll be compensated <SIL> not necessarily materialistically they'll be <CUTOFF-mantaw=?> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-then> <VOCNOISE> more than they're expected they'll be <VOCNOISE> recompensated somewhere <VOCNOISE> but the thing is to <VOCNOISE> lend an open hand <VOCNOISE> not knowing <VOCNOISE> well gee what's for <VOCNOISE> what's in it for me <VOCNOISE> what's in it for you is uh intangible <VOCNOISE> are you willing <IVER>
then <IVER>
then you have a choice there <VOCNOISE> you would not necessarily <SIL> uh have <SIL> you should've had more self control <VOCNOISE> and not had the child <VOCNOISE> don't expect me to pay for your <VOCNOISE> uh lack of uh will power <VOCNOISE> that's <VOCNOISE> that is <SIL> a selfish attitude <SIL> that's stealing <SIL> as well <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> i'm sure somewhere <VOCNOISE> i'm sure somewhere along the line that they would work things out to try to help her over those <VOCNOISE> bumps <VOCNOISE> it wouldn't be long term <VOCNOISE> and they would know that it would not be long term <VOCNOISE> but that's the intangible i'm saying you have somebody there because <VOCNOISE> she's giving up her time and not to make the high bucks <VOCNOISE> but <CUTOFF-sh=she> what she's bringing about is developing a character in a person <VOCNOISE> to bring about the spirituality in a person that's gonna carry them all through life <VOCNOISE> she's <EXT-also> <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> tithing <SIL> more than <VOCNOISE-tithing> probably <VOCNOISE> uh which uh i always uh kid with people i said the author <UNKNOWN> said ten percent tithing <VOCNOISE> knew inflation he knew great about <VOCNOISE> economics ten percent is ten percent <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> uh on top of that yknow <VOCNOISE> we talked about economics uh <VOCNOISE> little further here <VOCNOISE> uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and the <CUTOFF-chi=Chinese> and germans so forth <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> boy yknow <VOCNOISE> taking that page out of the old bible aren't they <VOCNOISE> we don't <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>

<SIL> gave me these leading questions and i said uh huh <VOCNOISE> i know where you're coming from i been confronted with that <VOCNOISE> when i was at ohio state and so forth <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> so i just layed it on the line to her <IVER>
in my own <VOCNOISE> civilian terms i said <VOCNOISE> why would you wanna give up on the original <SIL> yknow why would you wanna give up on the original have a copy <VOCNOISE> because all these others <VOCNOISE> wannabes <VOCNOISE> well in other words you follow christianity <IVER>
the catholic church is the first <SIL> christian church <VOCNOISE> and all the others <VOCNOISE> are fragments <VOCNOISE> they wannabe they still tie back to it but uh don't want <EXT-that> <VOCNOISE> it's like the commitment i was telling you <VOCNOISE> well i'd like to but <VOCNOISE> could you make a little extra <VOCNOISE> give me two more minutes to make that field goal <VOCNOISE> oh yeah we'll give you those but <VOCNOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> then we'll start we'll start only up here <VOCNOISE> and we <VOCNOISE> and we'll organize all this stuff but then we're gonna give two extra minutes in our rules <NOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> we gonna live this way and uh so forth <VOCNOISE> so we we <VOCNOISE> we develop things as they accommodate to our own selfish <EXT-beings> <VOCNOISE> not to the <VOCNOISE> sacrifice of what we should be doing <VOCNOISE> and we're all mortal and we're all gonna be <VOCNOISE> in that <VOCNOISE> and we're i'm not saying no one makes those errors makes errors it's always there <VOCNOISE> the problem is <VOCNOISE> to <VOCNOISE> try to stay focused <VOCNOISE> on that <VOCNOISE> not to jump ship <VOCNOISE> yknow they say in this country <VOCNOISE> oh you don't like leave it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
why would you wanna leave you said you're a third world country <VOCNOISE> why would you wanna be to table to i'd been <VOCNOISE> i wouldn't <UNKNOWN> this this country has a lot of problems <VOCNOISE> it's just like <SIL> my family has a lot of problems why would i <CUTOFF-w-aa=wanna> <CUTOFF-l-iy=leave> <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-p-r-aa-b=problems> <VOCNOISE> leave the family why would i leave the country <VOCNOISE> why not <VOCNOISE> work with it and correct it cause when i run away from it <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> yknow what i'm doing <VOCNOISE> i'm running into another chaos <VOCNOISE> at the other end <VOCNOISE> someone else coming the other direction <VOCNOISE> and they haven't resolved things <VOCNOISE> and that's been happening our society <VOCNOISE> we haven't <VOCNOISE> sit down <VOCNOISE> to learn <VOCNOISE> and understand one another f <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> as i told my <SIL> daughter when she came i said yknow <SIL> religion is is <VOCNOISE> is a business she says oh no dad it's not religion <VOCNOISE> i said it sure is a business <VOCNOISE> i said <VOCNOISE> it's just <VOCNOISE> the superficial things <VOCNOISE> the packages <VOCNOISE> are attractive to you <IVER>
and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite <SIL> article <SIL> every now and then <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> i said but when you get down to the meat <SIL> of it <VOCNOISE> it's the same thing <VOCNOISE> and i said <VOCNOISE> and that's where it comes down to <VOCNOISE> the catholic church for example <VOCNOISE> they can put all you can have folk masses you can do all this superficial stuff on the thing to make it more attractive <VOCNOISE> and they do every <VOCNOISE> every religion <VOCNOISE> makes it more attractive for her <VOCNOISE> oh as used to <UNKNOWN> come from oh yeah <VOCNOISE> but the bottom line is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're trying to still <VOCNOISE> if you're a christian <VOCNOISE> focus back to the bible <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> how do you do how do you get back to the original without <SIL> being part of the original <IVER>
well my question is <VOCNOISE> who's more important in our basketball team <VOCNOISE> the five starters or the sixth man coming off the bench <VOCNOISE> i ask you now who <VOCNOISE> ask george reese is he more <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> is he less important this year than he was last year <IVER>
well that i'm making an analogy with you women <VOCNOISE> who's more important <VOCNOISE> who saying <VOCNOISE> that not <VOCNOISE> being <VOCNOISE> not being a priest <VOCNOISE> is not important <VOCNOISE> being your individual <VOCNOISE> we're <VOCNOISE> all called to <VOCNOISE> be <VOCNOISE> important <VOCNOISE> a priest is just as <VOCNOISE> a occupation <VOCNOISE> a part of that society out there <VOCNOISE> he do <VOCNOISE> president of the united states isn't any better off than you are <VOCNOISE> he shouldn't be <IVER>
what <VOCNOISE> we're animals <IVER>
we're animals <VOCNOISE> everyone's looking for leaders <VOCNOISE> it's the rules of church simplest rule <IVER>
so if you want get to me two more minutes a play <VOCNOISE> okay now you got another leg <VOCNOISE> but the thing is <VOCNOISE> let me ask you question <VOCNOISE> how does that impact you if you can't be a priest <NOISE> aren't there <VOCNOISE> other <VOCNOISE> important <VOCNOISE> quote unquote <VOCNOISE> roles for women <VOCNOISE> in the church <VOCNOISE> aren't there other important roles <IVER>
aren't there other important roles <VOCNOISE> what would those nuns be <VOCNOISE> where would your mother <VOCNOISE> possibly been if she went to catholic school <VOCNOISE> i take it <VOCNOISE> where would she have been <SIL> if it weren't for the nuns <VOCNOISE> why we put nuns down <VOCNOISE> hey <VOCNOISE> they worked <VOCNOISE> lot less than your mother <VOCNOISE> is even getting compensated for <VOCNOISE> and they had a very important role <VOCNOISE> for <VOCNOISE> your <VOCNOISE> development <VOCNOISE> even though you're generation is removed <IVER>
well that gets back to what you're saying almost th the family life <VOCNOISE> hey what's ahead <VOCNOISE> what you don't need a <NOISE> husband all you need is a sperm bank <VOCNOISE> that's what you're saying aren't you <VOCNOISE> aren't you <IVER>
yes you are you're saying you don't need to have a leader <VOCNOISE> in the family <VOCNOISE> you <VOCNOISE> and if i'm gonna be a leader i'm gonna be the one <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna be the one not the sperm bank oh you came from this little tube here oh okay that's the principle family no i hafta be because <VOCNOISE> there's no father here <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<IVER>
again they set different roles <IVER>
the <IVER>
they set different roles up fine <VOCNOISE> give me two more minutes to play <IVER>
the problem is <VOCNOISE> lack of commitment <VOCNOISE> the lack of commitment <VOCNOISE> and not saying hey <VOCNOISE> there's a niche for you <VOCNOISE> you can't be a male <SIL> oh yeah you wanna do the operation i can't be feeling yeah you wanna do <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> why not be happy what you are god made you what you are <VOCNOISE> why not make <VOCNOISE> you the complete person you are <VOCNOISE> and not strive for something you can't <VOCNOISE> be <IVER>
that's the thing <VOCNOISE> but the thing is some people <VOCNOISE> some people say <VOCNOISE> some people say <VOCNOISE> well watch this the thing is <VOCNOISE> why don't you talk to those people and say hey <VOCNOISE> why not <VOCNOISE> do what i'm doing best <VOCNOISE> in other words compliment the team <IVER>
yes <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
so we lower the standards to meet that <IVER>
product certain things <SIL> but they <VOCNOISE> they want everything to be the same they can't be <SIL> they can't be the same it's just a natural thing <VOCNOISE> but the thing is <VOCNOISE> let them <SIL> do what they can <VOCNOISE> that's a god given talent what you have there <VOCNOISE> okay nurse <VOCNOISE> and how many refuse the nurse voluntarily <VOCNOISE> when they have children <VOCNOISE> why <VOCNOISE> talking among you women folk <VOCNOISE> why <VOCNOISE> do you have well i don't want to <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> you have the natural ability <VOCNOISE> to give all the <VOCNOISE> all the natural protein the immunization things all that maternal milk why can't you instead of getting off the shelf <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
it's just a rule <IVER>
it's a rule coming down hand down <IVER>
tradition <IVER>
there's a tradition <VOCNOISE> you see now you're looking you're looking for reasons <VOCNOISE> that's <VOCNOISE> looking for science <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> go back and ask them <UNKNOWN> as as as i would ask uh uh my uh <VOCNOISE> english teacher in school uh <VOCNOISE> anybody that said well what this poet <VOCNOISE> uh what was his <VOCNOISE> now he wrote this <EXT-poem> <VOCNOISE> um <CUTOFF-g-ah=?> i gave my interpretation no no now they say <VOCNOISE> no no that wasn't it <VOCNOISE> they share their thought <VOCNOISE> how do you know that was it <VOCNOISE> he's been <VOCNOISE> dead <IVER>
so how do you know <VOCNOISE> how do you know <IVER>
as a teacher how would you <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> how could you cut down a student and say no that's not the way it was <SIL> and it's nothing <SIL> you're learning from a teacher's guide <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> no but how do you know if i ask in the first <VOCNOISE> but it's a matter of tradition of handing it down to the tradition <VOCNOISE> itself <VOCNOISE> it's a matter of having in your family <VOCNOISE> what did your parents think of this way and that way <VOCNOISE> and it's <VOCNOISE> it's not <UNKNOWN> necessarily <SIL> written down but it's passed on those days probably written down or not written down but <VOCNOISE> verbal <VOCNOISE> and extended <VOCNOISE> and so it's that <SIL> hand down from generation 
those were the good old days <VOCNOISE> that's a good old day that's when you used to own them too <VOCNOISE> you could trade them <UNKNOWN> that <VOCNOISE> that's when we lost our rights <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> there are some things that are traditional that are <VOCNOISE> capital t and some are little t <VOCNOISE> little case t <VOCNOISE> and you're talking about little t case t <VOCNOISE> i'm talking about <VOCNOISE> capital t <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> i think everybody <VOCNOISE> should if nothing else you missed your boat <VOCNOISE> by that time <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
he has ah he hasn't questioned me like that but i see a lot of things coming out he's doing <VOCNOISE> more <VOCNOISE> in why he's been doing things about more differently than my daughter cause my daughter <VOCNOISE> was away at school and he's with us <VOCNOISE> everyday so he's home every doesn't wanna stay on campus <VOCNOISE> uh and uh <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> he does things voluntarily we don't have to <VOCNOISE> coach him he's working with a lot of other people i mean the <VOCNOISE> what he's been reared with coached with and so forth <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> somewhat imbedded <VOCNOISE> he sees that and matter of fact some of the girls he's <VOCNOISE> dating uh <VOCNOISE> they see that in him and i think that's a quality they <VOCNOISE> they say gee and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-th_a=thought> i i <CUTOFF-g=give> i give them thanks because uh say hey yknow it's it's rough out there because uh <VOCNOISE> and and the guys he runs around with <VOCNOISE> good quality guys i thought wow yknow <VOCNOISE> they're ornery sure <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i i wouldn't <VOCNOISE> i wouldn't trade his friends for anything gosh uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know how i came up with him i myself but <IVER>
which kids <IVER>
oh <VOCNOISE> they've been just troubled kids in the past they have <IVER>
yeah they were they were troubled kids in the past they came from troubled backgrounds they did <IVER>
well i'm saying but the <IVER>
oh i think uh <IVER>
i don't know there that much detail but most time it comes down to a lack of uh <VOCNOISE> knowing <VOCNOISE> your your children how they're gonna react to certain things <VOCNOISE> oh what it is uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know details with thing other than the fact that they're <VOCNOISE> seem like there's lot emptiness going on <VOCNOISE> uh with them <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> and i think that's part of problem we have in our uh in our life i've <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> it'd be very difficult um <VOCNOISE> i think uh <VOCNOISE> in our in traveling if you say okay i'm gonna give up this life here and go to the <VOCNOISE> third world and live <VOCNOISE> or else do less <UNKNOWN> less reverse bussing <VOCNOISE> hey okay upper arlington <VOCNOISE> you live northwest side why you down and live on the east side <IVER>
<SIL> why don't you live for a year <VOCNOISE> no not do it for a year <VOCNOISE> just go down for the day and then come back to upper arlington night and <VOCNOISE> live <VOCNOISE> how'd you like do that <VOCNOISE> hm <IVER>
no no <VOCNOISE> but that <VOCNOISE> but that's what i'm saying <VOCNOISE> but but that's that's what i'm saying and the same things happening when we had a bussing <VOCNOISE> we took kids out of the poor environment <VOCNOISE> and put them in <VOCNOISE> nice environment <VOCNOISE> oh they <VOCNOISE> they've got the taste of it then went back home <VOCNOISE> oh <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> and we did and <VOCNOISE> very unjustice thing to those kids <VOCNOISE> and to the families <VOCNOISE> and then when we broke them up <VOCNOISE> we did something else yknow take them out <VOCNOISE> then we lost that community involvement so now the parents can't follow their kids to their activities <VOCNOISE> get them splitting it up hey <VOCNOISE> we don't want them we don't want a families <VOCNOISE> that's a <VOCNOISE> misnomer they said <VOCNOISE> the fam <VOCNOISE> the community <VOCNOISE> raises the family <VOCNOISE> the kids <VOCNOISE> yeah that's how they want you to think <VOCNOISE> but the family the community will not re-replace the family <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> grand cayman <IVER>
just my wife and i this time <IVER>
i <CUTOFF-t_r_ah=travel> <CUTOFF-t_r_ah=travel> <VOCNOISE> traveling has been <UNKNOWN> even for the transportation department i travel across the state <VOCNOISE> and country <VOCNOISE> and before that i was always traveling we took <UNKNOWN> two weeks off when we go back <CUTOFF-s=?> <VOCNOISE> to fall semester <VOCNOISE> that time it was semesters not quarters <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> uh get on the greyhound bus fifty dollar pass was buddy and i we'd just travel <VOCNOISE> all over the country and sleep on the bus at night <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> i enjoy traveling i enjoy meeting people when i go on these <VOCNOISE> these travel things i have to for business i meet <SIL> with the uh <VOCNOISE> the the ships and so forth go back behind but then <VOCNOISE> when i go to the ports <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> the companies pretty much know what they <VOCNOISE> contract with us <UNKNOWN> i like to meet with the people there <UNKNOWN> the gestapo and so forth i'll talk with them and <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> learn more about <VOCNOISE> their little <VOCNOISE> uh things just like <NOISE> down in saint croix last year uh <VOCNOISE> spent two hours talking to the security there and he said <VOCNOISE> boy there's something wrong you guys from the continentals <VOCNOISE> i said continental <VOCNOISE> that's what we call you guys from the states <IVER>
oh boy <VOCNOISE> i said <VOCNOISE> and <UNKNOWN> this <VOCNOISE> and here <VOCNOISE> i here <UNKNOWN> i come from this is a gentlemen that's uh <VOCNOISE> dark skin <VOCNOISE> i don't know if he's black or colored <SIL> i'm still confused as to what difference in black and colored is <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> he says <VOCNOISE> yknow my brothers probably came <VOCNOISE> to these islands to the to the continental <VOCNOISE> they come down here <VOCNOISE> and they're getting all <UNKNOWN> they're swaying themselves they're <VOCNOISE> acting cocky to me and so forth <VOCNOISE> and i say <VOCNOISE> we don't do that here <VOCNOISE> and i said well i know this yknow <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> there's a lot of black population here <VOCNOISE> creole mix and that type of thing <VOCNOISE> which i would consider colored not black <VOCNOISE> uh to me black is black <VOCNOISE> if you have anything mixed in you it's colored <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> he said uh <VOCNOISE> we don't <SIL> do that <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> he said <VOCNOISE> problem in the states gosh you guys <CUTOFF-k-aa-r=?> <VOCNOISE> daddy wants <VOCNOISE> kid wants a car get him a car <VOCNOISE> down here <VOCNOISE> child only comes from the school <VOCNOISE> i uh i gave him a dinner <VOCNOISE> but i ask him to sweep off the front porch <VOCNOISE> now i'll still give him his dinner but i ask him please did you do your <VOCNOISE> sweep the front porch <VOCNOISE> may not sound much but at least i'm trying to teach him something <VOCNOISE> and you <VOCNOISE> you saw all that down there <VOCNOISE> in the people where we were down <VOCNOISE> fredericksburg <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> it it's it's just those things you you learn and and there's other times i was down in jamaica and you went back into the back country and you saw <VOCNOISE> very impoverished uh area so i <IVER>
almost made a mission film where the families living with the animals in the same house <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> you try to understand and <VOCNOISE> and you you'll never <VOCNOISE> they'll never get away from poverty and the classes in our society that's just <VOCNOISE> life there's always gonna be that but the thing is <VOCNOISE> try to have understanding compassion for them and try to reach out and <VOCNOISE> sometimes the people don't <SIL> want it <SIL> either <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> sometimes you can see well now i know why they don't want it because they don't know they don't know how to handle it <VOCNOISE> they appreciate the thought <VOCNOISE> that goes a lot longer than just giving them that <VOCNOISE> because if they get it they don't know what do with it <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i i really <VOCNOISE> i really think uh <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> as i was saying traveling <VOCNOISE> uh people are all the same worldwide <VOCNOISE> they just give them different colors different facial <VOCNOISE> different accents <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-d_ih=different> so god can give them <VOCNOISE> unique characteristics so he can call them his own <VOCNOISE> and he knows each every one of us <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> we're all the same it's down to talking about the emotions and <VOCNOISE> the drive <VOCNOISE> and i keep asking her keep a <VOCNOISE> one thing to ask yourself <VOCNOISE> and ask the business person <VOCNOISE> what would you be doing <VOCNOISE> today if you were born in a third world country <SIL> how thankful are you that you're here <VOCNOISE> and how do you show that thankfulness <IVER>
you're you're here for a reason <VOCNOISE> and you're here in the united states for a reason <VOCNOISE> of all the beatitudes you have here <SIL> don't you think it's time to share some of those things the talent <VOCNOISE> and to <VOCNOISE> not necessarily be recognized for those things but yknow some <VOCNOISE> some personalities require personalities that's the way it is but <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> to do things without expecting something in return <VOCNOISE> that would be so nice to see that written on magazine fronts oh yeah yeah <VOCNOISE> we're not <VOCNOISE> wow what's getting into these people they're not thinking <VOCNOISE> yknow if we can teach people to think <VOCNOISE> the way you're trying to tell me well <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> businesses tell us we should do this <VOCNOISE> then why doesn't business <VOCNOISE> take a more <VOCNOISE> social correctiveness <VOCNOISE> not political correctness <VOCNOISE> no <VOCNOISE> yeah the they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> deduction allowances <VOCNOISE> because even when we reduce deductions it went down to <VOCNOISE> yeah 
<IVER>
<SIL> no <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-the-they> they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> deduction allowances <VOCNOISE> because even when we reduced deductions it went down too <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> and then again <VOCNOISE> uh you say well <VOCNOISE> yknow like well maybe some affluent uh person would donate and it's publicized <IVER>
donate so much don't know <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> okay well that you remember <VOCNOISE> back sometime in may were ninety percent tax brackets and so forth <VOCNOISE> so that means ninety cents on that dollar he gave <IVER>
they didn't <CUTOFF-br=bring> they didn't bring that up <UNKNOWN> <SIL> he only gave ten cents <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> again it gets back to the ten percent tithing <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> i think there's something else in the bible where you know she <UNKNOWN> the <VOCNOISE> lady gives gives <SIL> only a small portion compared to a larger portion but <VOCNOISE> in relation to what her income was <SIL> that meant a lot more <VOCNOISE> and that we need to get more involved in that <VOCNOISE> we need promote more of that <VOCNOISE> if we're going package things materialize we need to think more of that <VOCNOISE> but i think really take hold of the night <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> what would you be doing if you're a third world country didn't have choice <IVER>
<HES-you> you <VOCNOISE> why you be doing eight children <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
trying to feed eight children <VOCNOISE> and it <VOCNOISE> if you're here in a <CUTOFF-c=country> this country <VOCNOISE> any eight children <VOCNOISE> why you have eight children to start with <IVER>
shouldn't you have little more knowledge little more <SIL> support around you <SIL> educating <SIL> knowing <SIL> self discipline <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> on what's on really on top what's really in crazy is when you have <VOCNOISE> multiple fathers <SIL> and the children don't know the dads <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that comes back to the lack of our morals and the lack of <CUTOFF-self=UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> and our society promotes it <SIL> they're doing a <UNKNOWN> to tax laws in our uh all the government <VOCNOISE> you see government do this government's doing it to themselves <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
again gets back to being in the home <VOCNOISE> did your mother give you everything you wanted <VOCNOISE> then she failed you didn't she <IVER>
not really <IVER>
well according to the government she would have <IVER>
and you don't the problem is as a youngsters you grow up <VOCNOISE> you don't realize how much your parents did for you until you're <VOCNOISE> probably until you're about thirty <EXT-five> forty you don't realize my goodness mom and dad you made a sacrifice <VOCNOISE> because now i'm learning a little more what you did <VOCNOISE> and then by the time you're <VOCNOISE> uh maybe <VOCNOISE> sixty <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fifty sixty now you got <ERROR-stay_care> <VOCNOISE> take care of your parents <VOCNOISE> if you have the morals to do it otherwise just ship them off to the farm <IVER>
and there's people like that today still <VOCNOISE> you go <VOCNOISE> but i think people should go to <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> retirement centers <VOCNOISE> uh huh <SIL> uh and uh sit down make a visit to them <VOCNOISE> every <VOCNOISE> week <VOCNOISE> make it part of life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and develop a friendship <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you'd learn a heck a lot from that uh <VOCNOISE> aging person <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a heck a lot more than you would <VOCNOISE> through interviewing me <VOCNOISE> really <IVER>
no <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> i'm living <VOCNOISE> yeah that's my <ERROR-my_di=UNKNOWN> my um role call <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> that's the generation i'm talking about those are generation <CUTOFF-th=they> they they went through the depression and so forth they <VOCNOISE> they were the <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i i pity i feel sorry for your generation <VOCNOISE> which is my daughter's generation and uh <SIL> part of my son's <VOCNOISE> i because um <VOCNOISE> i <ERROR=g=UNKNOWN> <SIL> i <SIL> i don't see how in the heck the wages aren't going up that much <VOCNOISE> prices are up consumerism's going up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> somewhere along the <EXT-line> <VOCNOISE> uh the consumer is going to have to start getting a little wiser <VOCNOISE> and say well <IVER>
what do i want out of life <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> the trouble is <VOCNOISE> if he does get wiser too much he's usually about forty years of age and he says gosh darn it i wish i listened <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <ERROR> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> it <VOCNOISE> it would be interesting <VOCNOISE> to see <VOCNOISE> how much of your generation <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is saving <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-h=how> <VOCNOISE> first of all how much they earning <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> how much they expect to pay for a house <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and all these other things <VOCNOISE> know they they say to you why well i'll save ten percent church <VOCNOISE> then you got <VOCNOISE> oh gee five dollars here <CUTOFF-thr=three> or <SIL> <CUTOFF-may=maybe> twenty cents a <UNKNOWN> twenty cents an hour <EXT-here> you this <VOCNOISE> you figure all those up <SIL> all these campaigns you hear during course a year <VOCNOISE> i often thought it would be great for marketing <VOCNOISE> take all those figures <SIL> and add up and see if it adds up to a hundred percent <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and if it does <VOCNOISE> then where are your goals <SIL> <VOCNOISE> see when i bought a house <VOCNOISE> the financier <VOCNOISE> <SIL> came in i went to his office and he said <VOCNOISE> oh mister <EXCLUDE-name> no problem no problem <VOCNOISE> you can get that house <SIL> i said <SIL> i can <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> you're professional and you're wife's professional <SIL> i said that's how you're evaluating it <SIL> on both of us yes <VOCNOISE> i said then i don't want to do business with you <SIL> why i'm going give you a loan i said <VOCNOISE> i don't want do business with you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because you didn't ask me about my goals <SIL> <VOCNOISE> my goals was not to have my wife <SIL> work <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because nowadays <VOCNOISE> takes two of them to work <VOCNOISE> i'm <CUTOFF-der=wondering> wondering when they're going to child labor law <SIL> uh revoke that <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> with two of them working <VOCNOISE> i'm wondering how many more hours a day <VOCNOISE> you can squeeze out of a couple's personal life <VOCNOISE> so they'll have sanity <VOCNOISE> at some time in their life to enjoy life <VOCNOISE> when these people start realizing <VOCNOISE> hey <CUTOFF-w=we're> <VOCNOISE> it's <CUTOFF-i-it> <SIL> we're chasing our tails <VOCNOISE> then those two <CUTOFF-coup=couple> that that couple <SIL> got wise and said hey <VOCNOISE> we're going to do with less <SIL> and we're going go for quality <SIL> <VOCNOISE> when that <VOCNOISE> when that couple reaches that mentality <SIL> mister loan officer <VOCNOISE> you're gonna have a greater society to work with <VOCNOISE> and you won't have as many repossessions <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm sorry it goes against your goal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but goes against <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> it's more positive for our society <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and that's been it <VOCNOISE> my wife's been working part time <SIL> all her <VOCNOISE> tenure that's fine keep her license up <SIL> she's a nurse <VOCNOISE> the thing is <VOCNOISE> i don't <SIL> want i didn't want her i wanted her to be home with the kids i didn't want somebody else to rear our kids <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and i don't know <VOCNOISE> if our kids realize this or not <SIL> but i do know my <ERROR> my <ERROR> my brother in law <VOCNOISE> mentioned to his uh parents he said <SIL> gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us <SIL> and he just turned fifty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they don't have any kids <VOCNOISE> and he says <VOCNOISE> wow i don't know how you did it <SIL> well for one thing they probably did <SIL> a lot of sacrificing <VOCNOISE> and when you sacrifice <VOCNOISE> it becomes <SIL> <CUTOFF-i-it> makes you more humble <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> and it makes you a <ERROR> a better person <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> you got the spirituality inside you driving you <SIL> and that's what's gonna take you home <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i often ask of people <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> you ask me about marketing <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ho-how> <VOCNOISE> uh do you think there's a heaven <SIL> <IVER>
and how do you picture it <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> okay <VOCNOISE> see <VOCNOISE> the way i look at heaven <SIL> myself is that <VOCNOISE> i have a chance to meet all my acquaintances i had over the past <IVER>
my family <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i'll see them face to face <SIL> and i'll recognize them <SIL> and they'll recognize me <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> something transcends them <VOCNOISE> because as i look to them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> unlike when they're on earth <VOCNOISE> my goodness we're taught to learn <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> the most negative thing about person <VOCNOISE> <SIL> psychology says if you see a blank sheet of paper you see the dot on the thing <VOCNOISE> you don't see the other ninety nine percent of the paper you see that dot <SIL> it's gonna be just the opposite in heaven <VOCNOISE> i can't think of a negative thing about you <SIL> and the reason why you can't think of a negative thing about them <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> you see christ's <UNKNOWN> appearance coming through them <IVER>
and they see the same thing it's mirrored back to them <VOCNOISE> because we're made in christ's images <SIL> and we can't say no to him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's what heaven's like that's what we should go to bed at night thinking <VOCNOISE> what did we do positive today <VOCNOISE> and build on the positive it may be the smallest part of that sheet of paper <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> i made a difference i helped someone 
<SIL> i listened to someone <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just touched someone <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> who will be successful <VOCNOISE> you will be successful <ERROR=individual> individual <VOCNOISE> and that's what's most critical <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you yourself has <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to do it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not the business <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because from you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> businesses observe <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>

<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
um-hum 
<SIL> beer bottles sure do <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
they're all <SIL> um <SIL> in business <SIL> uh they work <SIL> uh they're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> scattered <SIL> i have a son in sacramento and a son uh in <SIL> atlanta georgia <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and then i have a daughter in tulsa oklahoma and i have a daughter in ruston virginia <SIL> so they did they're all <CUTOFF-marrie=married> well <SIL> three are married yeah <IVER>
they're <SIL> they have a <CUTOFF-d=?> <SIL> very nice standard of living all of them do <IVER>
i have six <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i know it i know it but yknow there <SIL> there's um three three of the family three of the children <VOCNOISE> have <SIL> children <SIL> and they each have two <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's a <CUTOFF-bo=boy> <SIL> a <CUTOFF-gi=girl> in each one the girl is the uh <CUTOFF-y=youngest> uh oldest and then the boy <SIL> second <CUTOFF-y=?> <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's good though and i hope and i know my son who isn't married right now <SIL> he's um <SIL> thirty one i know that he wants children very badly so <SIL> so i should have probably end up with about eight or ten <SIL> i would <CUTOFF-ima=imagine> <SIL> i would imagine so <IVER>
grandchildren <SIL> um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
i thought was <SIL> forty three <IVER>
oh <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
but <IVER>
they were <IVER>
<SIL> they were all around the same age yknow and <SIL> going to college <SIL> my daughter julie does uh is very active though <SIL> in um <SIL> not necessarily that she <SIL> has adopted two her two children <VOCNOISE> so she's become very active in the <SIL> adoption procedure in tulsa <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <IVER>
oh okay okay <SIL> uh yeah as far as the siblings go bernie is uh does charitable work <IVER>
dorothy <SIL> uh <SIL> has a lot of <VOCNOISE> grandchildren and a lot of children she has six children so <VOCNOISE> i think her family is her <IVER>
within her <SIL> her life they she she does more with the children <VOCNOISE> because most of them live here <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-w=we> our children are all away so <IVER>
we have the time <IVER>
oh i would be surprised <IVER>
interactive they are <IVER>
i think my daughter jennifer is very active uh <SIL> um <SIL> not so much <SIL> um the <SIL> the type of work that i do but i think she's very charitable <SIL> very giving very um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
hum um <SIL> hum um <IVER>
and her family <IVER>
hum um <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i think i would say the same thing <VOCNOISE> because uh um <SIL> course <SIL> we had the benefit of having a mother <SIL> who was very giving i mean <CUTOFF-l=?> i think i learned a lot from <SIL> her selflessness <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> 
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> not only <SIL> toward with us the children but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just to <SIL> other also <VOCNOISE> yknow how mother used to feed the bums that would <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-f=front> up to front door and she'd fix them food and so she she was a very <IVER>
hum <IVER>
i i know i wasn't <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i think example is probably the best <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> they see that <SIL> you care and <SIL> they <SIL> learn to care <SIL> i think my son john he's the youngest i think he's a very compassionate soul <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh very spiritual young man <SIL> um more so than his brother is <VOCNOISE> and <EXCLUDE-then> i always have <CUTOFF-th=that?> ah have to weigh that <SIL> yknow they say that <VOCNOISE> sometimes <SIL> you give because it <SIL> makes you <CUTOFF-f=feel> you feel better to give <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i sometimes try to weigh that if <SIL> that's part of why <SIL> i <SIL> i <SIL> i <SIL> i can't believe it it's <VOCNOISE> an attention getter because <SIL> there's nothing to be gained by <SIL> getting attention for the works you do <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> but maybe just within maybe one feels <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <SIL> and i think <CUTOFF-w=we?> i think <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> it's a matter of being conscientious too <SIL> yknow conscientious that there are <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
less fortunate out there and that <SIL> <CUTOFF-l=?> there's little things we can do <IVER>
i think that's kind of where i'm coming from janet i know you <SIL> i janet <CUTOFF-J=Janet?> <SIL> i mean what <SIL> my sister does <CUTOFF-ah=I> i just say to her i just really admire it <VOCNOISE> i can't give as much as she gives i can't just don't have that same spirit she has but uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <ERROR-is=it's> great to see <SIL> i mean she's real <SIL> she really <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when she's with <SIL> the people <VOCNOISE> i don't know i have this <SIL> thing probably about me that yknow you can stand on your own two feet and you can <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lead a better life but janet just <SIL> envelops them with her kindness and um <SIL> probably has less expectations from <SIL> the people she works with <IVER>
hum <IVER>
oh <IVER>
help them <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>

three three out of my four children do <SIL> belong to the catholic church <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then my one daughter chose in living in oklahoma <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she is <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> a baptist church <SIL> but she's very active within the church very active through the sunday school and 
<SIL> through the woman's group and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not really but i think living in the bible belt as she did she was <SIL> living there ten years before she married <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh got involved in a youth group <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think that that was very influential on her decision and so she was married in the church all my other children were <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but yknow <SIL> she's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she is <SIL> going her own path and that's fine with me she's very good girl and she's very <SIL> conscientious and <IVER>
no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as <SIL> the rest of the children did <SIL> but no <SIL> i'm <SIL> i'm very happy and content with <CUTOFF-he=her> <SIL> her decision <SIL> yeah <SIL> very much so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in <CUTOFF-f=fact> as a matter of fact ironically julie the tulsan <SIL> she and her husband both baptists <SIL> they have both their children in a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool and it's a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yes it's it's a catholic school environment so it'll be interesting to see what evolves <VOCNOISE> from <SIL> the children's <SIL> <UNKNOWN> uh <SIL> attention to <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> <CUTOFF-g=?> the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so <IVER>
oh i take the little ladies i take to church <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
they're two elderly women that at the church <CUTOFF-ab=about> it this has been about of seven or eight years ago <VOCNOISE> <SIL> father just mentioned that they had <SIL> a need <VOCNOISE> uh they had had a church bus and it had broken down so <VOCNOISE> they had a need for <SIL> to get <SIL> people to church and i met these two elderly women <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now <SIL> the one now is ninety she turned ninety last october and the other one is about <EXCLUDE-seventy?> <SIL> eight <SIL> now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they live together and uh <SIL> i take them to church on sunday <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH-take_them_to_the> grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i don't do it as regularly now because <VOCNOISE> of the advance in age yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and that they're at the nazareth <VOCNOISE> nazareth towers which is good because they they're <SIL> they get better care there <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
they're dear <IVER>
well it's not every sunday anymore uh but it was for a long time it was for a long time <IVER>
very slow very methodical we take them to <ERROR-dog=doctor?> my husbands taken them many times for <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when they had to have cataract operations yknow so <SIL> he's involved with the girls too <IVER>
oh yeah that was a that was a job helping them to move <IVER>
janet lou helped <IVER>
she helped a lot <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
doesn't bother me at all <IVER>
i see no <SIL> i mean it it <IVER>
oh well <IVER>
i don't believe that <IVER>
absolutely <IVER>
absolutely <IVER>
that was a lot of old thinking <SIL> <IVER>
there is very definitely <IVER>
i think they've tried to to uh bring the laymen in <SIL> to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> more of the priest <SIL> the duties of the priest <VOCNOISE> but there's like the consecration uh of the bread and wine that <SIL> that none of that has been sanctioned <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they don't perform they don't <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-t=?> <SIL> um they're not able to give the sacramental graces for baptism confirmation <VOCNOISE> <SIL> holy <CUTOFF-com=communion> uh well they do holy communion <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but uh extreme unction matrimony none of those <VOCNOISE> uh have been delegated outside of the duties of the priest <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i still think that it's a good uh <SIL> i do think the involvement of the laymen is very important <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i don't have any <CUTOFF-qua=qualms> <SIL> i i mean that doesn't bother me a bit about women <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
huh <SIL> uh <IVER>
well <IVER>
and i don't agree with that either <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
bar mitzvah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i've never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women aren't priests is because they <CUTOFF-c=can't?> don't <VOCNOISE> show any kind of uh spiritual leadership <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i've never heard that said <SIL> and <CUTOFF-s=so?> there must be people who <SIL> think that <IVER>
well when they had to cover their <CUTOFF-he=heads?> i know all of that but i don't think that's really been <IVER>
um-hum um <IVER>
i don't <SIL> think so <IVER>
well that's true <IVER>
that's right <IVER>
and they say not as many european men attend mass but in in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at church yesterday i <SIL> thought about that and i noticed how many men <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there are who do go to church in the united states <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i've always thought that it it ends up being <CUTOFF-r=?> <SIL> a personal decision <SIL> 
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i i said to myself because i had post partem depression with my third and fourth child <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i thought it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> what good am my going to be to these children if i'm not able to take care of them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> decision was said <SIL> after the fourth child we would practice birth control <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i and i felt comfortable that <IVER>
no because i think there's the ideal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> everything <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> if you can't live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do <SIL> and uh i think that's where i was coming from <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> even now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean i i could never <SIL> agree with abortion lets say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i i would stand by the church and and most <SIL> most of the church laws i do stand by <VOCNOISE> but i guess the birth control issue became so personal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with a <SIL> what i felt was a clear conscience and what i did <SIL> i don't have any regrets for it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what about you <IVER>
i think it has a lot to do with the fact that the <VOCNOISE> that they <SIL> the church <IVER>
yeah <CUTOFF-d=?> <CUTOFF-f=?> <CUTOFF-pro=procreation> <CUTOFF-t=?> procreation part of <SIL> what marriage is all about but i see marriage as <SIL> more than just propagating <IVER>
so that's <SIL> yknow <SIL> <CUTOFF-ba=based> <SIL> a lot of my decisions were based upon that <IVER>
they haven't <NOISE> hum um <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
well and don't you think too the <CUTOFF-psych=psychologically> that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the more they have found out psychologically speaking about <VOCNOISE> children and the placement of children in the family and the <SIL> um <SIL> throes of not having enough or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or being <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=sorely> <SIL> sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both <SIL> know the <CUTOFF-ek=experience> <SIL> that experience from being <VOCNOISE> <SIL> one of eleven children raised so yknow you didn't have the advantages that <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and of course i think too as in america the um <SIL> the <CUTOFF-f=farm> <SIL> farm families yknow they wanted <SIL> that was more laborers for the vineyards so to speak so i think that might have influenced a lot of that <VOCNOISE> but over the years it it um <SIL> it just made sense to me <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in fact it <VOCNOISE> looks like in my family that they're <CUTOFF-t=?> going <SIL> the children are going to be mostly in twos <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow not even going to three or four <SIL> i mean <ERROR-is=it's> <SIL> not over yet but my girls are forty two and <SIL> forty one <VOCNOISE> <SIL> soon to be forty one so um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think that their child bearing years are over <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>

<SIL> mean <SIL> the way i grew up it was probably like back in the day <SIL> like <SIL> the catholics against the columbus publics <SIL> yknow like <SIL> the richies against the poories <SIL> that's how i kind of see it <SIL> but when i went to northland people were <SIL> think <SIL> northland's like a rich school <SIL> but the way i see it is <SIL> no not really <SIL> i mean we do live in a big <CUTOFF-h=house> <SIL> yknow housed <SIL> area yknow the houses are like huge <SIL> but um <SIL> um <SIL> i mean columbus public <CUTOFF-s=schools> <SIL> they <SIL> they got some work to do too like <SIL> the other night i was watching tv and <SIL> uh <SIL> an elementary school <SIL> overdosed a kid on <SIL> like some <SIL> a <CUTOFF-d=drug> <SIL> i think it was a drug to <SIL> calm him down so he's not so hyper <SIL> and they like <SIL> overdosed him like twice in a day <SIL> and then when he goes home his mom's even overdosing him because he <SIL> they're <SIL> overdosing him <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i mean he's <SIL> he <CUTOFF-w=was> 
they were supposed to do it one time and then she was supposed to give him one <SIL> dose <VOCNOISE> and they were giving him three doses <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
whoops <VOCNOISE> that's <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't i didn't see that part i missed the beginning and <SIL> all i seen was <VOCNOISE> the the chart and i was like <SIL> whoa <VOCNOISE> yknow that <SIL> that's <SIL> one reason <VOCNOISE> why i would <SIL> hesitate to put my kid in a columbus public <VOCNOISE> just like um <SIL> the daycare <IVER>

whoa <IVER>
um <IVER>
hum <IVER>

<LAUGH> <IVER>
i don't know <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> i think it's kind of ridiculous <VOCNOISE> for kids to pay <VOCNOISE> to chew gum <VOCNOISE> yknow or <VOCNOISE> if they get caught chewing it desalles my all my cousins went to desalles <SIL> and <SIL> if they got <ERROR-chot=caught> <VOCNOISE> caught chewing gum <VOCNOISE> they had to pay <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they had the paid <VOCNOISE> i'm like what <IVER>
<CUTOFF-i=it's> it's a catholic school <IVER>
all the <VOCNOISE> i was like <EXT-no> i would not <VOCNOISE> i'll chew gum when i want <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> one of my friends <SIL> he had um <SIL> a car alarm <SIL> because he had some nice stuff in his car <VOCNOISE> his car alarm went off during <VOCNOISE> school and he said <VOCNOISE> he <VOCNOISE> put his hand up and everything and told her that he <VOCNOISE> needed to go outside because his car alarm was going off <VOCNOISE> and um she said no you can do that on your time sit down <VOCNOISE> he got all his stuff stolen out of his car <VOCNOISE> it's like <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> there that went yknow <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> why <VOCNOISE> i mean you can't even have nice stuff in your car anymore <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
i don't know i mean <VOCNOISE> i was actually looking at that riser military and then they started <VOCNOISE> popping up all this <VOCNOISE> abuse stuff and i was like <SIL> man <VOCNOISE> darn <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> it's like my aunt <IVER>
his <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my boyfriend's <VOCNOISE> aunt and uncle they <VOCNOISE> their <VOCNOISE> their kid is <SIL> has that <SIL> really hyperness um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
a d h d <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> they do this <VOCNOISE> they were trying to make it to where they <VOCNOISE> he would calm down and they wouldn't hafta give him so much medicine <VOCNOISE> and she reads a lot of magazines and <VOCNOISE> articles about <SIL> yknow the problem <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> i guess uh <VOCNOISE> he <CUTOFF-ha=had> <SIL> uh <SIL> if you change their diet if you take out milk or something i think it was <VOCNOISE> did you know twizzlers had milk in them <IVER>
you <CUTOFF-di=did> i <CUTOFF-n=never> <IVER>
oh really <VOCNOISE> i was like <VOCNOISE> whoa milk in twizzlers <IVER>
whoa <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
that that <VOCNOISE> it's like whoa <VOCNOISE> milk is in <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> so they change his um <VOCNOISE> diet around and watch i mean they're only <VOCNOISE> right now they're eating <VOCNOISE> they're on a <VOCNOISE> organic <VOCNOISE> diet <VOCNOISE> now i don't know if i could afford that but um <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
i would think it would be cheaper <VOCNOISE> organic food <IVER>
because i mean you could actually grow that stuff but it's kind of wintery now so <LAUGH> can't grow nothing right now <LAUGH> um <IVER>
it kind of <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> well i've seen worser <LAUGH-so> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> so i <VOCNOISE> they're doing this <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think it's called sit and reach where he's got to sit on the floor and he's got to raise his feet up just so <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and he's got to <SIL> take his hands and reach towards his toes <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> he they do that for <SIL> yknow like <CUTOFF-t=?> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> five minutes first time and they increase it <VOCNOISE> and he really hates it <IVER>
but it <VOCNOISE> it's teaching him discipline responsibility <VOCNOISE> you can't do these things at this time yknow <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
so he's not so crazy <VOCNOISE> she was doing this thing where um <SIL> if <VOCNOISE> he did a good <SIL> job on something she would give him like a fake coin <VOCNOISE> he'd put it in his bank <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> at the end of the week or something he could cash it in and get a video or a video game or something yknow <VOCNOISE> that shows responsibility <VOCNOISE> too <VOCNOISE> but <IVER>
hum <VOCNOISE> i think i'm gonna <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> what i really like the riser military because it shows discipline <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-re=responsibility> <SIL> responsibility <SIL> respect <VOCNOISE> for <VOCNOISE> you go to a columbus public school and <VOCNOISE> the kids will lash out on substitute teachers i think it's really crazy <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think you should have <VOCNOISE> a lot more <VOCNOISE> respect for <VOCNOISE> your elders your adults <IVER>

<SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> her husband works for a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a uh <VOCNOISE> testing <VOCNOISE> company <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> does <VOCNOISE> testing with uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know very much about it <LAUGH> probably shouldn't even say <VOCNOISE> but <CUTOFF-e=?> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-u=ultra> <CUTOFF-ultravi=ultraviolet?> uh with uh <VOCNOISE> ultra or <SIL> <VOCNOISE> something or other ultrasound <VOCNOISE> equipment <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> it's really sort of interesting <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and let's see <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> my <VOCNOISE> my youngest son's wife is a <VOCNOISE> teacher in the <SIL> catholic schools elementary schools <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> my <CUTOFF-s=second> <VOCNOISE> my second son's wife <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> works <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> for the <VOCNOISE> columbus school <VOCNOISE> system <VOCNOISE> as a secretary and <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> actually transcribing notes for <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> people <VOCNOISE> who uh for men who've <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> are <VOCNOISE> writing books or papers or whatever <IVER>
and then uh <VOCNOISE> my <VOCNOISE> oldest son's <VOCNOISE> wife is <VOCNOISE> a secretary <CUTOFF-f=for> <VOCNOISE> in the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> in the school <IVER>
in a <VOCNOISE> she's <VOCNOISE> works <CUTOFF-i=in> <VOCNOISE> in a school building and <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-she> <VOCNOISE> she hears all the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> troubles and <NOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> sad stories <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-oh> let's see <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> that's basically <LAUGH> who i am <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> i we were in north africa first <VOCNOISE> for the north african <VOCNOISE> campaign when rommel was still <VOCNOISE> roaming and then <VOCNOISE> when uh <VOCNOISE> that ended up <VOCNOISE> in the summer of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> fall of nineteen forty two i believe <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> then we <CUTOFF-w=we?> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> were sent to italy i was in the field artillery outfits <VOCNOISE> uh six inch guns <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> well actually <VOCNOISE> a neighbor boy <VOCNOISE> whose <VOCNOISE> draft number was <VOCNOISE> smaller than mine <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know where he got the contact but anyway <VOCNOISE> he <VOCNOISE> went up to boone iowa and joined a national guard outfit <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> which was field artillery <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> with the expectation of their being mobilized <VOCNOISE> soon <VOCNOISE> which they were <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> so he <VOCNOISE> he was home one weekend and talked to me about it and i thought well <VOCNOISE> field artillery i was exposed to that when i was uh <VOCNOISE> in r o t c at ames <VOCNOISE> so i thought that's <SIL> be better than <VOCNOISE> carrying a rifle and <LAUGH> so i went up with him and i joined up <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> so anyway <VOCNOISE> we <ERROR-hand=had> <VOCNOISE> six inch <VOCNOISE> howitzers <VOCNOISE> which had a range of <VOCNOISE> about sixteen miles <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> the shells were <VOCNOISE> about ninety five pounds <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and they <VOCNOISE> the high explosive shells had thirty seven pounds of t n t in them <VOCNOISE> so they'd make <VOCNOISE> quite a bang when they went off <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> field artillery is really <CUTOFF-inter=interesting> or i found it really interesting because <VOCNOISE> those uh <VOCNOISE> when you get into figuring <VOCNOISE> firing data <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-you_can> <VOCNOISE> get lost in mathematics almost back then you could of course <VOCNOISE> now they probably have <IVER>
computers that <VOCNOISE> figure it out and just zip zip <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> oh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then they uh <VOCNOISE> we had to <VOCNOISE> locate our positions on a map <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> i didn't do that myself <VOCNOISE> but we had a couple boys in the outfit who <VOCNOISE> <SIL> could <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> find where we were on a map and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> where our <VOCNOISE> o p our observation post was and <VOCNOISE> where the enemy out here was and all that <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> it's uh <VOCNOISE> it <CUTOFF-re=really> it is <CUTOFF-inter=interesting> was interesting <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> calculating <VOCNOISE> trying to calculate <VOCNOISE> where your shells were gonna land out there <IVER>
i was up <CUTOFF-o=on> <VOCNOISE> i was <VOCNOISE> only on the o p a few times but <VOCNOISE> one time when we <VOCNOISE> had a uh <VOCNOISE> second lieutenant up there who was very <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well congenial i guess is as good a word as any <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> what we'd do is sometimes <VOCNOISE> when we'd get into an area and we'd know that we'd had a field out here we'd be shooting to <VOCNOISE> we would adjust on a target out there we'd pick a <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
a building or some target there we could see <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and we'd <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ad=adjust> adjust the guns call down <VOCNOISE> shifts <VOCNOISE> until they could come within <VOCNOISE> reasonable <VOCNOISE> close to that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and then <VOCNOISE> we we'd know where <VOCNOISE> to shift from there to another target <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> he let me fire it <VOCNOISE> one <LAUGH> once <VOCNOISE> range but <VOCNOISE> i got about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> fifty or seventy five yards from the <VOCNOISE> what we were shooting <LAUGH-at> <IVER>
which would <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> see with those <VOCNOISE> guns our of ours we figured <VOCNOISE> within ten <CUTOFF-f=feet> <VOCNOISE> ten yards was a hit <VOCNOISE> was a <CUTOFF-tar=target?> <VOCNOISE> and because <VOCNOISE> if you had one of those things <VOCNOISE> thirty seven <VOCNOISE> pounds of t n t go off within ten yards of it <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> 
<IVER>
we <IVER>
we had uh <VOCNOISE> counter battery fire we called it which <VOCNOISE> when they were shooting back at us <VOCNOISE> once <VOCNOISE> in north africa was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> kind of <VOCNOISE> scary <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> we were in position where we <VOCNOISE> <SIL> could fire on a <VOCNOISE> a uh tank battle that was going on we had a <ERROR-foral-forward> <VOCNOISE> forward observer up there <VOCNOISE> where he could look down and see the whole thing <VOCNOISE> and so he was adjusting fire and <VOCNOISE> i don't know how many <VOCNOISE> tanks they claimed that we hit but <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> course with ours <VOCNOISE> if you hit <VOCNOISE> you didn't have to hit them direct you could hit them right beside them and flip them over <IVER>
and they were out of it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so uh anyway <VOCNOISE> <EXT-we> <VOCNOISE> we had a fine field day that one day <VOCNOISE> uh firing at them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the next morning about ten o clock <VOCNOISE> we heard one <CUTOFF-t=?> <CUTOFF-co=come> uh heard a shell coming in and it was an air burst back of us about five hundred yards <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and then in a little bit there's another one <VOCNOISE> other side of us <IVER>
he was adjusting on us <VOCNOISE> and we <VOCNOISE> <SIL> couldn't do we didn't catch onto where it was right away but <VOCNOISE> by the time we <VOCNOISE> started <VOCNOISE> looking for our <LAUGH> holes which <VOCNOISE> weren't deep enough <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-f=?> realized that he was in a clump of <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=?> of cactus <IVER>
over on an adjoining hill <VOCNOISE> oh about <VOCNOISE> half a mile away i guess <VOCNOISE> and he was getting even for the day before <IVER>
but uh <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-the> <VOCNOISE> the first lieutenant who was <VOCNOISE> our um <VOCNOISE> in command of the battery at that time <VOCNOISE> said let's get the hell out of here <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> there was a <VOCNOISE> a wadi they call them it's like a <VOCNOISE> little deep wash <IVER>
that <VOCNOISE> ran down <VOCNOISE> oh a hundred two hundred yards from the gun position so <VOCNOISE> we took off down there <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and they <VOCNOISE> proceeded to set <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think they set two of our guns on <VOCNOISE> the battery i mean the <VOCNOISE> tires on fire <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and they set the ammunition on fire <VOCNOISE> they just <VOCNOISE> shot our gun position up pretty good <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> and that night <VOCNOISE> finally they <VOCNOISE> well i don't know exactly how we <VOCNOISE> we got a hold of back to our headquarters but anyway we did and <VOCNOISE> so they sent the <VOCNOISE> prime movers <VOCNOISE> which <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> the trucks which we moved the guns with <VOCNOISE> out <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> we hitched what was <CUTOFF-rem=remaining> remaining <VOCNOISE> of the guns on them and <VOCNOISE> went back wondering now <LAUGH> they gonna put us in the infantry or something we don't have any <VOCNOISE> artillery guns <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know it wasn't but <VOCNOISE> a couple or three days <VOCNOISE> they had <VOCNOISE> more guns i mean more artillery pieces up there for us to <VOCNOISE> use <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> one other time after in italy <VOCNOISE> or when we were in italy <VOCNOISE> we <CUTOFF-mo=moved> they moved us into a position that we should have never been in <VOCNOISE> we were <VOCNOISE> well let's see we come <CUTOFF-alo=along> uh around a mountain like there's a mountain here <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and there not a <VOCNOISE> real <CUTOFF-b=big> high mountain but a mountain <VOCNOISE> and in the front of it there was a little kind of a <VOCNOISE> dip <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and then on out and the <VOCNOISE> enemy was over there <VOCNOISE> well they put us in the front of that mountain right down <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<EXT-where> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't think that there's any question they could look right down our throats because <VOCNOISE> and anyway we fired a <VOCNOISE> a couple times from there <VOCNOISE> and they <CUTOFF-s=started> started firing back at us and man <VOCNOISE> scared me <IVER>
i had my <VOCNOISE> my head was that far below the surface <LAUGH> <IVER>
in a hole and i was still <VOCNOISE> uh shaken <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> and i don't remember <VOCNOISE> i think they put one of our guns out of commission that time but they didn't do <VOCNOISE> as much damage as <VOCNOISE> they might have <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> those were the two worst <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> things <VOCNOISE> when we were in north africa <VOCNOISE> there was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> one <VOCNOISE> german gun that was <VOCNOISE> firing on us and <VOCNOISE> and they couldn't figure where he was <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and finally uh i don't know whether there were <VOCNOISE> we had uh a <VOCNOISE> piper cub observation plane i don't know whether he saw him <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> who but anyway <VOCNOISE> they finally <VOCNOISE> figured that he was in a <VOCNOISE> a <CUTOFF-rai=rail> a tunnel for the railroad <IVER>
and he'd <IVER>
pull out <IVER>
fire a couple rounds pull right back in <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> that night our captain who <VOCNOISE> who's one of these <VOCNOISE> go go guys <VOCNOISE> took one of our guns from a gun crew <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they went up to where they could <VOCNOISE> line <CUTOFF-s=?> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> line <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> aim on that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
opening of that tunnel <VOCNOISE> and <LAUGH-they> <VOCNOISE> fired a couple <VOCNOISE> <SIL> of our shells into the tunnel and then took off <IVER>
so i don't know <VOCNOISE> whether <CUTOFF-th=they> <LAUGH> they did any damage or not but <IVER>
if there were any germans in there i'll bet they scared <LAUGH-them> <LAUGH> <IVER>
no <IVER>
no we we <VOCNOISE> the uh the only germans i ever saw were <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-pri=prisoners> <CUTOFF-pri=prisoners> p o w's <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well we <VOCNOISE> we went in <VOCNOISE> at naples <IVER>
which is pretty well to the south <CUTOFF-e=end> <VOCNOISE> end of italy <VOCNOISE> and we went up <VOCNOISE> through the <VOCNOISE> mountains we didn't see <CUTOFF-a=any?> <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> went up to uh <VOCNOISE> let's see now <VOCNOISE> well we went uh <VOCNOISE> about half way up to <VOCNOISE> between naples and rome <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and we were stopped at <VOCNOISE> one of their defensive lines <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> then <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> powers that be yknow <VOCNOISE> american army decided well <VOCNOISE> we'll go up to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> this little area of uh <VOCNOISE> oh i was there six months or four months <VOCNOISE> anzio <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
you've heard of the anzio beachhead <VOCNOISE> we'll go up there <VOCNOISE> and get around behind them <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh so they went up there <VOCNOISE> but the germans <VOCNOISE> caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot <VOCNOISE> and that <VOCNOISE> area <VOCNOISE> of anzio was <VOCNOISE> just flat as this table almost <VOCNOISE> for an area <VOCNOISE> back from the <CUTOFF-m=Mediterranean> <VOCNOISE> mediterranean back probably <VOCNOISE> ten miles <VOCNOISE> there's ten or twelve miles <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> long the coast long <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> so we the <VOCNOISE> we had enough area to <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-madip=manipulate> <VOCNOISE> manipulate in <VOCNOISE> and it was crisscrossed with deep <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> ditches of some kind i don't know whether they were <VOCNOISE> irrigation ditches or what <VOCNOISE> which we used as <SIL> fortification <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> but even so <VOCNOISE> the uh <VOCNOISE> we were on this and the <VOCNOISE> germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could <VOCNOISE> again look right down at us <VOCNOISE> so we didn't go out in the daylight hardly at all <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and then uh <VOCNOISE> after so long a time after <VOCNOISE> i don't know how long <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> again the powers that be said well <VOCNOISE> we'll fool them we'll <VOCNOISE> fog up that whole area with smoke <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and as long as the wind wasn't too <VOCNOISE> high <VOCNOISE> well they could do it <VOCNOISE> mean you <VOCNOISE> they <CUTOFF-f=fogged> <VOCNOISE> fogged it up to where you could hardly see your hand out here <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that way well at least we could move around a little bit <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
we sat there then <VOCNOISE> for <VOCNOISE> oh and <VOCNOISE> it was kind of funny <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> we were <CUTOFF-go=going> uh there's <VOCNOISE> another guy and i and <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> the <VOCNOISE> the lieutenant who was <CUTOFF-a=a(n)?> <VOCNOISE> forward observer <VOCNOISE> were going out to a <VOCNOISE> forward <ERROR-observe=observation> <VOCNOISE> observation post and <VOCNOISE> they uh <VOCNOISE> observation <VOCNOISE> lieutenant whatever his <CUTOFF-p=position?> title was <VOCNOISE> was guiding he was in one jeep ahead of us and we were following him <VOCNOISE> and of course we just had these little <VOCNOISE> red <VOCNOISE> blackout lights they called them <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
we were following his jeep <VOCNOISE> we kept going and we kept going and <VOCNOISE> this other g i and i were sitting in the back and i said hey <VOCNOISE> suppose they know the german <LAUGH-password> <LAUGH> <LAUGH_but> <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> anyway <VOCNOISE> they finally got out <VOCNOISE> we finally out out to where there was a bunch of <VOCNOISE> ruined farm <CUTOFF-hou=houses> <VOCNOISE> or <CUTOFF-fa=farm> ruined farm house and farm buildings and so on <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> they said well this is it <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> <EXT-we> there and there were some <VOCNOISE> g i's <VOCNOISE> <ERROR <VOCNOISE> infantry men around there and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we started looking around for a place to land i mean <VOCNOISE> got our bed rolls out <VOCNOISE> so on and <VOCNOISE> the next morning <VOCNOISE> i don't know i guess i was looking for a <VOCNOISE> somebody who had a fire there warm up some <VOCNOISE> some uh rice and something <VOCNOISE> anyway <VOCNOISE> one of the first guys i saw <VOCNOISE> was a guy that had worked with my wife in the office there <VOCNOISE> 
<IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i got some of the inside dope <VOCNOISE> on uh the area from him <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> they had <VOCNOISE> there's a <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether it been a large grainery or something that had a concrete floor <VOCNOISE> and some <VOCNOISE> industrious g i had <VOCNOISE> chipped a hole about <VOCNOISE> so big around in that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and dug out the dirt under it <IVER>
so that he got down in a <VOCNOISE> an area under that concrete floor <VOCNOISE> the concrete was about so deep which <IVER>
better than that much dirt <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-and_uh> <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> whenever they <VOCNOISE> we heard any <VOCNOISE> firing like it was coming toward us why <VOCNOISE> we'd <LAUGH> head for that hole <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh let's see <VOCNOISE> i've already told you more than i ever told anybody else i think <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <IVER>
at <CUTOFF-An=Anzio> at anzio you said oh <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
one of my kids got it for me <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-makes_our_generations> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-sound_like_heroes> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
well i don't think he <VOCNOISE> exaggerated but he uh <VOCNOISE> he was selective about the people that he <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he described in there <IVER>
which <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-was_the> <VOCNOISE> purpose of his book i suppose <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and of course bill mauldin was <VOCNOISE> the greatest <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_mean> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> you <CUTOFF-go=got?> have you seen his <VOCNOISE> cartoons and <VOCNOISE> uh haven't you <IVER>
well he <VOCNOISE> his two main <CUTOFF-car=cartoons> uh <VOCNOISE> main characters in his cartoons were willie and joe <IVER>
two <VOCNOISE> g i's <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> oh <LAUGH-they> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-they> <VOCNOISE> they saw the <VOCNOISE> the ragged end of the war <IVER>
according to that <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> i can't think what some of their observations were but <VOCNOISE> there's usually just one or two <VOCNOISE> lines of <IVER>
of dialogue under one of their <VOCNOISE> their cartoons and the cartoon told <VOCNOISE> most of it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-and> <LAUGH> there was one <VOCNOISE> where they were going along and <VOCNOISE> there's a little <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> scroungey looking dog about so long and about that high kind of following along after them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> joe <VOCNOISE> i'm glad that i finally <VOCNOISE> see somebody i can be sorry for that's worse <ERROR-ara??=off> worse off than i <LAUGH-am> <IVER>
what <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> under the conditions that had to prevail i was treated well enough <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it was uh <VOCNOISE> part of the time <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't feel like i've <VOCNOISE> <SIL> gained anything from it that i didn't deserve i mean <IVER>
in the way of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> benefits <IVER>
huh <IVER>
well that and <VOCNOISE> see uh <VOCNOISE> they had the g i bill of rights <IVER>
which was <VOCNOISE> a boon to <VOCNOISE> thousands and thousands of guys my age <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> when i started as an apprentice <VOCNOISE> in the shop they said well <VOCNOISE> we'll start you at a dollar an hour <VOCNOISE> well i thought that sounds pretty good yknow in nineteen forty five <VOCNOISE> in the fall of nineteen forty five <VOCNOISE> so then <VOCNOISE> as things worked out in washington d c <VOCNOISE> they came out with the g i bill of rights <VOCNOISE> we found out that uh that would apply to apprentices too <IVER>
and so uh <VOCNOISE> soon as my <VOCNOISE> shop found out that i could <VOCNOISE> draw that <VOCNOISE> whole <VOCNOISE> ninety dollars a month <IVER>
i mean whoo <VOCNOISE> they said well <VOCNOISE> since you're getting that <VOCNOISE> why we'll <VOCNOISE> cut <VOCNOISE> cut your pay back to what <VOCNOISE> you would <VOCNOISE> normally draw under the apprenticeship program <IVER>
which was fifty seven cents an hour <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> for a <VOCNOISE> to support a wife and a <ERROR-wall=small?> small baby on that was <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> kind of tough going <IVER>
well <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> i was <VOCNOISE> exposed to a lot of <VOCNOISE> men who were not <VOCNOISE> brought up with as i was <VOCNOISE> but there were a lot of them that were <IVER>
i mean uh <VOCNOISE> like uh <VOCNOISE> what's his name that who wrote the book you just <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i was <VOCNOISE> i think that he's <VOCNOISE> he's right that our <VOCNOISE> my generation <VOCNOISE> was <VOCNOISE> <EXT-more> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> oh <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i want to don't want to say spiritual but more morally <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well directed than <VOCNOISE> at least a lot of the <CUTOFF-pe=people?> kids today <IVER>
i don't say that of all of the <NOISE-kids> because i know that <VOCNOISE> some of them <VOCNOISE> were <SIL> brought up right <IVER>
but uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> well i was <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i was pretty well <VOCNOISE> established about responsibility and <VOCNOISE> that sort of thing before i went into service <VOCNOISE> i was the oldest son in a family of ten <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> i had some <VOCNOISE> family responsibilities <VOCNOISE> we were <VOCNOISE> my brother and i and my sisters <VOCNOISE> were active in the four h clubs <IVER>
which was a <VOCNOISE> a going thing <IVER>
at that <NOISE-time> <VOCNOISE> in the uh <VOCNOISE> thirties <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> and did i say we <VOCNOISE> went to church <SIL> fairly regularly but <VOCNOISE> to tell you the truth i can't <VOCNOISE> remember too much that i <LAUGH-was> taught then <LAUGH-but> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but i was exposed to it anyway and i'm <VOCNOISE> i'm sure that some of it <VOCNOISE> rubbed off on me <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> uh my youngest son <VOCNOISE> married a catholic girl who was <VOCNOISE> from a large catholic family <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> their kids are going to a catholic school <IVER>
now i think that <VOCNOISE> those four kids at least among my grandchildren <VOCNOISE> are <VOCNOISE> getting pretty much at the same <VOCNOISE> training that i did or maybe better than i got <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> my oldest son's two daughters <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-are> <VOCNOISE> well they're good kids and they're smart kids <VOCNOISE> but i don't think that they have the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> moral grounding <VOCNOISE> that uh <VOCNOISE> greg and beth's kids do <VOCNOISE> you said this is all confidential <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and my <VOCNOISE> but now my daughter's <VOCNOISE> my daughter has twin sons <VOCNOISE> who just <VOCNOISE> are a year out of <VOCNOISE> college <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i think that they are <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-w=one> <NOISE> <CUTOFF-w=one> they <VOCNOISE> one of them particularly is <VOCNOISE> i think in <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> good moral <VOCNOISE> good sort of guy and <VOCNOISE> the other one <VOCNOISE> i don't feel like i know as well but <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i really think that they're <NOISE> both <VOCNOISE> good <NOISE> <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> see <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
i can't <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> those kids are uh <VOCNOISE> they're lack something in their upbringing <VOCNOISE> and i don't know what it is <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> thank goodness none of my kids ever <NOISE> took that sort of attitude <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i'd like to <VOCNOISE> i'd like to think that my wife and i <SIL> set them a good example <VOCNOISE> my wife was a <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> very conscientious <VOCNOISE> hard working woman <VOCNOISE> she <VOCNOISE> established a <VOCNOISE> secretarial <VOCNOISE> business there at our <CUTOFF-ha=home> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> for several years <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> anything that went out of there was <VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> i mean <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> she did <VOCNOISE> well quite a lot of typing for students over here graduate students <IVER>
<SIL> and <VOCNOISE> so she i gave her most uh <VOCNOISE> credit for <IVER>
our kids' upbringing <VOCNOISE> her mother <VOCNOISE> was a <VOCNOISE> cousin of uh <VOCNOISE> james thurber <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> was a <VOCNOISE> a <CUTOFF-w=want a want to be writer i <CUTOFF-r=?> mean her mother was <VOCNOISE> she <VOCNOISE> she wrote a <VOCNOISE> well she wrote quite a number of poems and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> paid to have them published in a small booklet <VOCNOISE> and some of <SIL> some of them were <SIL> <VOCNOISE> real good and some of them <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> my wife <VOCNOISE> wrote some poetry too <VOCNOISE> she'd be down there typing <VOCNOISE> and she'd <VOCNOISE> she always had these uh <NOISE> spiral notebooks <VOCNOISE> and she'd <VOCNOISE> stop and <VOCNOISE> get an idea for a poem maybe from something she is working on or i don't know what but <VOCNOISE> but anyway uh <VOCNOISE> she <CUTOFF-di=did> she wrote <VOCNOISE> quite a few poems some of them <VOCNOISE> real good poetry i thought <VOCNOISE> most of them of <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> more or less a <VOCNOISE> religious nature <SIL> and <SIL> moral nature <VOCNOISE> in fact uh <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> uh the <SIL> desk that <VOCNOISE> she had we <VOCNOISE> we finished off part of our basement she had her office down there <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> her desk is still down there and <VOCNOISE> one of the typewriters that she used but it's <VOCNOISE> i don't know it's been disused too for too long i guess because i've tried type on it <VOCNOISE> it uh <SIL> doesn't shift like it should and so uh <VOCNOISE> but anyway <VOCNOISE> she hadn't <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> how many these spiral notebooks around <VOCNOISE> and she'd just write in them <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> since she passed away in nineteen seventy nine <VOCNOISE> i have run across <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> well i just <CUTOFF-fi=finally> finally decided well those notebooks are down there and <VOCNOISE> if i need one for something i'll just <VOCNOISE> go ahead and use it <VOCNOISE> and i've <SIL> run across a couple of her poems that i didn't <VOCNOISE> know anything about <IVER>
and then was <VOCNOISE> or uh <VOCNOISE> sort of <SIL> good <IVER>
uh huh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
huh <IVER>
i think so <VOCNOISE> although <VOCNOISE> she was <SIL> working at her <VOCNOISE> desk most of the time so that <VOCNOISE> she didn't give them as much attention as <IVER>
as uh <VOCNOISE> a lot of mothers do <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> she was there <VOCNOISE> and if they needed her <VOCNOISE> for anything or <VOCNOISE> needed her to say no to something <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> she was there <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> yeah i think that uh <VOCNOISE> that probably had something to do with it <VOCNOISE> and the fact that our kids knew <VOCNOISE> what <SIL> our moral beliefs were <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> my oldest son <VOCNOISE> uh completed <SIL> what they call the god and country award in the church <VOCNOISE> which is <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-acroia=requires> uh <VOCNOISE> requires about as much <VOCNOISE> work as uh <SIL> eagle award <SIL> in the scouts <SIL> it's a <VOCNOISE> a scout sponsored but church centered <VOCNOISE> uh award <VOCNOISE> and then my <CUTOFF-s=second?> second son <VOCNOISE> got a his eagle award in the scouts <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> kind of proud of that <VOCNOISE> because it <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well it's not something that a lot of kids do yknow <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
my oldest son <VOCNOISE> was in vietnam <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> in fact <VOCNOISE> he uh <VOCNOISE> let's see i <SIL> i <CUTOFF-spo=suppose> i don't remember but i suppose that they <VOCNOISE> had a draft <VOCNOISE> when he was about twenty one <IVER>
anyway he <VOCNOISE> he went in for <SIL> less than a year i think and then he was discharged <VOCNOISE> and then he was called back <SIL> in <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> sent to vietnam <VOCNOISE> and it was uh <VOCNOISE> sort of a traumatic experience for him <VOCNOISE> that i think he has pretty well come out of but <VOCNOISE> he was in a <SIL> rural area he never was <VOCNOISE> up where he was doing any shooting himself <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> he was on k p one day <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> he said they had a big <VOCNOISE> an area <VOCNOISE> out away from any of the other buildings where they burned trash and that sort of stuff <VOCNOISE> so <CUTOFF-h=he> he said the <VOCNOISE> mess sergeant says um <VOCNOISE> shoemaker take that <VOCNOISE> can of trash out and uh <VOCNOISE> and burn it and you <SIL> probably better use <VOCNOISE> take some gasoline to throw on the stuff <VOCNOISE> to get it to burn <VOCNOISE> so he did he went out there <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> threw some gasoline on it <VOCNOISE> not <VOCNOISE> knowing that one of the other <CUTOFF-k=K> <VOCNOISE> K P's had been there ahead of him <VOCNOISE> and thrown gasoline on it so there was <VOCNOISE> i don't know how much gasoline on it <VOCNOISE> when he threw a match on it <IVER>
it <VOCNOISE> burned his <VOCNOISE> his front anyway <VOCNOISE> he got his hands up in front of his face so it didn't <VOCNOISE> burn his face but it <VOCNOISE> burned his legs and his <SIL> stomach <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> so he was in a hospital in <VOCNOISE> japan for some time <VOCNOISE> and then <NOISE> came home <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> he never <SIL> would never say a lot about it <IVER>
but he just <VOCNOISE> didn't have a very high opinion of the army <IVER>
and then <VOCNOISE> a couple of years later <VOCNOISE> he was working on a job in <VOCNOISE> the columbus coated fabrics plant which is <VOCNOISE> plant that makes <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN-own> <VOCNOISE> coated fabrics <VOCNOISE> they make <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> the main thing is uh auto upholstery car upholstery <VOCNOISE> anyway <VOCNOISE> they had big <VOCNOISE> rolling machines that <SIL> rolled this stuff out <VOCNOISE> and there's fumes came off of it <VOCNOISE> so they had <VOCNOISE> a big hood and exhaust system <IVER>
above it <VOCNOISE> and periodically they would have to clean those out because uh <VOCNOISE> the fan would draw in addition to fumes they'd draw some lint off of this uh <VOCNOISE> so he was up on top on these rollers <VOCNOISE> cleaning out the hood <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> with supposedly <VOCNOISE> nonflammable <SIL> solvent <IVER>
but it wasn't because it caught <SIL> fire <VOCNOISE> and that time he was burned on the back <IVER>
<LAUGH> he'd been burned <LAUGH> front and back <VOCNOISE> he was in the hospital burn ward for <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> two or three weeks <VOCNOISE> and it <VOCNOISE> it was um <VOCNOISE> the year that <VOCNOISE> one of the years that <VOCNOISE> ohio state played in the rose bowl now <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's the nearest i can uh <VOCNOISE> identify the time <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-ti=time> during the time that he was there <VOCNOISE> a girl who he <CUTOFF-b=been> he'd been going with just <VOCNOISE> occasionally not real steady <VOCNOISE> was there to see him every day <IVER>
<LAUGH-and_so> <VOCNOISE> when <VOCNOISE> shortly after he <VOCNOISE> was healed enough to go back to work <SIL> why <VOCNOISE> they were married <IVER>
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and had the two daughters <IVER>
hum <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
that's too true <VOCNOISE> it's uh <IVER>
hum <IVER>
well 
<VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> objectives in vietnam <VOCNOISE> were never <VOCNOISE> clearly delineated <IVER>
and they were in italy <VOCNOISE> and europe <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> there wasn't <VOCNOISE> the definite <VOCNOISE> enemy <VOCNOISE> in vietnam that there was in europe <VOCNOISE> i think that's part of it <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> and of course the attitude of most of the <VOCNOISE> guys that went to vietnam was <VOCNOISE> a little bit different from <VOCNOISE> from where i was probably is a consequence of <VOCNOISE> our understanding of the <VOCNOISE> the uh <IVER>
objectives <VOCNOISE> because uh <VOCNOISE> when we went <NOISE> into the service and then went overseas our <VOCNOISE> objective was to <VOCNOISE> do away with hitler and mussolini <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know they <VOCNOISE> i'm just thankful that he <VOCNOISE> he wasn't in a <VOCNOISE> carrying a rifle in a rifle company or something because <VOCNOISE> that was rough <IVER>
<NOISE> he uh <VOCNOISE> told he never said much about it except he <VOCNOISE> told about <VOCNOISE> one time when he was in the <VOCNOISE> hospital <VOCNOISE> up in japan <VOCNOISE> after he was burned <VOCNOISE> he said that he was in a <VOCNOISE> ward with a bunch of other <VOCNOISE> burn patients and <VOCNOISE> and he said the <VOCNOISE> some of them and him included <VOCNOISE> were able to get up and walk around <VOCNOISE> so the <VOCNOISE> and i can see their philosophy the <VOCNOISE> medics <VOCNOISE> had the guys that could walk <VOCNOISE> help wait on the <VOCNOISE> guys that were bed bound <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> he was <VOCNOISE> had been helping <VOCNOISE> one guy that was <VOCNOISE> pretty bad off <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> and this guy passed away <VOCNOISE> didn't make it <VOCNOISE> and so they <VOCNOISE> started to put orrin get warren to <VOCNOISE> do something else <CUTOFF-w=with> <VOCNOISE> with some of the other guys <VOCNOISE> i'm through i'm not working anymore with them he told them <VOCNOISE> and they swore yes you are <VOCNOISE> he said what are you gonna do send me back over to vietnam <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but they sent him home <VOCNOISE> but he was <VOCNOISE> he was uh <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> not a very enthusiastic soldier i don't think at any time and <VOCNOISE> especially after he came home <IVER>
now what <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> i don't think that women should be on the front lines <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> some women <VOCNOISE> are <CUTOFF-phys=phsically> <VOCNOISE> are physically able to do <VOCNOISE> what's needed <VOCNOISE> some definitely aren't <VOCNOISE> of course there's a <VOCNOISE> same by the same token some men aren't <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> as <CUTOFF-a=as> as support <VOCNOISE> groups i think that's all right <IVER>
huh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i never heard a thing about it all the time i was in the service <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and i don't know <VOCNOISE> whether orrin did or not he's never said anything if he has <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> i think my attitude would be <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> don't tell and <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> the guys that <CUTOFF-co=come> <VOCNOISE> come out in a very <ERROR-vocishou=vociferous> <VOCNOISE> vociferously in favor of <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> publicizing it and all that <VOCNOISE> i don't see <VOCNOISE> what they expect to gain <VOCNOISE> i mean if <VOCNOISE> they <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> they uh <VOCNOISE> in fact i don't <CUTOFF-s=see> <VOCNOISE> i don't think that they do gain anything by it <IVER>
it wasn't publicized to the <VOCNOISE> degree that it is now <VOCNOISE> it seems like anymore nothing is sacred i mean as far as papers are concerned <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> there's something else that i <VOCNOISE> i guess i'm old fashioned but i don't think <VOCNOISE> we need all this publicity about <VOCNOISE> all the sexual escapades of all the <VOCNOISE> people that are <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-notari=notarized?> or <CUTOFF-no=notorious> <VOCNOISE> have <ERROR-notarious=notorious> <VOCNOISE> lives <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i just <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i think maybe i'm old fashioned but i <VOCNOISE> and they <VOCNOISE> i can hardly <VOCNOISE> conceive <VOCNOISE> anyone being <VOCNOISE> a genuine homosexual <VOCNOISE> i mean evidently they are <VOCNOISE> um but uh <VOCNOISE> it's so against human nature <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> or against conventional human nature anyway <IVER>
well there's been quite a change in attitude of <VOCNOISE> the general public i <ERROR-thinik=think> as far as <ERROR-wri=women_working> <VOCNOISE> work <VOCNOISE> women working away from home is concerned <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i'm glad that my wife <VOCNOISE> was able to work there at home <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> actually she worked in an office when our first boy <VOCNOISE> was just <VOCNOISE> small <IVER>
but uh <VOCNOISE> her mother <VOCNOISE> stayed with us for <VOCNOISE> several uh two or three years <VOCNOISE> and she was a baby sitter for our oldest boy <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> she said well <VOCNOISE> mary would just well go out and get a job <VOCNOISE> she doesn't need to be <VOCNOISE> sit around here <IVER>
i mean that was <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
she was a <VOCNOISE> mary's mother was a <VOCNOISE> kind of a <VOCNOISE> free thinking uh <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> not a liberal but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> she went out <VOCNOISE> when she was in her early twenties <VOCNOISE> went out to <CUTOFF-n=north> <VOCNOISE> north d or uh <VOCNOISE> north or south dakota one or the other and homesteaded <IVER>
on a homestead <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> then while she was out there <VOCNOISE> she met a <VOCNOISE> a cowboy who <VOCNOISE> was from also from ohio <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> they uh <VOCNOISE> they were married while they were out there i guess <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> she was <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> uh my son <VOCNOISE> used to say she was a piece of work she <LAUGH> she hadn't <VOCNOISE> definite ideas about <CUTOFF-e=everything> <VOCNOISE> pretty near everything <IVER>

<IVER>
was it what <IVER>
oh <IVER>
sometimes <VOCNOISE> she and mary had more <VOCNOISE> disagreements than i ever had with her <IVER>
she would <VOCNOISE> pamper the kids <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> from where we lived there <CUTOFF-w=was> <VOCNOISE> we lived just <CUTOFF-o=off?> i don't know whether you're acquainted with the north end of columbus but anyway indianola avenue is one of the main thoroughfares <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> we lived about a <VOCNOISE> a block and a half off of indianola <VOCNOISE> and then just <VOCNOISE> another block <VOCNOISE> was a small shopping center <VOCNOISE> where there was a <VOCNOISE> drug store and a <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-sh=?> barber shop and a <VOCNOISE> a ten cent store <VOCNOISE> theater <VOCNOISE> i forget a couple other shops <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> when orrin was <VOCNOISE> about <VOCNOISE> i don't know <CUTOFF-s=six> <VOCNOISE> five five or <CUTOFF-s=six> <VOCNOISE> maybe six or seven years old <VOCNOISE> he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there <VOCNOISE> at all <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> one day <VOCNOISE> grandma gave him <VOCNOISE> i don't know a quarter or something <VOCNOISE> and that burned his pocket till <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or <VOCNOISE> whether he went up <VOCNOISE> on his own but he went up <VOCNOISE> to the store <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether mary went up and got him or what anyway she found out he was up there <VOCNOISE> so <CUTOFF-anyh=anyhow> <VOCNOISE> when i came home she told me what had happened and i said well <VOCNOISE> that just can't be <VOCNOISE> so i took him downstairs and paddled him <VOCNOISE> and i've never been anything more said about it since then <IVER>
the only time i ever did <IVER>
paddle him but uh <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
well i <VOCNOISE> i told him <VOCNOISE> yknow i said <VOCNOISE> something we <SIL> told you you are not to do <IVER>
and you went ahead and did it <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
my parents homesteaded out there <VOCNOISE> in nineteen <VOCNOISE> eleven or twelve shortly after they were married <IVER>
they <VOCNOISE> they'd <VOCNOISE> go out there and there was um <VOCNOISE> i suppose it was a county seat town <VOCNOISE> and they'd file a claim on a certain area <VOCNOISE> of <VOCNOISE> land <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> it was surveyed off and marked off <VOCNOISE> in sections a section of land <VOCNOISE> is uh <VOCNOISE> six hundred and forty acres <VOCNOISE> and that sounds like a lot of <VOCNOISE> it is a good sized area <IVER>
but <LAUGH> when you can't grow much of anything on it it's <IVER>
not that valuable <VOCNOISE> but they <CUTOFF-th=thought> <SIL> that's what they thought though you <VOCNOISE> get it for free well you <VOCNOISE> and then you um <VOCNOISE> you prove up on it as they say you <VOCNOISE> you just <VOCNOISE> build buildings a house and barn and <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> so that you could <VOCNOISE> live on it <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i think i don't know i suppose <SIL> farm a certain amount of what i mean <VOCNOISE> put in wheat or whatever <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> and after five years you get a title to it it's yours <VOCNOISE> so they thought well gee yknow free country free land <VOCNOISE> to a farmer <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> they went out there but <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> dad said in <VOCNOISE> the eleven years that they were out there <VOCNOISE> they only raised <VOCNOISE> three or four crops <IVER>
i mean <VOCNOISE> it's just too dry it <CUTOFF-w=wasn't> <IVER>
it wasn't really farming country <VOCNOISE> and he went <VOCNOISE> he went out there from iowa <VOCNOISE> where you <VOCNOISE> throw a kernel of corn out in the field and <IVER>
a stalk of corn would grow <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> that's how i <VOCNOISE> see uh <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> the <VOCNOISE> only <VOCNOISE> regular crop they had when they were out there my parents <VOCNOISE> was kids <LAUGH> <IVER>
there were six of us born out there <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> my oldest sister <VOCNOISE> started to school out there <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether my <CUTOFF-s=second> uh i don't think <VOCNOISE> my second sister ever went to school out there <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> things were so tough that <VOCNOISE> and mom had <VOCNOISE> taught school in iowa <VOCNOISE> where she grew up <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> got her teacher's certificate <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i guess she and dad agreed that if they could <VOCNOISE> find someone to stay with <VOCNOISE> us kids through the day she could teach <IVER>
so she did <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether it was <VOCNOISE> more than a year or <VOCNOISE> not <VOCNOISE> for <VOCNOISE> i think it was forty dollars a month <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> course that was forty dollars <VOCNOISE> more than they had otherwise <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> then i think <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> let's see she <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> well she went out there when bernice was going to school <VOCNOISE> and bernice went to <VOCNOISE> my oldest sister went to <VOCNOISE> know whether it's first or maybe second grade out there <VOCNOISE> says she <VOCNOISE> she really thought that mom was the best teacher she ever <LAUGH-had_in_grade_school> <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-buzt=but> uh <VOCNOISE> then <VOCNOISE> they hired a girl to come in as a hired girl <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> about the second or third day <VOCNOISE> she was there <VOCNOISE> she wasn't <CUTOFF-feel=feeling> wasn't feeling very good <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> she had smallpox <IVER>
so uh <VOCNOISE> they got us kids <VOCNOISE> vaccinated in time but dad didn't i mean they <IVER>
didn't get vaccinated in time <VOCNOISE> and he was <VOCNOISE> just covered with <VOCNOISE> those sores for i don't know how long <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> mom said that <VOCNOISE> after they started <CUTOFF-cu=?> <VOCNOISE> after the scabs started falling off of him <VOCNOISE> why he'd get out the bed and <VOCNOISE> she'd take the sheet out in the yard and <VOCNOISE> shake it to get those scabs <LAUGH-off> <VOCNOISE> but uh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
the <VOCNOISE> the only uh <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> only people out there other than homesteaders were <VOCNOISE> sheepherders <IVER>
there was this <VOCNOISE> one guy <VOCNOISE> had a <VOCNOISE> so i don't know how many several herds of sheep <VOCNOISE> and he'd hire <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i think they were mexicans <IVER>
as sheepherders <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> they were <VOCNOISE> not <LAUGH-very> <VOCNOISE> desirable specimens other than for <ERROR-heating=herding> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=?> herding sheep <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> we'd come in <VOCNOISE> dirty when <VOCNOISE> mom was the uh <VOCNOISE> dirty as an old sheepherder <LAUGH> <IVER>
and then <VOCNOISE> back of our house <VOCNOISE> about <VOCNOISE> i don't know five hundred yards <VOCNOISE> there's a manmade <VOCNOISE> lake <IVER>
or a small one <VOCNOISE> and i don't know <VOCNOISE> whether it was there when we moved there or not <VOCNOISE> but anyway it was <VOCNOISE> fairly good size i mean <VOCNOISE> probably half mile a mile long and <VOCNOISE> and out in the middle of it <VOCNOISE> there was an island <IVER>
there'd been a small <VOCNOISE> raised place out there <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> what i remember about it is <VOCNOISE> one morning <VOCNOISE> dad went out to milk and <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> milk cows were out on the on that island <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so and <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether he had a boat or anyway there's a boat <ERROR-availiable=available> to him and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> he <CUTOFF-w=?> <VOCNOISE> rowed across the island <IVER>
to milk the cows <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> and then uh <VOCNOISE> one day <VOCNOISE> my two sisters older than i bernice and francis <VOCNOISE> and i were outside playing and <VOCNOISE> bernice i don't know whether bernice or me but one of us said well <CUTOFF-le=let's> <VOCNOISE> let's go down and wade in the lake <IVER>
and that was strictly no no <IVER>
well we started down there and <VOCNOISE> francis the goody two shoes said <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna tell mom <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and she did but we were out <IVER>
bernice had hiked up her <SIL> skirts and i'd rolled up my pants leg and <VOCNOISE> where i was probably not over knee deep <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> i think i was <VOCNOISE> good talking too was all we ever got out of it <IVER>

yes <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> right <SIL> um-hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i studied there i studied music and chemistry and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ended up with a <SIL> double major bachelors degree there <VOCNOISE> not doing really at the same time <IVER>
studying music for a while and then studying chemistry <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> no i <NOISE> i <CUTOFF-clipping=couldn't> i didn't think of any projects where i could use both <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> that's <SIL> interesting <SIL> thing <HES-I'm> <SIL> i'm not <SIL> in geology <LAUGH-right> <LAUGH-now> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm actually making more money right now in <SIL> music than i am in geology <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i'm making most my money in something that's irrelevant to <SIL> most my <VOCNOISE> that has nothing to do with any of <NOISE-studies> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> yes i <SIL> play <SIL> um principle horn in the <EXCLUDE-name> <HES-symphony> uh symphony orchestra <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> last year i was in a professional singing group <VOCNOISE> but i'm also in a number of volunteer <SIL> choirs <SIL> um <SIL> the <SIL> choir at the first unitarian universalist church <SIL> in <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> a small <SIL> choir where i work <SIL> which i got the opportunity to conduct today <SIL> <LAUGH-yes> the conductor <SIL> was <SIL> the conductor was <SIL> um <SIL> not at work <SIL> so <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> <HES-I> do a lot of music my <SIL> spare time <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mostly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> unfortunately i didn't <SIL> get a <SIL> job in geology <SIL> and i <SIL> i don't have a <SIL> <SIL> full time job music <SIL> either <VOCNOISE> <SIL> either one of those would be nice but i <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE-actually> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i went back <SIL> i came back to ohio state <SIL> um <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> see <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-ninety> <SIL> <CUTOFF-f=four?> <SIL> <HES-three> <SIL> through ninety <EXT-five> <SIL> and got a <SIL> teaching certificate in <SIL> for secondary science <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i taught <SIL> <VOCNOISE> for a year <SIL> a <VOCNOISE> at a small school in lancaster <SIL> catholic <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> high school <SIL> down there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> left there <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> part of was my fault i <SIL> wasn't very good at discipline <SIL> in the classroom <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so that was probably one of the biggest problems i had <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but uh <SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE-no> no in fact the <NOISE> principal when she interviewed me <SIL> asked me that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i <NOISE-said> <NOISE> when we're raised <SIL> in the unitarian sunday school <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a <SIL> it's <SIL> almost an indoctrination in tolerance <SIL> <LAUGH-for_other_religions> <LAUGH> so you're better off with me then somebody that believes <NOISE-theirs> is the only one true religion <IVER>
<NOISE> yes <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but it was interesting um um <SIL> they did have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> assemblies <SIL> where <SIL> they had religious assemblies um religion wasn't a <SIL> all <SIL> uh <SIL> it <SIL> wasn't <SIL> all invasive in this school but <VOCNOISE> they did have assemblies and <SIL> uh <SIL> for religious holidays and that kind of thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> i remember <SIL> thinking <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <SIL> it's interesting <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <SIL> the <SIL> concept of <SIL> eating <VOCNOISE> <SIL> somebody's flesh blood <SIL> <LAUGH> it's almost <SIL> cult like <LAUGH> and i'm <NOISE-thinking> and i'm starting to think <SIL> well what really separates a <SIL> a religion from a cult <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> and <HES-now> i think it's just <HES-the <SIL> this social acceptance of it really almost <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <HES-people> <SIL> you know how many people are in it <SIL> <NOISE-probably> <SIL> <HES-I> what number <SIL> <NOISE> divides them i'm not really <LAUGH-sure> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> well i <HES-like> i like <SIL> um <SIL> i <SIL> <SIL> was <SIL> i've been very <SIL> politically active at various times my past <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> especially i guess in the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> late seventies and early eighties <SIL> i was <SIL> very active in um <VOCNOISE> alternative <EXT-energy> <SIL> fighting against nuclear power <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> been active in various times in animal rights <SIL> movements <SIL> and uh <SIL> political <SIL> campaigns <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> foreign policy kinds of debates <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that kind of <SIL> kind of <SIL> thing <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> one thing that i've noticed <HES-a a lot <SIL> is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> there are a lot of <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> there are well there <SIL> wide spectrum but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in the <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there a lot of liberals <NOISE> in the catholic church too <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <SIL> you know <HES-that> <IVER>

<NOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <HES-I've> <SIL> <HES-I> <SIL> play the french horn <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't think i said that before <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> i sing <SIL> tenor <SIL> and <SIL> mostly <SIL> choir stuff but <SIL> i've done a <SIL> few <SIL> small solo <SIL> things <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> uh hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-that's> what everybody when i tell <NOISE-people> i play <NOISE> that's what everybody says but <SIL> it seems to me that any instrument <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-can_be_hard> <LAUGH> depending i mean i can't see how anybody can <SIL> play a clarinet for example <LAUGH> but <SIL> there <NOISE> <SIL> some things that are hard about <SIL> playing the <SIL> french horn <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> one is that you can play <SIL> many different notes with a single <SIL> fingering <SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you just <SIL> it's <SIL> ear related <SIL> being able to <SIL> play is <SIL> related to how well <SIL> how well you can hear <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> how well you can project <SIL> what <SIL> what you want to hear into <SIL> how you form your mouth and <NOISE> what comes out <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
right right it's not an analytical process <SIL> it's analytical in the <VOCNOISE> sense of <VOCNOISE> controlling your mouth <NOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> your hand in the bell and that kind of thing <VOCNOISE> to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> get what you want to come out <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not <ERROR-analytic=analytical> analytical in terms of finger combinations no <LAUGH> not so much <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <SIL> it's bad <SIL> <LAUGH-it's_bad> <LAUGH> on the other hand it's not good to <SIL> let your mind wander off <LAUGH-somewhere> <LAUGH> <HES-I> <SIL> <HES-I find myself having to focus sometimes <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and to really <SIL> <NOISE> uh-hum <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah when i first went to oberlin i was a <SIL> performance major <SIL> in french horn <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and looking back on it i wish i'd <SIL> maybe <SIL> thought to <SIL> major in music education or at least have a little bit of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> background in that <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <HES-thinking> <VOCNOISE> it would have given me a little more <SIL> dimension in terms of my <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <SIL> teaching <SIL> possibilities <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> although i'm <SIL> certified to teach now in <SIL> chemistry and <SIL> uh earth science <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i could i could <SIL> it might take me <HES-a> <SIL> uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=?> a year or two <IVER>
just for the <SIL> courses that i need <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah it is it is <VOCNOISE> and there's nothing to guarantee that i wouldn't have the same result <LAUGH> which isn't to say that someday i won't get <SIL> back into teaching <SIL> but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i might <SIL> uh <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <NOISE> well it's harder than <SIL> i think in <VOCNOISE> some ways than people think <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i went to the teach ohio fair last year <SIL> to look around <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <HES-didn't <SIL> didn't see that much interest <HES-in> <SIL> in uh <SIL> chemistry or general science teachers <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think the market has <SIL> is fluctuated back to a point where they don't need as many <NOISE-right_now <NOISE> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they're not clamoring for us <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
uh <NOISE-hum> <NOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i just renewed my <HES-certification> certificate last year so i <LAUGH-may_get_back_into_it> <VOCNOISE> part of the reason i renewed my certificate was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year <SIL> and <SIL> that's kind of like a tutoring job where you can go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you can arrange <EXT-hours> <SIL> with a student <SIL> that <SIL> is at home for some reason <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i had one that <SIL> just had a baby <LAUGH> <NOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they <SIL> it's an interesting job because they look for somebody that <SIL> can cover <SIL> the most technical i guess subject that the student is taking <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in my case it <SIL> turned out to be <SIL> chemistry in one <SIL> i think <SIL> chemistry once and i <SIL> it was the <SIL> algebra <SIL> two <VOCNOISE> another <VOCNOISE-time> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they expected us to <SIL> at least expected me <VOCNOISE> uh to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them <VOCNOISE> so there was english and there was history <LAUGH> so really requires you to be well rounded <LAUGH> and i <SIL> i like kind of like <EXT-that> um <VOCNOISE> i've taught <SIL> in a couple of other places um <SIL> community <SIL> colleges <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the <EXCLUDE-name> college in newark <SIL> i taught a chemistry class there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> the <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> community college <SIL> which is <SIL> in hillsboro but i taught at their <EXCLUDE-name> branch <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i taught a <SIL> <HES-introduction> an introduction to ecology class <NOISE-there> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> an introduction <SIL> to <SIL> uh <SIL> introduction to the arts it was called <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and that was interesting it was <NOISE> <SIL> <UNKNOWN> those are <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> it's kind of an underclass of teachers they don't pay <NOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> you enough to do that <SIL> <NOISE> they <SIL> pay you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> per <SIL> <NOISE> student contact hour <VOCNOISE> and <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> in my chemistry class i was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> teaching i think <VOCNOISE> a total of five or six contact hours a week <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they were <SIL> paying something like <SIL> twenty one or <SIL> twenty <SIL> two dollars an hour <LAUGH> <NOISE-so> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah they don't pay you for any of that <LAUGH-stuff> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> no <SIL> no they didn't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um didn't pay for grading or <SIL> preparing your classes or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or researching <NOISE-anything> <LAUGH> so <SIL> right <UNKNOWN> but but still even though <SIL> it was real <VOCNOISE> <SIL> very much underpaid job i <SIL> i liked it <SIL> when i did it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to <SIL> develop my own curriculum for it <LAUGH> <LAUGH-right> they had a <SIL> when they told me i <SIL> i <SIL> they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that was about this thick and it was only about <SIL> <NOISE-painting> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and i looked at it i thought <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broader <LAUGH-than_that> so <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i ended up coming up with a class that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was an <SIL> only nine weeks too it was only nine classes um so was <NOISE> about a <SIL> two and a half or three hour class each week for nine weeks <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> i ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting <SIL> mostly <SIL> uh <SIL> visual art <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and for the second three weeks we talked about music <SIL> and the <SIL> uh <SIL> development of music <SIL> various aspects <VOCNOISE> and for the last three weeks we talked about <SIL> theater <VOCNOISE> actually for the <SIL> two of the last three weeks we talked about theater <SIL> and for the last week we talked about musical theater and opera <LAUGH> so <VOCNOISE> for a lot of these kids you know from <EXCLUDE-name> it was an introduction <SIL> to <SIL> uh <SIL> it was an introduction to <SIL> a lot of <NOISE-things> they may <SIL> might not have been exposed to <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
<NOISE> yeah i think <SIL> mostly they did <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i was kind of surprised <SIL> uh <SIL> which <SIL> class was this in i think this was in that introduction to the arts class <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i was kind of surprised <NOISE> that one of the students in <SIL> class <SIL> thought it was <SIL> very hard <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> i didn't think it was that hard at all but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she <SIL> wrote me some kind of nasty note <NOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at this school <VOCNOISE> <SIL> before that my class and i was giving her a b and she was her average was going to be ruined and she hoped i felt guilty about it <LAUGH> not really <LAUGH> not really <VOCNOISE> i mean i was grading on a pretty much of a <NOISE-curve> too i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i was trying really not to flunk anybody that was <SIL> that was <SIL> attempting to do the work <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i think i flunked one person that was really goofing off <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> and uh <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> but in terms of a curve i had as i had bs i had a few <NOISE-Cs> <LAUGH> <NOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> yep <VOCNOISE> oh well <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it might be <NOISE> <SIL> um-hum um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <NOISE> right <SIL> right <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to <CUTOFF-s=?> tell a teacher <VOCNOISE> i'm <NOISE-supposed> to get an a <SIL> what's wrong with you <LAUGH> what's wrong with you <VOCNOISE> 
<VOCNOISE> i mean to me you're supposed to earn your grade <LAUGH> <IVER>
<NOISE> it's always been my feeling and <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i try to be fair in the way i grade <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> you know it's i try to be as objective as i can <VOCNOISE> sometimes i <VOCNOISE> because i think it's important that people learn how to write <VOCNOISE> i would ask all my classes to write <SIL> an essay or <SIL> short <IVER>
short uh <SIL> essay for for a test <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> but the way that i would grade those would be <SIL> pretty <NOISE-scientific> i <NOISE-think> <VOCNOISE> you know i'd come up with a rubric and i <NOISE-would> say <VOCNOISE> you you need to have <SIL> you need to mention certain things <NOISE-and> i'll give certain <NOISE-points> <NOISE-for> your <NOISE-mentioning> <NOISE-certain> <VOCNOISE> things <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> i've i've never been a <SIL> <NOISE-I've> <NOISE-never> <VOCNOISE> been a teacher where whose had to assign or grade <NOISE-creative> writing <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-I'm_not_sure_I_would_know_how_to_do_that> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH-right> <LAUGH> <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> well <NOISE> when i was teaching <VOCNOISE> taking teacher <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-education> classes here <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and <NOISE-observing> <NOISE> classroom teachers <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> would always tell me <VOCNOISE> you <NOISE> need to give a grade for class <NOISE-participation> <IVER>
that was always too subjective for <NOISE-ME> <VOCNOISE> i <IVER>
i could not <SIL> see myself <VOCNOISE> doing that and <SIL> and you know <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> how am i going to tell who's <VOCNOISE> yknow trying to butter me up <NOISE> by <VOCNOISE> raising their hand and <VOCNOISE> and asking questions <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i uh yknow i could i just couldn't see doing <NOISE-that> and i was <VOCNOISE> i had enough to worry about and think about <SIL> when i was trying to teach in <LAUGH-class> <VOCNOISE> keep everything else straight <SIL> and also mark down if people are participating uh that was tough <VOCNOISE> i ended up not doing it <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
subjective right <IVER>
right <IVER>
bump <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i know i know well it's good to have that i think it would be good to have that leeway <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but i'm not sure i would trust myself because <VOCNOISE> there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have <NOISE-more> of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others <VOCNOISE> and i wanted to be fair <VOCNOISE> in terms of <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> not cutting down the ones <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> didn't like that much <LAUGH> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> i think teaching band might be fun because <VOCNOISE> i think you <VOCNOISE> only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> whether you <SIL> were <SIL> well behaved yeah and whether you're trying to play your instrument <LAUGH> i i don't think we ever got a's b's and c's <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> the competition <NOISE-aspect> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> you played saxophone in the band <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
do you have one now <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
oh that's good <SIL> that's good <IVER>
well i can tell you some community bands that could use you <LAUGH> yeah yeah <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the one <SIL> that's <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> god <IVER>
shawn's in yeah <VOCNOISE> uh huh <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> uh we don't have enough saxophones <VOCNOISE> sure we could use you <LAUGH> <IVER>
huh <VOCNOISE> oh well <IVER>
we're having like three concerts the next month <LAUGH> <IVER>
right right <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> i i like playing that band <VOCNOISE> mostly because <VOCNOISE> the director is <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> he's a his dad is teaches trumpet here at ohio state <VOCNOISE> and he is uh <VOCNOISE> he likes to challenge us <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and it's not so much in the summer in the summer <VOCNOISE> we end up playing marches and <VOCNOISE> stuff that <SIL> popular favorites <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right but during the rest of the year a lot of times <NOISE-we'll> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-play> <SIL> really <NOISE> really um <VOCNOISE> challenging and interesting band music <VOCNOISE> and you don't always get the opportunity to do that <VOCNOISE> in uh <VOCNOISE> musical groups <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator of <VOCNOISE> what they <VOCNOISE> expect the audience to want to hear <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> well <VOCNOISE> i play actually in two orchestras <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> symphony <VOCNOISE> and in the <EXCLUDE-name> orchestra <VOCNOISE> which is an all <SIL> amateur group <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> it's actually <VOCNOISE> there were <NOISE-times> uh when i was <VOCNOISE> i've been in that group for <SIL> maybe seven or eight years now <VOCNOISE> there have been times when i've been in <NOISE-that> group that have <VOCNOISE> i have <VOCNOISE> thought <SIL> it had a really wretched sound <LAUGH> because they don't have auditions they just take anybody that wants to play <VOCNOISE> and if you take a <VOCNOISE> string player that can't play in tune it can really wreck everything <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> but uh i think we've improved a lot uh we we gave a concert <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> a couple weeks ago <VOCNOISE> at a church in upper arlington <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i thought it went pretty well <VOCNOISE> one piece a little bit of mozart <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> some concertos <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> that was fun <LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> it depends <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> i'd like to do new stuff <VOCNOISE> but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> in the <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> symphony <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> unfortunately they tend to have budget problems <SIL> um <SIL> because a lot of the people in that group are paid <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> um-hum <NOISE> i get <NOISE> i get <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=?> paid it's kind of semi professional <SIL> <CUTOFF-ae_s=aspect> <SIL> aspect thing where you <VOCNOISE> get paid per service <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> let's see <VOCNOISE> so they have to uh balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for <VOCNOISE> with the amount of music that <SIL> they want to do <LAUGH> and uh <VOCNOISE> this last year we played a <SIL> movement of the shuman concert piece for four horns and orchestra <VOCNOISE> and i was a little bit <SIL> flabbergasted when i saw that on the schedule <VOCNOISE> at the beginning of the year because <NOISE> it's <SIL> really <NOISE-hard> to play <VOCNOISE> and i thought <VOCNOISE> is he expecting <SIL> us to play this the solos <VOCNOISE> or is he expecting to bring in somebody <LAUGH> <IVER>
well as it turned out he expected <SIL> us to play the solos <LAUGH> or <SIL> didn't play the whole piece we only played one movement of it <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> i thought it came out pretty well i have a <SIL> recording of it <VOCNOISE> for a while there i was worried that we didn't get a recording of it and i was <SIL> really upset <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> just one concert <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i know that's why you have to get it recorded <LAUGH> <SIL> <NOISE-it> <VOCNOISE> it would be nice to have more than one concert <SIL> but uh <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> they <SIL> they just <SIL> they're on a shoestring <VOCNOISE> they really are <VOCNOISE> they get most of their money i think by <NOISE> well <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-probably> if you count <SIL> in kind contribution <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> <CUTOFF-w_eh_s_t_er=Westerville> uh otterbein college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> uh <SIL> <SIL> salary the conductor <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> so that's a <SIL> huge an amount of <NOISE> money <VOCNOISE> they put into it <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> what we have to <VOCNOISE> give <NOISE-them> in return is <SIL> <NOISE> an opportunity for <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-people> to play <NOISE-in> <NOISE-orchestra> <VOCNOISE> so uh sometimes we have <CUTOFF-s_t_uw=students> <NOISE> college students play in the orchestra <VOCNOISE> especially string players because they <NOISE-don't> have a <VOCNOISE> college orchestra <VOCNOISE> uh but once in a while we'll get wind players play in it <SIL> also <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> sometimes <NOISE-it> leads to a little bit of friction <VOCNOISE> when <VOCNOISE> they get to play something you wanted to play <LAUGH> <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> most the time it's not it's not bad <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so there's there's that it's an <NOISE> opportunity for <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> musicians in the college to play in an orchestra <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> and what else do they get out of it <VOCNOISE> i don't know prestige a suppose <LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
they <IVER>
don't get <CUTOFF-f=federal> i don't think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council <VOCNOISE> and they <VOCNOISE> they raise money from the businesses <NOISE-in> the community <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-plus> <VOCNOISE> we charge for tickets <LAUGH> for people to come and see us <VOCNOISE> and sometimes it's <NOISE> sometimes we get a lot <VOCNOISE> sometimes we don't get so many <VOCNOISE> turns out the concerts we get the most <VOCNOISE> the biggest audience for <VOCNOISE> are the <VOCNOISE> christmas concerts where we have children's <NOISE-choir> <LAUGH> because <IVER>
yes yeah <LAUGH> <LAUGH-thats> right <VOCNOISE> you can't get a <NOISE-seat> there <LAUGH> 
so it's a good money maker <IVER>
uh <NOISE-that's> right well we they don't they don't they don't give them <NOISE> uh <NOISE> i don't know maybe they give each <EXT-one> one free ticket or something <LAUGH> <LAUGH-the_rest_of_them_have_to_pay> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> um-hum <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> but that those are those tend to be my least favorite concerts although <VOCNOISE> our conductor tries hard to <VOCNOISE> make it interesting for orchestra members <SIL> by bringing in some <NOISE> <SIL> music but it's <SIL> that's <SIL> interesting <NOISE> challenging or whatever for orchestra <VOCNOISE> he's um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFFeh-?> we're lucky to have him he's <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> who's a <VOCNOISE> associate conductor for the uh <VOCNOISE> columbus symphony <NOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> he's <VOCNOISE> he's very good <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i'm glad that we have him as a conductor <NOISE> i was in the orchestra when we <VOCNOISE> selected <VOCNOISE> him <VOCNOISE> we auditioned <NOISE> think five <VOCNOISE> four or five conductors over the course of the year we had <SIL> each one for a different concert <NOISE> and we <NOISE-ended> up picking him <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
they weren't all they <NOISE-weren't> all columbus <NOISE-people> some of them sort of <SIL> flew in <VOCNOISE> visited <LAUGH> for <NOISE> for the job <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-there> is a <NOISE-little> bit of prestige <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> was <VOCNOISE> won some competition a couple years ago about <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> upcoming <NOISE-conducters> <IVER>
in the <SIL> <NOISE-and> the u <NOISE-S> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> that's true <IVER>
<NOISE-that's> true <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
that's true <VOCNOISE> sometimes we <VOCNOISE> have trouble finding enough <VOCNOISE> violists <VOCNOISE> or something yknow an instrument like that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but they <VOCNOISE> they <SIL> usually get enough to play a concert <SIL> sometimes we <SIL> have to bring in <VOCNOISE> a couple of <VOCNOISE> instrumentalists <SIL> for the last few rehearsals <VOCNOISE> um-hum <NOISE> so we sort of have <VOCNOISE> stringers <NOISE> i guess you'd <LAUGH-call_them> <LAUGH> yeah <VOCNOISE> we've actually been on w o s u also <VOCNOISE> uh radio on music <NOISE> um <VOCNOISE> our <EXT-recording> last year yeah <VOCNOISE> of beethoven's ninth <VOCNOISE> got on music in mid-ohio <LAUGH> yeah <NOISE> we used the <NOISE-Otterbein> college choir <NOISE> <NOISE-um-hum> <IVER>
it is it <NOISE-is> <LAUGH> um-hum <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> um-hum <NOISE> there <NOISE> there there <NOISE-were> some <NOISE-fun> things <NOISE-in> <NOISE-that> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-yeah> <NOISE> ah <NOISE> <NOISE-Sydney> opera <NOISE-house> i have a picture <NOISE-of> that in my head <NOISE> with the big <NOISE-shells> the <NOISE-big> <NOISE> it's a neat <NOISE-place> <IVER>
<NOISE-bad> acoustics really <IVER>
shocking <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh my <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <LAUGH> well <VOCNOISE> speaking of acoustics <VOCNOISE> i i don't know <NOISE-if> i'm <UNKNOWN> you'll have to tell me if i'm going off the subject <LAUGH> or yknow if you need to ask me something else <SIL> <NOISE-okay> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> this is another interesting story <VOCNOISE> my <VOCNOISE> church <VOCNOISE> choir <VOCNOISE> is very important <NOISE-part> of the <NOISE-church> up there on <EXCLUDE-name> have you ever been to the church up there <NOISE> should <VOCNOISE> visit sometime although <VOCNOISE> you're only <NOISE-going> to be here for another month <VOCNOISE> summer is not necessarily the best time to visit <IVER>
<NOISE-yeah> <NOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> just to see the church <VOCNOISE> might be fun <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> about <VOCNOISE> how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build <VOCNOISE> a new <VOCNOISE> worship center building <VOCNOISE> and because we were really <SIL> too <SIL> too big <VOCNOISE> for the <NOISE> sanctuary that we had <IVER>
and um <VOCNOISE> so basically they decided to build a new building <VOCNOISE> adjacent to <VOCNOISE> the church <VOCNOISE> tacked on <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> they asked the choir <VOCNOISE> for input <IVER>
as to what the sanctuary should be <NOISE-like> <LAUGH> so <NOISE-we> had a tour <VOCNOISE> uh the choir took a tour our choir director <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> arranged it <VOCNOISE> to about six five or six churches in the columbus area <VOCNOISE> to <NOISE-sing> in them <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-and> <VOCNOISE> not <NOISE> for an audience but just to sing <NOISE> and to see which ones <NOISE-we> liked the <NOISE-acoustics> of <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> that was <NOISE> interesting we sang <VOCNOISE> in uh <VOCNOISE> we sang in <NOISE-central> <NOISE-Presbyterian> <NOISE-Church> downtown <VOCNOISE> which was <NOISE-where> this <VOCNOISE> my one of my orchestras plays a lot <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we didn't <LAUGH> maybe it had some feedback i think the <NOISE-new> <NOISE-building> <NOISE-is> acoustically very good <VOCNOISE> it's <NOISE-certainly> <VOCNOISE> much <NOISE-better> than <VOCNOISE> old <VOCNOISE> worship center because <VOCNOISE> i don't <NOISE> know if you've seen a picture or anything of the church <VOCNOISE> the old worship center <VOCNOISE> was designed by a modern architect to be a modern <VOCNOISE> quote unquote type building in nineteen <NOISE-sixty-two> <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> it's <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <NOISE-it's> <NOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> flat <NOISE> <NOISE-there's> a <NOISE-flat> <NOISE> <NOISE-roof> <VOCNOISE> with a <SIL> clear story <VOCNOISE> in the middle <NOISE> it has <NOISE-nothing> in <NOISE-just> <NOISE> it's just empty <NOISE-space> <VOCNOISE> over the <VOCNOISE> over the worship center <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-so> <NOISE> when you would sing in that as a choir you spread out along the front <VOCNOISE> if you were under the <VOCNOISE> high <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> place <SIL> your <NOISE-voice> <NOISE-would> go <UNKNOWN> <NOISE> all <NOISE-of> <NOISE-the> way to <NOISE-the> <NOISE-back> <VOCNOISE> but if you were <NOISE-under> this flat ceiling that's only about <VOCNOISE> seven or <VOCNOISE> that's only about nine or ten feet high <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <NOISE-it> was <NOISE-dead>o <NOISE> it was <NOISE-just> <NOISE-muffled> <LAUGH> and um <VOCNOISE> it was <NOISE-terrible> <NOISE-acoustically> <LAUGH> <NOISE-but> <NOISE> yknow we made do <NOISE-with> <NOISE-it> <VOCNOISE> for many years <VOCNOISE> and then um <NOISE> and then <NOISE> we had the <VOCNOISE> the <NOISE-chance> to get this input into this new <NOISE-building> and it's <VOCNOISE> it's uh <VOCNOISE> it's really beautiful it's a circular <VOCNOISE> almost circular big <VOCNOISE> uh <NOISE> space with a <NOISE> <NOISE-high> point in the <NOISE-middle> of the roof <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> it's it's <NOISE-nice> <LAUGH> <NOISE-well> you could still go it's they won't have they won't <NOISE-have> a lot of um <IVER>
music <NOISE> during the summer but they'll have <VOCNOISE> regular worship service <NOISE> i think they're at ten <NOISE-thirty> <NOISE-now> <VOCNOISE> on <NOISE-Sunday> <NOISE-mornings> <VOCNOISE> i <NOISE-had> lot of times skip <NOISE-most> <VOCNOISE> during the summer <LAUGH> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <NOISE> um-hum <NOISE> um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> but how old is your <NOISE-kid> <IVER>
you could <VOCNOISE> but you could take her to <IVER>
oh okay <VOCNOISE> well the reason i asked was a lot it <NOISE-seems> to me a lot of <NOISE-the> impetus for going to <NOISE-church> or going back to church for people <VOCNOISE> is when their kid gets old enough to <VOCNOISE> go to sunday school <LAUGH> starting <NOISE-asking> questions about religion and you're saying <VOCNOISE> well i suppose i could answer all of these but <LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
you go to <LAUGH-right> <LAUGH-right> <VOCNOISE> right <NOISE> <NOISE-well> i started going to <CUTOFF-ch_ah=church> sunday school when i was <VOCNOISE> five or six years old <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <NOISE-um-hum> <NOISE> i i was raised in the sunday school of this church up here <VOCNOISE> yeah <NOISE> yes um a long time member <VOCNOISE> in fact <VOCNOISE> i think i may be <VOCNOISE> about the longest term member of the <NOISE-choir> <VOCNOISE> right now yeah <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-because> i sang in the <NOISE-choir> there when i was in high school <VOCNOISE> back in nineteen seventy <LAUGH> <LAUGH-so) <VOCNOISE> that's thirty years ago <LAUGH> yeah <VOCNOISE> yep <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-um-hum> <NOISE> right <VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-it's> it <NOISE-may> <NOISE-me> getting a little <NOISE-bit> more common nowadays but <VOCNOISE> it's still i <NOISE-think> <NOISE> the church gets most of its members from <NOISE> as converts <LAUGH> <NOISE-and> <VOCNOISE> recovering right <VOCNOISE> recovering you name it <LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-um-hum> <VOCNOISE> wow <VOCNOISE> uh huh <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> well i have <VOCNOISE> i have two <NOISE-uncles> that are southern baptist ministers <LAUGH> and it used to be when we would visit them <VOCNOISE> in the mid sixties <VOCNOISE> we would <VOCNOISE> have to go i mean if you visit your <VOCNOISE> relative if your relatives <NOISE-visit> <NOISE-and> you're <NOISE-minister> minister <VOCNOISE> you <NOISE-have> <NOISE-to> go to <NOISE-church> <LAUGH> and uh <VOCNOISE> but the thing is is southern baptist <VOCNOISE> um <NOISE> service always <NOISE> has that period <VOCNOISE> where you're <VOCNOISE>

um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> not really a big fan uh <SIL> i think one of the big problems is gonna be uh <SIL> uh initially just the uh <SIL> uh the monetary thing of it yknow the people that supported the uh <VOCNOISE> basically supported the uh <SIL> uh minor league teams that they had here yknow uh were like blue collar people and that <SIL> you go for twenty thirty bucks and <SIL> have a good time get drunk throw beer and <SIL> and up there yknow you're not gonna be able to do that it's gonna cost you uh <SIL> a minimum of fifty to a hundred dollars probably take a family there <SIL> couple of kids or something like that yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well the minor league hockey team the columbus chill are never there <SIL> um-hum <SIL> they don't have it now but uh because the blue jackets came in but <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i think it'd be good if it goes but <SIL> i'm just not sure that <SIL> columbus is gonna support something like that <SIL> and it's basically ohio state yknow <SIL> and they don't even support the uh <SIL> hockey team we got <ERROR-fra=for> ohio state yknow <SIL> and yet they're good <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well the uh wolff family and uh <SIL> the mcconnells have been around forever yknow <SIL> uh worthington industries and <SIL> and the wolff family's columbus dispatch uh <SIL> uh then you got uh i think it's rozutti <SIL> uh he's like a <SIL> was a construction guy so uh <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> they've been around forever and everything and uh <SIL> they <SIL> can get their ways through uh <SIL> political arenas and everything <CUTOFF-e=else> but i think most the money was uh <SIL> was private money <SIL> but they were given like tax incentives and <UNKNOWN-stuff?> things of that nature <IVER>
the old <CUTOFF-Pen=penitentiary> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah it's an <CUTOFF-o=old> it was an old eyesore that they should have got rid of years ago but <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well i think they tried to get some kind of a deal with uh <SIL> when they were planning this thing and with uh <SIL> with ohio state to <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow like have the schottenstein center down at uh <SIL> down closer to downtown or <SIL> or something like that <SIL> and play half your ball games there or something like that but <SIL> but ohio state don't need that yknow they got their own stuff <SIL> so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well that basically is <CUTOFF-ev=every> yknow as your <SIL> influx of <SIL> people move outer <SIL> city limits and everything yknow then uh <SIL> yknow you got to have places for them to shop and everything and <SIL> basically the northland mall's been there forever jacob who owned indians <SIL> owned it <SIL> uh <SIL> and he never did anything to it yknow so <VOCNOISE> you got <CUTOFF-y=your> over at your lazarus or penney's and <SIL> uh <SIL> mainstay <SIL> places that <SIL> generally move there because of the uh <SIL> years ago because it was <SIL> something well it was right there with <CUTOFF-wi with a lot of people population and everything <SIL> and then <CUTOFF-li=like> <SIL> like i say if you yknow you got <SIL> basically the people moving <SIL> out <SIL> to get away from the <SIL> the traffic and all that stuff yknow <SIL> not that they're moving away from it they're still getting into it but <SIL> uh the district perspective on it <SIL> uh <SIL> then you <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-hafta=have <CUTOFF-b=build> if you build it they will come they say yknow so <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> and i guess he's still gonna build it so <IVER>
uh-uh <IVER>
as it was jacob's sold the northland mall anyway so it's probably gonna be <SIL> like a <SIL> <CUTOFF-sh=shopping <SIL> a strip mall more or less <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> which is good for me because i don't ever go there anyway so <IVER>
and i'm one of those go in get what you want and get the heck out yknow and <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> i remember when i was married my my ex said do you want go uh <SIL> shopping <SIL> what <IVER>
just get me a couple shirts or something yknow she always bought my clothes anyway so <SIL> so just get me a couple <CUTOFF-sh=shirts> get me whatever you think i need yknow <SIL> i'll be here <SIL> drinking beer watching <SIL> sports <SIL> yknow <IVER>
it's uh <IVER>
i live at um one sixty one and cleveland area <SIL> in an apartment up there <IVER>
it ain't that far it's uh <IVER>
if you got a car it's easy to get there <SIL> yeah but <SIL> if you if you're <SIL> ride the bus it's sometimes uh <SIL> takes a couple hours so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> i'd like to seen it pass just for the fact to see what the hell they would have done with the money but <SIL> uh <SIL> i don't blame people for voting for the one and not vote for the other <SIL> because you're talking about something twenty years <VOCNOISE> i had a engineering <SIL> a civil engineering friend years ago and uh <SIL> i was a <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-wo=worked> worked at ashland chemical which is over in dublin and i lived over where i'm living now <SIL> and every <SIL> year they were doing work on two seventy yknow <SIL> so i get pissed off and uh bitch <SIL> be bitching at him about it and everything yknow and he'd go <SIL> you don't realize yknow by time we get something approved <SIL> through all the <SIL> parameters you've got to go through and everything <SIL> and then they start working on it and then they get it done <SIL> it's already ten fifteen years old <IVER>
guess i never thought about it <SIL> like that <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <CUTOFF-g=goodale?> that's <SIL> i'm surprised they're not getting a lot of heat from that but <SIL> because that park's been there forever yknow <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <SIL> plus they have that uh <SIL> which they've had for like twenty some years a comfest or something <SIL> uh which is <SIL> big thing down there yknow <SIL> uh <SIL> local musicians and <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah but the ones that they really needed to do <SIL> like two <CUTOFF-sev=seventy> well like seventy one and seventy i mean that <SIL> i don't <SIL> it's a bottle neck area yknow <SIL> and they really should have done something with that <SIL> twenty years ago yknow <IVER>
um that's probably when they started yeah <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i used to when i was driving now uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-plu=plus> <SIL> especially when i was going through the uh <VOCNOISE> going to two seventy things yknow i had people flip me off and stuff like that and <VOCNOISE> i had a funny thing one time a guy flipped me off because he was going slow <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> i got all <SIL> pissed off about him and went around him and everything yknow and <SIL> i go to <CUTOFF-a=ashland> <SIL> work <SIL> pull in at ashland chemical and who pulls in beside me but him <SIL> i look over at him he looks at me like <SIL> oh <SIL> yknow i'm sorry i mean yknow i was <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no we just <SIL> both happen to work there <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
it's over off of uh <SIL> thirty three <SIL> two seventy and thirty three 
<ERROR-tutter_maw=tuttle_mall> tuttle mall around tuttle mall thirteen years uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh <IVER>
uh <SIL> i was going through a divorce parents <SIL> both parents passed away uh <SIL> my ex moved to saint louis didn't <SIL> tell me anything about it or foreclosing on the house and that's how i found out she moved and <SIL> just a bunch of <SIL> shit and <SIL> i just started uh <SIL> screwing up <SIL> so they wanted to <SIL> put me on probation and my uh <SIL> rebellious attitude or whatever said <SIL> i quit <SIL> was pretty stupid really but <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yknow what happened like in the same <SIL> year eighty eight <SIL> yknow so <SIL> but it was <SIL> it was <SIL> pretty tough but i just didn't deal with it properly yknow <SIL> i should've went and got counseling and by the way i probably should've got <SIL> marriage counseling but i refused to do that too so <SIL> but i didn't think i had a problem i thought she was the one with one <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
but she's doing fine <SIL> um <SIL> she was dating somebody i don't know whether they really got married or not yknow because i don't really have that much communication with her but <SIL> some guy younger than her and <SIL> i talked to him he seemed like pretty decent guy <SIL> yeah <IVER>
well it was rough <IVER>
not the actually going through it yknow <SIL> to me <SIL> it was to her <SIL> but the aftermath basically yknow you <ERROR-gis=just> <IVER>
at each other's throat for this that and the other and <SIL> and <SIL> yknow devon is uh my daughter's the one that really got <SIL> put in the middle of it yknow and <VOCNOISE> probably it was a blessing that they moved to saint louis because there probably could've been more uh <SIL> problems <SIL> legal problems yknow as far as uh <SIL> going back and forth to court and <SIL> putting her on the witness stand for stupid stuff yknow and <SIL> so <SIL> uh <SIL> in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there <IVER>
no i've never i've i used to uh <SIL> have an office out there that i visited all the time but uh <SIL> i've never been out there to <SIL> she actually lives in kirkwood <SIL> which is a suburb <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
so uh <SIL> that's where she went to high school and everything uh <SIL> but i had no i've never went out there <SIL> uh my my ex still has family here so <SIL> she comes back a couple three times a year and <SIL> i generally try to hook up with her <SIL> and <SIL> it's been a while but as she got older yknow she wants to be with <SIL> with her uh <SIL> playmates and everything as they get older yknow so <SIL> and <SIL> having went through that myself i understand that so <SIL> no it got kind of rough to have her here for a couple <SIL> three weeks out of a <SIL> or a month or something like that yknow during the summer <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
or they don't really give a damn that's the thing that uh <SIL> i've got i've got some friends that <SIL> with kids and <SIL> i see it like on the bus or with uh yknow when you're working somewhere and uh where you <SIL> people treat there kids yknow as a <IVER>
i mean i didn't have the greatest childhood i don't think any of us ever really had the best yknow but <SIL> but i don't <SIL> like i wouldn't <SIL> talk to my kid the way <SIL> some of these people talk to them <SIL> but um <SIL> one today yknow and she got on the bus and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the little girl went and set over here she's probably about <SIL> eight <UNKNOWN> <SIL> maybe six or something like that and she wanted to set here her mommy so she made her set with her which is cool <SIL> and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kid's trying to study her homework yknow for <SIL> not that well <SIL> i don't know was she up all night partying or was she up all night working yknow or <SIL> what the hell's is your problem <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> but the little girl's setting there going <SIL> mommy you need to go <VOCNOISE> help with seven like seven nine times nine's sixty three yknow and <SIL> her time tables and stuff yknow and <SIL> so uh <SIL> yeah i see <SIL> like younger kids to <SIL> with kids yknow and <SIL> and think yknow man your just <SIL> not only have you wasted <CUTOFF-y=you?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> <CUTOFF-s=screwed> <SIL> you screwed up your life you're gonna <SIL> you also screwed up your kids yknow <SIL> i was twenty <SIL> well i was thirty one when devon was born so <SIL> my ex was twenty eight <SIL> so we were <UNKNOWN> <SIL> both older <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not that that really helped as far as <IVER>
but i think it gave her <CUTOFF-so=some?> <SIL> and i wouldn't say i never got mad uh but <SIL> i've gotten mad at devon quite a few times yknow because i didn't like to <SIL> some of the things that uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she would either say or <SIL> or that she would do or <SIL> uh <SIL> but <SIL> yknow <SIL> i try to let her <SIL> live her life yknow <SIL> i think there's love <SIL> nobody can <SIL> teach anything unless you learn it <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah she went to school here till uh <SIL> ninety one actually <SIL> uh <SIL> so she was <SIL> let's see <SIL> about the fourth grade <SIL> fifth grade something like that <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> mm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think it could've <CUTOFF-b=been> i thought she'd get a better education out there <SIL> uh <SIL> now at saint louis school public school district she probably <SIL> district she probably would've <CUTOFF-g=got> had the same as here <VOCNOISE> but by being kirkwood yknow and <SIL> relatively small and everything <SIL> um <SIL> i think we maybe had uh <SIL> a hundred and <SIL> some kids in our graduating class yknow so <SIL> uh i felt i got better <SIL> attention when i wanted it <SIL> yknow <SIL> uh <SIL> then i would've at a <SIL> at a bigger school <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
yeah much too fast for me yknow <SIL> my <IVER>
i know the way we yknow the way we dressed and everything yknow it was kind of appalling to <SIL> to the parents and everything i guess maybe that's where <SIL> i'm coming from i mean uh <SIL> the way some of the uh <SIL> kids dress <SIL> yknow retro back to when with the bell bottoms and everything to us <SIL> and the uh <SIL> the piercings i just can't get into that yknow and <SIL> then some of the girls i mean they yknow <SIL> i mean my god they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at <SIL> fourteen six fifteen years old they look like they're twenty some years old yknow and that's what they want to look like <SIL> plus you watch some of these stupid shows on tv yknow <SIL> you <SIL> sit there and go <SIL> man i couldn't <CUTOFF-b=believe?> <CUTOFF-ma=my> my daughter don't do that yknow it's <SIL> when she's around me <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> never <SIL> when she's away from me i don't know what the hell she does <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
well i think uh <SIL> in my opinion i think <CUTOFF-main=mainly> mainly the uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it's> its the absence <SIL> of uh <SIL> basically <SIL> parenting yknow <SIL> uh <SIL> my mom was there <SIL> um <SIL> she was a housewife yknow <SIL> and uh <SIL> so she was she went to work after <CUTOFF-w=we> <SIL> i think when i was a <SIL> junior in high school yknow <SIL> and my brother they all my brothers and sisters are graduated yknow so <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> and that hurt her to go she <UNKNOWN-dx_ih_?=didn't?> thought she was letting <SIL> yknow neglecting me i was in <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
thought about it i've <VOCNOISE> come home get in the car and go out go somewhere yknow or come home get something to eat and <SIL> yeah that was about it i <SIL> ah but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think that has a lot to do with it um <SIL> i don't really <CUTOFF-n=know> <SIL> know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid and watching <SIL> howdy doody and all that stuff and <SIL> course it wasn't the uh <SIL> violent stuff maybe that you can see on tv now or uh but <SIL> i don't really think the media just hasn't had that much to do with it <SIL> it's just a different time now uh <SIL> i mean i remember <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast yknow with uh <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-y=yknow> <SIL> the vietnamese guy uh <SIL> vietcong guy getting <SIL> his brains blowed out on national tv yknow and uh <SIL> uh <SIL> that didn't make me go out and <VOCNOISE> um want to do that yknow <SIL> so <SIL> if anything it made me want not want to do it yknow because <SIL> my brother was in was in vietnam <SIL> he was in the army <SIL> and uh when i got my notice he's like three years older than me yknow and he's <SIL> so i mean it don't <SIL> they'll draft you they'll put you on the front line <SIL> i said well i'm going to <SIL> enlist in the airforce anyway <SIL> so 
<SIL> as long as you uh <SIL> see and i'd already i already <CUTOFF-s=suspected?> <SIL> knew i was gonna be getting a notice so <SIL> because i flunked out like in december <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> and uh <SIL> so in january i had already contacted the navy and the airforce <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> about getting into their taking their tests and everything taking their uh <SIL> physicals <SIL> uh <SIL> so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well then they had uh after that they had the lottery number and that wasn't <SIL> if you were hot yknow if you got <SIL> your number was picked i mean <SIL> i don't know which would be worse knowing that you're gonna get <SIL> a notice and <SIL> being able to prepare for it or <VOCNOISE> uh because i've had friends that got <CUTOFF-nu=numbers> uh numbers and everything yknow and and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my god <SIL> so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i was reading a thing though in uh <VOCNOISE> the u s a i think it was yesterday where uh <SIL> your uh <SIL> minority and your your uh <VOCNOISE> uh majority yknow uh <SIL> it's always been that well yknow they were <SIL> trying to make it seem like it's <SIL> different it's always but like yknow <SIL> like the army has always been forty percent <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh minority and <SIL> sixty percent or something like that yknow that uh <SIL> airforce has always been <SIL> uh <SIL> like <SIL> seventy thirty or something like that yknow because the standards are a little bit higher to get in and a lot of people don't want to get into that yknow they don't want to take them tests and everything yknow <SIL> uh my <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> a cousin that <VOCNOISE> was a uh <SIL> spent <SIL> twenty five years i think in the army because that's <SIL> he could've done better but that's all he wanted to <NOISE-do> <UNKNOWN> yknow <SIL> be a drill sergeant and stuff like that yknow <SIL> but uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> i just think a lot <CUTOFF-o=of> lot of times the media <IVER>
uh <SIL> and research and stuff like that to do a lot of things that were <SIL> done <SIL> years ago <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
they always been there i mean yknow and uh i don't really care what the uh <SIL> guys <SIL> specific thing is if he's in a fox hole with me yknow and <SIL> as long as he can shoot a <LAUGH-gun_I> <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean <VOCNOISE> i could care <CUTOFF-le=less> i've got gay friends yknow so <IVER>
<SIL> i think it's better probably at the <VOCNOISE> don't let them say anything about it yknow <SIL> and most of the people will <SIL> yknow like when you get to a <SIL> i lived in the barracks a lot of time but i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> lot of people yknow they get their own places off base yknow and <SIL> who cares what they are i mean i don't care <SIL> yknow <SIL> like say i have <CUTOFF-f=friends?> gay friends that <SIL> yknow and <SIL> i don't care what they do i mean if <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH-they're> old enough to do whatever the heck <SIL> they want to do yknow <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah i <VOCNOISE> well i think basically that goes back to uh <SIL> yknow the parenting and everything yknow there was something <SIL> missing in the uh <SIL> uh the child's life yknow uh <SIL> uh i bet he wasn't getting perhaps <SIL> attention <SIL> uh those <SIL> kids in particular i don't <SIL> understand how they could be building bombs in <SIL> in their basement and mom and dad not know what was going on yknow i mean <SIL> uh it's just tragedy <SIL> i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh <SIL> uh <SIL> we were like <SIL> i don't know uh <SIL> eleven years old or something like that well an accidental shooting him in <SIL> him and the <SIL> uh another friend of mine from the same <VOCNOISE> same class yknow <SIL> um <SIL> he pulled a gun and shot him yknow and didn't know that the damn thing was loaded but <SIL> and they were talking about another thing about that yknow where some <SIL> kid i guess that happened just here in town uh <SIL> couple about a week ago or something like that yknow where a guy <SIL> shot another guy but <SIL> i mean <SIL> those things are just <SIL> senseless crimes really yknow <SIL> and who's really to fault and who's really at <CUTOFF-g=guilty> <SIL> who's guilty i don't know <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i'd like to have uh <SIL> not that they'd ever would have but if if <SIL> one of the two that you that <CUTOFF-c=columbine> <ERROR-culombine=columbine> yknow if they would have survived i'd like to seen what was going through their heads yknow <SIL> but that's something we'll never know <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> but that's kind of it <SIL> it <UNKNOWN> <SIL> yknow kind of came through where they were like uh <SIL> when i was growing up we had the uh <SIL> the <SIL> yknow you had your jocks and everything of course and you had your uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-w=we?> <CUTOFF-c=called?> we were called deads yknow <SIL> uh <SIL> and i was kind of like in the middle yknow of it <SIL> i played a little bit of sport yknow but i also associated with them and they were basically potheads yknow and everything so <SIL> uh <SIL> so like i say i <CUTOFF-b=but?> <SIL> yknow <UNKNOWN> i was kind of uh associated with both of them but then the football players yknow <UNKNOWN> <SIL> some of them were uh <SIL> pretty uh <SIL> pretty much asses yknow <SIL> no other way to put it especially if they were <SIL> got scholarships and stuff yknow they were <SIL> mean they could be real <SIL> uh <SIL> nasty <VOCNOISE> but uh <NOISE> <SIL> i just can't <CUTOFF-s=see?> i don't know i just think maybe <UNKNOWN-if> i don't know looking at it back is like uh well i've got into arguments with a few of them and then seen them later on yknow and <SIL> it's like <SIL> hey man yknow <SIL> let me buy you beer yknow or whatever yknow <UNKNOWN> sorry about what happened we were <SIL> yknow <SIL> shoot it happened five years ago yknow i don't <VOCNOISE> i try to forget things that <SIL> yknow i mean <SIL> my mind <VOCNOISE> got enough to absorb yknow without <SIL> worrying about uh which i do worry quite a bit about things but <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> about stupid stuff uh <SIL> like that kind of yknow somebody gets mad at you because you were a <SIL> your a not a jock or yknow you're you're a you're a <SIL> you're a this or you're a that yknow everybody trying to label people and stuff <IVER>
yeah and <CUTOFF-a=and> and everybody's gonna associate with people that they feel comfortable with <SIL> so <SIL> yknow <SIL> and unfortunately as that guy this guy in particular he was a center for the football team as he grew up <SIL> older yknow uh <SIL> he realized that he wasn't as big as important as he uh <SIL> and he blew out his knee for a <SIL> o u yknow <SIL> i went to <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-s=school> i went to school with larry hunter who's the a <SIL> basketball coach for uh <SIL> o u <SIL> now <SIL> and uh <SIL> and he had the same thing happen to him uh he had uh scholarship for o u and <VOCNOISE> both of his knees are shot and everything but uh <SIL> and he was a good ballplayer probably one best ones i ever seen and <SIL> uh <SIL> rivalled like a larry byrd yknow back in that day and everything and uh <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> one heck of a nice guy yknow <SIL> never let it get to him <IVER>
never thought he was any better than anybody else yknow he was always there to <SIL> to help out every kid yknow <SIL> but then some people like you say yknow some people aren't that way <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> they had one i was uh just <SIL> heard on news this morning they were talking about some guy who's like seventy seven years old for <VOCNOISE> kenyon college or something the <SIL> was throwing erasers at <CUTOFF-ever=everybody> <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> but i could <SIL> i could imagine <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah but yknow the <CUTOFF-th=the> if you hit somebody in the eye obviously it's gonna hurt him but yknow most <IVER>
could see it they <SIL> they could be ducking i mean yknow you <SIL> seventy seven years old i can't imagine being hurt by him yknow <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
uh-uh <VOCNOISE> uh-uh 
<SIL> i've <SIL> i <SIL> at <CUTOFF-ti=time> at one time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but <SIL> course that would have been i'm forty nine so that would have been probably what about <SIL> twenty <SIL> four <SIL> so <SIL> would have about twenty five years in so <VOCNOISE> i'd be right at and ready to get the heck out anyway yknow <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> plus you get so many different <SIL> students and <VOCNOISE> what i like <SIL> just walking over here today yknow it's <VOCNOISE> kind of thought yknow <UNKNOWN-that_uh> <VOCNOISE> i wonder how many of these people i walk by yknow are gonna be here in <SIL> january <SIL> because yknow a lot of because i did yknow i thought well this is cool man yknow <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
yeah <SIL> should been in class <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well and and and especially in my situation yknow at the <VOCNOISE> i think about it quite a bit yknow if i would've had a <UNKNOWN-bachelor's> <SIL> more of an opportunity to have a one on one <SIL> uh <SIL> relationship with her i'd probably uh <SIL> uh being a girl <SIL> yknow could of probably helped her out in the <SIL> in a lot of <CUTOFF-socio=social> <SIL> social things social things yknow about <SIL> man because i <VOCNOISE> i kind of get the impression that she don't really that she still ain't very interested in <SIL> men yknow so <SIL> much as <SIL> it's her thing yknow <SIL> so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so um <SIL> but yknow i <UNKNOWN> uh <SIL> yeah i think yknow a lot of times you think well yknow um <SIL> when you don't even know you sit there say i'm only a phone call away yknow <SIL> and all you do is call me but <SIL> it's not the same thing as <SIL> being there and <SIL> and she's <SIL> well i remember one time when she was having a stomach ache she was like <SIL> uh like twelve or thirteen years old yknow and <SIL> and i said well what's the matter she goes uh <VOCNOISE> my stomach hurts i said uh <SIL> well are you on you on your period or what yknow and she goes <VOCNOISE> dad <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

that's the appalachia area yeah <SIL> um-hum <SIL> it'd be great if somebody yknow they gonna want to pump all this money into it but unfortunately whenever the government pumps money into an area yknow <SIL> that <SIL> tends to be like a uh <SIL> foreign country gets it yknow and <SIL> <IVER>

um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>

um-hum <SIL> inspiration motivation i useta have a business when i had first <SIL> quit ashland i had a motivational tape business and everything but uh <SIL> uh <SIL> i tended to <SIL> let that go downhill <SIL> do the <SIL> cocaine and <LAUGH> <SIL> other things yeah <IVER>

um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> yeah i can <SIL> i'm <SIL> two thirty five <IVER>

<LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
thirty nine <IVER>
uh north end <SIL> over by riverside hospital <IVER>
henderson olentangy <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um currently unemployed <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah i'm looking for work um taking my time looking for work <VOCNOISE> it's the first chance that i've had in probably twenty years to sit back and get what i want <NOISE> so i'm doing that <SIL> <NOISE_I'm> <VOCNOISE> getting unemployment and taking my time i've got <SIL> several interviews so <VOCNOISE> some exciting ones so <IVER>
um secretarial <SIL> administrative assistant <SIL> type work <IVER>
uh i'm kind of happy i'm not doing that anymore it really takes a certain <ERROR-kype=type> type of person to work for in that's hard to find <VOCNOISE> in that area so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=in> uh in insurance off and on working for independent insurance agents <VOCNOISE> so i did that until i <SIL> uh came to a company that i stayed with for seven years <VOCNOISE> and then they relocated to dallas <SIL> so yeah <IVER>
um <IVER>
i didn't wanna go to dallas <IVER>
so there was a couple people that went but probably two out of five hundred <VOCNOISE> and nobody wanted to <LAUGH-mo=move> <SIL> so i stayed here <IVER>
oh probably my family <SIL> my kids are here <SIL> i have a grandchild now so <VOCNOISE> yeah i like to stay <SIL> close to all them <IVER>
she is four months <VOCNOISE> almost five <IVER>
yeah <SIL> so i'm a new grandma <NOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> thanks <LAUGH> i don't feel like a grandma either so <VOCNOISE> have to be careful what i do they still watch me i guess <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh-oh <NOISE> <IVER>
oh <SIL> that's fun and that's a challenging age too thirteen months that's fun <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> <IVER>
um <SIL> no <SIL> i got to babysit for like a week and then she has a best friend that's watching her baby and <VOCNOISE> a friend of hers that has other kids too so it's real good for the baby <NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah it's my daughter <SIL> yeah <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
uh she's actually at uh columbus state <VOCNOISE> she's gonna study to be a teacher <IVER>
so she's doing that and uh <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> she's nineteen <NOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh gosh a whole lot more people <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> whole lot more places to live seems like everywhere i turn there's construction and and <VOCNOISE> yknow you go down one one road and then you wait a couple years if you don't go in that area and <SIL> it's all changed <SIL> looks all different <VOCNOISE> so and that's mainly like looking at bethel <SIL> and <SIL> three fifteen north things like that <IVER>
yeah <SIL> think the population <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> in a way <SIL> but i think it also <SIL> leaves it open for all the things of <SIL> having too many people in one area <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i don't i don't know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i've been home <SIL> i've been reading the paper a lot more and <VOCNOISE> yknow i'm more aware of what's going on and <VOCNOISE> i really um gonna be some kind of activist <SIL> for <LAUGH> um <VOCNOISE> i don't know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman's clubs and things like that i just i think that's gonna be really bad <SIL> for the kids and and everybody around <VOCNOISE> um there's one off of uh bethel <SIL> or no it's off of henderson cahoots <SIL> and then there's the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and <VOCNOISE> i couldn't even believe they're like right across the street from each other <VOCNOISE> yknow and <SIL> it's funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they <SIL> let all that stuff so <SIL> thinking it really affects it <NOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> try to go around <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> and until they make a women's uh club <LAUGH-so> <VOCNOISE> won't be real <LAUGH-equal> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
uh um <VOCNOISE> i'm sure that it has because it enables a lot more people to get housing and <SIL> and things like that <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and i and yknow growth is always good my husband's in construction so i shouldn't be against it or anything but <VOCNOISE> um you kind of like to have things spread out and kind of yknow <SIL> have some space <SIL> so <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i work downtown <VOCNOISE> the last year i worked downtown and then i think about <SIL> oh probably fifteen twenty years ago i worked downtown <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> yknow as far as the focus you mean like nighttime things or just anything in general or <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it's smaller compared to most downtowns <VOCNOISE> i mean you <SIL> yknow it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and you're out <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-so> <VOCNOISE> i don't think it that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable <VOCNOISE> that would be nice <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh i live up north <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> around carl and <SIL> uh morse road <IVER>
<NOISE> so i have a house <IVER>
oh <NOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <CUTOFF-n=no?> <LAUGH-oh> then you wouldn't be too familiar with everything huh <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
northland mall <IVER>
yeah <SIL> with all the controversy about that and polaris and <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i don't know <CUTOFF-i=it's> it's <SIL> northland is such a <VOCNOISE> a good location for all the people around there and it's certainly not <SIL> yknow um <SIL> um <SIL> a hurting <CUTOFF-nei=neighborhood> or yknow a neighborhood that <VOCNOISE> people don't need <SIL> the shopping so i didn't see the difference of having both <SIL> there's lazarus everywhere there's sears everywhere why not have it both places <VOCNOISE> i mean i wouldn't particularly go up to polaris if they take northland <VOCNOISE> but we're not planning on staying there anyway so i didn't <SIL> yeah <SIL> we'll probably move within the year <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
um the well <SIL> i've had the house <VOCNOISE> excuse me <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> for probably six seven years and <VOCNOISE> we just need to move it's kind of small it's a smaller house <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> my husband works in gahanna so we were gonna <SIL> look for some houses up that way and <VOCNOISE> maybe some land <VOCNOISE> we've been looking at some land <SIL> up north too <IVER>
um-hum <NOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> it's either gonna be find a house we want or we'll go build it <LAUGH-somewhere> <IVER>
oh <SIL> a place on some land <SIL> with <HES-some> woods and uh <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> water things like that <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> right <NOISE> yeah we could put a little trailer there we'd be outside most the time anyway so <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<NOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah i would say anything outside <NOISE> like doing that <IVER>
<NOISE> um-hum <SIL> yeah <SIL> we'd like to garden <SIL> and that was one of the things too we want some space to <SIL> to make a bigger garden and <VOCNOISE> uh no <SIL> uh no we kind of help my neighbor out he's got a big garden next <LAUGH-door> <VOCNOISE> so we help him and <SIL> he's retired <VOCNOISE> oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-okay> good because i don't think i'd know that one <LAUGH> whatever looks pretty when it <LAUGH-comes_out> 
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
uh it's all over they contract with dominion homes <SIL> and dominion is seems like it's going up everywhere and m i <SIL> so they're all over <VOCNOISE> uh they have projects all over <IVER>
uh it's not really an office he's like a um supervisor that just goes to the different job sites <SIL> he <CUTOFF-g=goes> he tells the the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and <VOCNOISE> and then he gets to um <SIL> talk with <HES-the> the other contractors <VOCNOISE> and he works together with them but he's really just <VOCNOISE> there's a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and they're all so different but he's he deals real well with people <SIL> so he's really <VOCNOISE> and he's even thinking of going into uh business <SIL> for himself <NOISE> yeah he almost <ERROR-doed=did> that this year and then he thought nah i don't want all the headaches <VOCNOISE> so he's like the top guy of <CUTOFF-wi=with?> of the people that he works for so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> it'd be good though because i could take care to the books and everything and <VOCNOISE> do all that kind of thing so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah we probably eventually will do that <VOCNOISE> but i'm like so up in the air about what i wanna do and there's <LAUGH-so> many things to do out there that <VOCNOISE> i need to take time to think about it <IVER>
so <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> no <VOCNOISE> i really don't i've done uh i've done a variety of uh <VOCNOISE> different <SIL> things and then also um <VOCNOISE> just reading <SIL> and and things uh since i've been off and <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-wante=wanted> i wanted to go back to school i thought about that and <SIL> i wanna do something with kids <VOCNOISE> i almost thought of opening my own daycare center <SIL> but then i didn't know if i wanted to get into that and <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> just trying to <VOCNOISE> take my time <SIL> do what i wanna do <SIL> yeah <IVER>
oh <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well and that's good for the baby <SIL> too <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> gosh i hate that's really going around a lot <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> let's see i got divorced when my oldest was three and my youngest was about six months almost a year <VOCNOISE> so i've <SIL> i've raised them basically myself <SIL> yeah so i did go back to work <IVER>
uh <HES-s=six> five years ago almost five years ago couple months <SIL> short of that <SIL> oh <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i um well and that was really um <SIL> struggle <SIL> yknow a struggle for money and everything so <VOCNOISE> i would take whatever would come along <SIL> and when you work in secure <SIL> jobs like that i mean you i had a different job <SIL> every year <VOCNOISE> i mean a year would come up and i'd say okay here we go <VOCNOISE> yknow they're either gonna downsize or they're gonna <VOCNOISE> do something and they always did so i was never really shocked <SIL> and i didn't panic or anything <HES-and> i was never without a job and never had to <VOCNOISE> i never missed um <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> i would say it would take <SIL> probably two weeks <SIL> at the most <SIL> before i would be working again <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> eighty four <NOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <SIL> yeah pretty good for secretarial administrative type work i mean everybody's always looking for that <IVER>
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and <VOCNOISE> yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of <VOCNOISE> different yeah i experience with <VOCNOISE> um sexual harassment <IVER>
yeah real bad and and it was <VOCNOISE> yknow mainly um <VOCNOISE> no one talked about it <IVER>
yknow i mean it was just like <VOCNOISE> and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else <VOCNOISE> so you would never wanna <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=say> yknow ever say anything <VOCNOISE> but um yeah that <CUTOFF-i=it?> <IVER>
well <IVER>
i walked out and uh it wasn't quietly <SIL> and i <LAUGH-walked> <LAUGH-out> <VOCNOISE> but it felt good <SIL> and uh <SIL> and i didn't even know if i was gonna be living in the streets <VOCNOISE> but i'll never forget the day yknow and his wife worked in the office too <VOCNOISE> so i went to her and i said it was nice working with you i'm going home yknow <VOCNOISE> can reach me at home <VOCNOISE> and then he was shocked and he just couldn't believe it and he said you can't do this <VOCNOISE> he says i won't pay you <VOCNOISE> and i said <CUTOFF-w=watch> <SIL> uh yknow watch me walk out the door and i don't want any money yknow <VOCNOISE> so i left out <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> oh it was just a <SIL> a long drawn out thing i mean it <CUTOFF-thi=this> started out with little things <VOCNOISE> and then it just got bigger like <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> he had an office <SIL> off of the main office and it was a pretty prominent uh insurance company <VOCNOISE> and he had his own um agency and he was a successful i mean he's probably still is out there very successful <VOCNOISE> but i was doing some computer training and he was walking me to the other side of the <VOCNOISE> building <VOCNOISE> and he locked the door <SIL> and turned around <VOCNOISE> he said why don't you get the <ERROR-first=front> or the front door <SIL> and it was only he and i in the office yknow and every once in a while his wife would be in there <VOCNOISE> and i just i lost it i was i uh <VOCNOISE> i was mad but i i didn't want him to think that i was afraid <VOCNOISE> i wanted to <VOCNOISE> be of him to be afraid of me <VOCNOISE> so i just <SIL> i stomped back to my desk <VOCNOISE> and i said oh <EXT-great> i said not only are you a pain to work with i have to be afraid of you <VOCNOISE> and then i think i did scare him because he start yknow he backed off a lot <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> just his personality and his his <VOCNOISE> and then that that was a real um <SIL> slap in the face for him <VOCNOISE> so he was really mean after that so i left i just i walked out <VOCNOISE> i picked the kids up at the bus stop and they're like mommy what are you doing <VOCNOISE> i said we're going somewhere <CUTOFF-ki=kids?> <CUTOFF-le=lets> get in the <LAUGH-car> <LAUGH> so <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> yeah just couple experiences like that though make you do other things so <VOCNOISE> yknow i stayed <SIL> tough and i <SIL> yknow got other jobs and <IVER>
was pretty good never had to borrow any money <VOCNOISE> never went on welfare <VOCNOISE> didn't <VOCNOISE> i think i was on food stamps or something for a month <IVER>
when i first <SIL> yknow <SIL> got a divorce <VOCNOISE> so it's been hard <IVER>
um uh <SIL> he was in so much trouble <SIL> and he was <VOCNOISE> that was the main reason why i didn't stay with him is he was just draining on me and <VOCNOISE> pulling me down so <VOCNOISE> he was never really there he was in and out of jail all the time <VOCNOISE> and i would go through the whole <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-chuh=child> <SIL> bureau child support <SIL> that whole thing and that was a <SIL> total mess <VOCNOISE> he'd have wasted all the time to go down there to court appearances and all this other stuff well <VOCNOISE> it turned out he could just move <IVER>
he found out he could just move <VOCNOISE> yeah so yknow he always got away from that <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i think they're really helpful and i think that it's the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there's really <VOCNOISE> but there's so much fraud <SIL> and there's so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it <VOCNOISE> yknow like with me i didn't wanna stay on it i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it <VOCNOISE> but if <SIL> i <CUTOFF-w=?> didn't have the ambition <VOCNOISE> that that i had i might have stayed home there's like nine yknow <VOCNOISE> there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that <VOCNOISE> i would get up and go to work every day <VOCNOISE> and she would have food delivered to the her front step <VOCNOISE> and she drove that year's <HES-car> <SIL> i mean she had a brand new <VOCNOISE> yknow like whatever year it was that's the car she had and i <VOCNOISE> i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and <VOCNOISE> yknow i thought <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah she probably got um <VOCNOISE> i don't know maybe even she sold drugs or yknow whatever kind of way she made her money <VOCNOISE> but it wouldn't have been enough <SIL> welfare wise to get a <SIL> car and to <IVER>
support the her <SIL> living conditions or whatever <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for long time which yknow i'm sure she did <VOCNOISE> i don't know i always thought <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i always thought it would be neat to have <SIL> a system like the police have <VOCNOISE> if you don't pay a speeding ticket there's a warrant for your arrest and they come after you <SIL> 
<VOCNOISE> if you don't make a child support payment <VOCNOISE> they should do the same thing i don't know why they don't have a system like that <IVER>
yeah i think that's <CUTOFF-probaba=probably> yknow i'm i'm not that familiar with it now but <VOCNOISE> i think that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that the people fall through <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah that's <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> yep <VOCNOISE> but uh fifty dollars a week <IVER>
yknow you can do anything for fifty dollars a week yknow you could work two two hours a day <VOCNOISE> yknow for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids <VOCNOISE> is really not that much a week so <IVER>
that'd be two hundred dollars a month <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah that was the most somebody could be <VOCNOISE> um ordered to pay <VOCNOISE> being unemployed <IVER>
and i think <CUTOFF yeah eighty four <IVER>
yeah so they adjusted that but then they didn't have any way to <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> enforce that so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i was gonna say i i've seen situations too where i can see their side of it <VOCNOISE> as well because <VOCNOISE> the mothers are used to or the wives are used to being home <SIL> and the husbands support them and in those situations they still want them to <VOCNOISE> they still don't want to go out there and do that and <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and <SIL> yknow they need to look at each one of those cases too <VOCNOISE> because i know there's alimony and all that kind of thing and <VOCNOISE> and that can be <VOCNOISE> detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and yknow <IVER>
and he does have a responsibility but i think there can be a line drawn <SIL> to how responsible he is and <VOCNOISE> how capable the other half would have been yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh yeah <NOISE> yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah well there's too many situations out there <SIL> to have everybody fit in to certain <NOISE> ones that just everyone of them's different <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
not really <SIL> no i was too proud <VOCNOISE> i would have never <VOCNOISE> i would have never <VOCNOISE> i think my dad paid my first month's rent <NOISE> for me though <VOCNOISE> i paid him back <VOCNOISE> and then i never i never wanted to borrow any money <VOCNOISE> i guess just growing up <SIL> the youngest of five <VOCNOISE> i appreciated <SIL> money <IVER>
and i didn't even want yknow and i knew <VOCNOISE> my mom is like if she can save a nickel somewhere yknow she will <VOCNOISE> so i knew that that's how they were and i didn't want to yknow it was my choice to get married it was my choice to have kids and <VOCNOISE> yknow i didn't i didn't feel <NOISE> the need to ask them <VOCNOISE> um well i think <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah they're ok they're parents they're in their seventies now <LAUGH> i <SIL> i take what i need and leave the rest because they've got their own opinions that are <VOCNOISE> a lot different than mine <SIL> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh my brother lives in connecticut <VOCNOISE> um and he's uh with a cement company <VOCNOISE> concrete <NOISE> i'm not even really sure i've never even seen him <SIL> <HES-and> where he lives <VOCNOISE> seen pictures and he comes and visits a lot but i've never <VOCNOISE> gone up there <VOCNOISE> um and his wife's an opera singer so she's real busy and <VOCNOISE> they they just are madly in love he got divorced after seventeen years of <SIL> marriage <VOCNOISE> and found the wife that he has now they've been married for probably almost <SIL> oh i don't know <VOCNOISE> seven eight years <VOCNOISE> and they're real happy <SIL> and his kids are grown and they have kids and <VOCNOISE> yeah the family is really pretty big the immediate family just us is thirty two <VOCNOISE> with our husband's wives and kids <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> so then i have another sister <HES-the> that was married to a doctor and just recently divorced <VOCNOISE> she's one of the ones that wants to <LAUGH=stay_home> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH=and_have> <LAUGH> it's unfair yknow life is unfair nothing ever works and <VOCNOISE> so um she's living in akron <SIL> in a house completely paid for by herself <NOISE> and <VOCNOISE> lives out in the middle of nowhere and complains how lonely she is <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> then i told her if it was me <VOCNOISE> completely alone i'd be in the middle of a city somewhere <SIL> yknow where you see people and <VOCNOISE> i don't know yknow it's just <SIL> you can always see what someone else <SIL> should do or could do whatever <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i she's always trying to recruit people to come and <LAUGH=visit_her> <VOCNOISE> but it's like a two hour drive <SIL> and then <SIL> everybody's busy yknow that's four hours of driving <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> i don't know it's just too hard to <SIL> keep everybody <SIL> in touch that way <VOCNOISE> but <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i have two other sisters <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> one of them is well it's funny because we're all divorced <SIL> out the five of us we're all on <VOCNOISE> one of them is on her third marriage and we're all on our second <VOCNOISE> except for one she's divorced and she hasn't remarried <VOCNOISE> and then my oldest that i told you in akron i guess she's not remarried <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> four girls <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> and then my other sister <VOCNOISE> just recently got divorced <SIL> um this year <SIL> or i guess it was um final end of last year <VOCNOISE> and she's got two kids <SIL> and raising them and <VOCNOISE> so they're all um most of them except for um linda and bobby <VOCNOISE> bobby's the one in <SIL> uh connecticut and linda's in akron <VOCNOISE> but everybody else is within ten minutes of each other <IVER>
ten fifteen minutes <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> yeah we stay pretty close see each other a lot <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah and i'm closer to the ones that that feel the same way i do about <LAUGH=things> <VOCNOISE> my oldest sister yknow <VOCNOISE> i can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i don't stay on very long with her <IVER>
oh its real negative she's real negative about things and <VOCNOISE> and tries to put me down for being positive or <VOCNOISE> yknow i always see a way out of something and she doesn't <SIL> and she i think she gets kind of mad <VOCNOISE> and plus she is feels like she's old at fifty and i said oh my gosh <VOCNOISE> you don't even have any bad habits i said <VOCNOISE> yknow you could live to be a hundred that's fifty more years <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean if you look at it that way <SIL> she's really <VOCNOISE> yknow fifty is not old <SIL> at all to me i mean that's just <VOCNOISE> you as much as you learn <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> you can't trade but <VOCNOISE> yeah my my one sister that's um <SIL> exactly seven years older than me <VOCNOISE> we're the closest <VOCNOISE> and then the sister that's two years older than me <VOCNOISE> she's the same way <SIL> she does a lot of things that i'm like why are you doing that yknow <VOCNOISE> don't <LAUGH=do_that> <VOCNOISE> so she's she pretty much stays <NOISE> low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes through but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah yeah we all get together <VOCNOISE> we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because uh <LAUGH=nobody's_house> is big enough <VOCNOISE> well and then we have so many little kids <VOCNOISE> that it's great because uh we just go to a shelter <VOCNOISE> inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and <VOCNOISE> they can run around the kids run around and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and then you can stay as long as you want you don't <SIL> yknow feel obligated <VOCNOISE> and everybody just brings in food <VOCNOISE> yknow everybody brings their own stuff and it's fun we've <VOCNOISE> yeah it is <VOCNOISE> from thanksgiving to christmas i mean it's just nonstop <SIL> family everywhere <VOCNOISE> so it's fun <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH> not me it's too <CUTOFF-expensi=expensive> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i contributed to too many people there's too many people there's not enough committment <VOCNOISE> it's too easy to get divorced <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> it uh the competition <SIL> i mean there's just tons and tons of <VOCNOISE> um just people <NOISE> everywhere and <VOCNOISE> young people today i don't <SIL> i yknow i don't know what the statistics are gonna be but <VOCNOISE> they <SIL> i don't think they have a good idea of what marriage even is <VOCNOISE> yknow before <VOCNOISE> and also before a marriage was a committment to <HES-a> a type of lifestyle <VOCNOISE> and that lifestyle's gone everybody's independent <VOCNOISE> everybody's going their own ways <VOCNOISE> and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that <VOCNOISE> is looking in the same direction you are and <VOCNOISE> is equally as independent <SIL> then <CUTOFF-the=then> might it might work <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> i yknow <VOCNOISE> and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual <VOCNOISE> situation <VOCNOISE> and uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <NOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i know i was really young when i met my husband i was fourteen <VOCNOISE> in high school so we kind of grew up together and <VOCNOISE> i didn't know anything else <VOCNOISE> and um just two complete different people <SIL> yknow different needs and <VOCNOISE> everything else so <IVER>
yeah well i didn't realize that until i had kids <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and i had two little girls <VOCNOISE> and i thought wait a minute yknow i my whole life changed because <VOCNOISE> my committment was to them and to <VOCNOISE> yknow get all the opportunities that were out there for them <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and it just didn't happen that yknow <SIL> well that we both had the same <VOCNOISE> he wanted everything to be the same <LAUGH> yknow <VOCNOISE> so i think that really changed everything <SIL> one could have <NOISE> it does you're whole focus changes because <SIL> everything you say somebody's listening and everything you want to do somebody's watching and 
<VOCNOISE> yknow you have to be a good example <VOCNOISE> i mean if you <VOCNOISE> if you're just that for your <NOISE-kids> <NOISE> then <NOISE-that's> all they <NOISE-need> <VOCNOISE> yknow you might not always do the right things or say the right things but <VOCNOISE> if you're taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the <NOISE-right_things> then <VOCNOISE> think that's the best you can do for them <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> uh yeah i think it's real important to really good uh <SIL> get a good <SIL> <EXT-uh> feel for how you are and <VOCNOISE> all your beliefs and all that they have to really match <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and if they don't <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> then it's not ever going to work because because there's always gonna be <VOCNOISE> conflict and <VOCNOISE> friction and all that kind of thing so i think it's real important <VOCNOISE> and there's no age limit on that to when you really feel <NOISE_good> about yourself and you really know what you want to do <VOCNOISE> then that's the only time that you can really commit <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and say yeah we do have a mutual <VOCNOISE> thing <VOCNOISE> and young people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> their <SIL> yknow there's so many different infatuations to start with <VOCNOISE> that they get blinded and they get <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> off course and everything else and <VOCNOISE> and then it doesn't stay the same <VOCNOISE> i mean it's all exciting and <VOCNOISE> and all that <SIL> and then it yknow i think it's kind of <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah <VOCNOISE> i was never gonna get married again i had my house my kids yknow i had already done that <VOCNOISE> i was financially secure and i didn't <VOCNOISE> i wasn't even looking <VOCNOISE> one of my best friends though at the time <VOCNOISE> uh she saw this <SIL> guy she <CUTOFF-iy=he> he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing <VOCNOISE> and i talked to this girl <SIL> every day and she's like <SIL> oh you have to meet him you have to meet him <VOCNOISE> i was like oh yknow call me tomorrow i don't <LAUGH-want_to> meet anybody <VOCNOISE> so it took a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were <VOCNOISE> she was right <VOCNOISE> i mean uh we were like inseparable from <VOCNOISE> probably of two weeks <SIL> after we met <SIL> we just i've <VOCNOISE> haven't been without him <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and it's been five years this year that we've been married <VOCNOISE> and uh close to seven that i've known him so <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> and it's still just as exciting it's still just as good and <VOCNOISE> yeah he amazes me everyday because i'm <SIL> i'm one to <SIL> all this won't last forever but <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> and he's like well when we're ninety <LAUGH> yknow you'll know <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i know <SIL> its good one of us <LAUGH=feels_that_way> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<NOISE-no> <VOCNOISE> no but he has a daughter <SIL> and that was from high school <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> his girlfriend <SIL> yeah i got pregnant <SIL> and then <VOCNOISE> he stayed with her and they tried to work <NOISE-things> out and they never got married and <VOCNOISE> that was when you lived in canada <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> so she lives in canada now and he goes <SIL> yknow he talks to her all the time <VOCNOISE> and then they're real <SIL> open about that i mean she's real good about letting <VOCNOISE> the little girl come <SIL> and she'll stay the <NOISE-summer_with> us and <VOCNOISE> yknow he'll drive up there and see her <NOISE-too> <IVER>
uh-huh <SIL> his daughter's twelve <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um seventeen and nineteen <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah and <SIL> uh she's adorable <IVER>
uh she's real good <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah everything's healthy <VOCNOISE> and great um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she and then my daughter i mean i think she's just gonna be a real good influence she's a single mom <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> the father <VOCNOISE> is in another relationship and probably on his way to be getting married and <VOCNOISE> yknow so it doesn't look like he's gonna be in the picture that much <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> she had trouble trying to decide whether she wanted him <SIL> to be too <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> because you <IVER>
right <IVER>
<NOISE-um> he doesn't seem <SIL> he doesn't seem to have any problem it's always been yknow what ever she <LAUGH=wants> i know <VOCNOISE> so far <SIL> it's worked out <SIL> pretty well so yknow i'm sure in a situation like that things are gonna come up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but we'll we'll deal with it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<EXT-no> <VOCNOISE> no <LAUGH-she_wa> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well she stayed um <SIL> she stayed with us <SIL> like for the first <NOISE-week> <VOCNOISE> and then she was done she was like ready to go <VOCNOISE> so and that was okay but <VOCNOISE> her apartment <VOCNOISE> lease was up <SIL> the <SIL> uh week <VOCNOISE> that she was in the hospital having the baby <VOCNOISE> so i had to move her <VOCNOISE> and uh my husband's family was visiting at the time <SIL> and so <VOCNOISE> his mom stayed she lives in florida <SIL> and she stayed with me <VOCNOISE> and helped me pack her whole apartment <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> get her in to her new apartment and <VOCNOISE> and that was just yknow <IVER>
well i know <LAUGH> and yknow when i think back about that week that was just crazy <SIL> because it was on a saturday morning she went into labor <SIL> so i was up <SIL> all night <SIL> saturday and <VOCNOISE> all day sunday i didn't get home till <SIL> sunday night <SIL> and then <SIL> <CUTOFF-hi=his> <SIL> oh his his brother from vancouver <VOCNOISE> his daughter from canada <SIL> and his <SIL> mom from florida <SIL> were staying with us <SIL> and they were leaving that tuesday <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah it was like <VOCNOISE> yeah uh <EXCLUDE-name> was <VOCNOISE> five weeks early <SIL> delivering <VOCNOISE> so it was really yknow unplanned as far as when we were expecting it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> you were past ready <LAUGH> <SIL> yeah <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh gosh <IVER>
oh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> when you think about the different generations and things we certainly didn't have the things to worry about <SIL> <NOISE-that_people_do_now> <VOCNOISE> who knows in elementary and junior high and <VOCNOISE> we would have never dreamed <VOCNOISE> of anybody having good <NOISE_gun> <NOISE> or even in let alone a knife <VOCNOISE> i mean that <VOCNOISE> and that's violence and that's that goes back to kids <VOCNOISE> and how much time and and effort you put in to them <VOCNOISE> yknow kids are ignored and pushed aside and they're in the way and there's so many people that <VOCNOISE> don't even want them and <VOCNOISE> yknow and then they get in to school and they get violent <SIL> and they they take it out <HES-uh> yknow and everybody's surprised <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i'm not because i know there's a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> and going to school <VOCNOISE> is getting to be so dangerous <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> because you have so many of them in one little room <VOCNOISE> and they're coming from so many different backgrounds <VOCNOISE> and if you take each one of their situations <VOCNOISE> i can bet the statistics as time goes on <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> they <CUTOFF-di=did> <VOCNOISE> they're not gonna have <VOCNOISE> one caring parent <SIL> yknow maybe not even one of the parents <SIL> yknow they might have a foster family or <VOCNOISE> yknow somebody that wants to pretend like they care yknow there's a lot of the people that <VOCNOISE> that are foster families that only want the money <SIL> yknow and <VOCNOISE> and there's <CUTOFF-th=that> all that so <SIL> it's <SIL> it's really scary and i think <SIL> i think that it had something has to be done real <NOISE-fast_I_don't_know_what> <VOCNOISE> i think it starts from <VOCNOISE> what we teach them <VOCNOISE> and as adults what we allow <SIL> to be out there <VOCNOISE> the computers <VOCNOISE> i mean oh my gosh <VOCNOISE> i didn't even get a computer because i was so afraid of what <VOCNOISE> they could be able to <VOCNOISE> access there was not <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> there was nothing barred at <VOCNOISE> all when they first came out <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> and yknow where are all those software people they're not responsible for <VOCNOISE> y two k they're not responsible for <VOCNOISE> yknow all this internet access to all the stuff <VOCNOISE> so it's really hard <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well when you have formulas to make bombs and yknow <IVER>
how to <VOCNOISE> uh step by step of how to commit suicide and <VOCNOISE> yeah they have to be responsible i think <VOCNOISE> because yknow you put an idea in to somebody's head and then <VOCNOISE> when you give them the resources to carry <NOISE-these> those things out <VOCNOISE> i think it's <VOCNOISE> it has to be <NOISE-responsible> for a lot of it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
but it <SIL> and it's <SIL> it's parents that fight for <SIL> the <NOISE-society> <VOCNOISE> and the what's in your community <VOCNOISE> yknow the parents for each individual child <VOCNOISE> they have to all form together as a group <VOCNOISE> and almost be <VOCNOISE> all parents to <VOCNOISE> all these kids <SIL> as a group <VOCNOISE> yknow it's not <VOCNOISE> you can be the best parent in the world at home <SIL> and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they <VOCNOISE> get in a group of kids where their <VOCNOISE> parents they don't even know where they are <SIL> yknow it's the kids responsibility to get <VOCNOISE> and go to school <VOCNOISE> yknow maybe the mom and dad didn't even come home the night before but <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean there's all different kinds of situations <VOCNOISE> so i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what <VOCNOISE> all the kids are being <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> shown and <SIL> and have access to <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah you really do <SIL> yeah 
<IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> right and you know what's gonna happen <SIL> it's only when it gets so bad <SIL> that they can't even walk to their car they can't even go to <SIL> to the store <VOCNOISE> without being affected by that they can't say that anymore <SIL> yknow it's the people that <VOCNOISE> if i don't see it it's not there <SIL> they're the ones that are gonna be the most shocked <SIL> and they're the ones that are gonna be <VOCNOISE> panicked <SIL> when everything yknow because it's getting smaller the world's getting smaller we're <SIL> we're more populated now than we ever have been <SIL> so people need to learn to work together and to be together <SIL> and <IVER>
gosh <VOCNOISE> yknow that's one of the things that i've really yknow when i read the paper i think wow what can you do <VOCNOISE> it has to start there first <SIL> yknow and i think if <SIL> um <SIL> and i <LAUGH> <SIL> and this might be because i'm a woman but <VOCNOISE> i think if women <VOCNOISE> started running things <VOCNOISE> it would be a lot different than when men <SIL> run things because <VOCNOISE> men tend to <SIL> think yknow like the government and that kind of thing <VOCNOISE> those <VOCNOISE> kind of um <VOCNOISE> funds <VOCNOISE> that are available for different organizations and <VOCNOISE> they're all geared toward things that <VOCNOISE> essentially help them <SIL> as a whole <SIL> or help um <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> yeah but i mean not so much that um <VOCNOISE> it's always been the women's responsibility to be responsible for the kids <VOCNOISE> or to care about their well being and the a <SIL> peaceful environment and all that kind of thing <VOCNOISE> men are more <VOCNOISE> let's go get it and yknow we need more money and <SIL> yknow they're <IVER>
yeah more <UNKNOWN> yeah or more <VOCNOISE> yknow i don't i don't even know <SIL> because to start it's just such a huge problem and it's gotten so out of hand <VOCNOISE> it's gonna be everybody all together that has to work it's gonna be the teachers and the <VOCNOISE> government and <VOCNOISE> everybody but they all have to have one common thing <SIL> and it cracks me up because <VOCNOISE> we're so concerned about elian <SIL> this this poor little kid <VOCNOISE> everybody knows who he is <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow you look at our own kids we don't even care about our own kids as much as we care <VOCNOISE> i mean here's this little kid <VOCNOISE> who still has a living parent <SIL> and and i don't understand that at all i mean that is just so <VOCNOISE> i think the government gets involved in <SIL> totally yknow <SIL> way out of line <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
yeah yeah <VOCNOISE> i don't i don't know but it then then they second guess <VOCNOISE> the mother and she risked her life and all and they <NOISE> they can't do that <VOCNOISE> i mean yknow it's too bad that <SIL> yknow she wasn't there to <VOCNOISE> to go on with what they were planning on doing but <VOCNOISE> it's not our right to to take other countries kids even <VOCNOISE> i mean that's another thing <VOCNOISE> i mean come to america we'll take everyone and every yknow <VOCNOISE> but then we have all these this crime <SIL> because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that's all they've grown up with <SIL> is the terrorist activities and <VOCNOISE> the mentality and all that they come here and if they can't make it <SIL> then they'll just bomb somewhere and <SIL> then <LAUGH> but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that yknow you uh you kind of <VOCNOISE> wanna do a study of how long they've been here and <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> that'd be interesting <VOCNOISE> um i think there's gotta be a line drawn <SIL> and i think that um <SIL> yknow if they're <SIL> if they're caught um and and it's any kind of crime or anything and i know they send them back <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <SIL> i just think that we're just too open with that and there's gotta be a line to say <VOCNOISE> this is as many people as as we care to yknow <SIL> i mean and i know that's hard but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and it's hard to draw the line but then other countries <SIL> if it's so miserable there <SIL> then they need to work on their <SIL> country <SIL> because <IVER>
whoa i yeah really <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um <IVER>
yeah one is still in high school and she <SIL> she's ready to she wants to go on to college <SIL> so she's pretty much <SIL> ready <SIL> to go i mean she do she's got one more year <SIL> of high school but <SIL> uh and i held her back in kindergarten <VOCNOISE> so she's <VOCNOISE> older graduate she'll be nineteen when she graduates <SIL> and then <EXCLUDE-name> on the other hand graduated when she was seventeen <SIL> so <SIL> um <SIL> then my youngest daughter amy she is uh <VOCNOISE> she's doing real well i mean she's getting really good grades a's and b's <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> with <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> she had kind of a hard time <SIL> in high school <SIL> she was <SIL> uh raped <SIL> by a teacher in ninth grade <SIL> when she first went into a school <SIL> and from there it's just been a nightmare of what <SIL> how that it's affected her <SIL> yknow anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back and you say oh i wonder <SIL> you know if she was like that because of this and <SIL> yknow so that's been a real struggle and high school <SIL> i was <SIL> i never really <SIL> was that um excited about it for her because the memories she has <SIL> she went on to a different school and she met a lot of good people there <VOCNOISE> and she <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah ever authority figures at all <SIL> yknow she's she's really strong about that though because <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> she doesn't look at anybody being <SIL> be uh <VOCNOISE> yknow maybe <SIL> more wiser more experienced in things but <SIL> yknow certainly she doesn't trust anybody <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <SIL> yeah and that's the thing about schools too <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> totally disagree with uniforms <SIL> yknow unless it's <SIL> all slacks <SIL> all of it <VOCNOISE> because you get the <VOCNOISE> the girls in the uniforms and they're short <SIL> and they can't enforce that they don't enforce that <SIL> and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row <SIL> i should have went and met him <SIL> or i should have said hey yknow hey this uh yknow <VOCNOISE> haven't met me and i and i really <VOCNOISE> yknow fault myself for that <SIL> but it's made me more aware too and i <SIL> yknow when you look at someone and you say oh you would never dream that they <VOCNOISE> well i do <SIL> yknow there isn't anything i don't <SIL> put past anybody doing <VOCNOISE> i really don't cause they just <SIL> yeah <SIL> oh <LAUGH> <LAUGH=no> no no i do because there's some good ones out there there's some bad ones too but yknow <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> um it's awareness again <SIL> i mean <SIL> yknow put two and two together you get some young <VOCNOISE> teachers <SIL> right out of of college <SIL> and then you put em with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean <VOCNOISE> you can't even <SIL> you can't control the attraction there <SIL> but you can be aware of it <SIL> and you can <SIL> you can um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> put the put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> they've got stairs up and down and <VOCNOISE> yknow they get in their lockers and they bend over yknow and that's <SIL> that's just too much <VOCNOISE> i mean i think that's the first thing that has to be done take away <VOCNOISE> that yknow they shouldn't even be <VOCNOISE> uh that shouldn't even be a thought <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> and it's distracting enough for the the guys their own age <VOCNOISE> but then you put these young teachers in there maybe they're single guys that were just had a hell of a time in hall in college <VOCNOISE> and then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh <VOCNOISE> well yknow you gotta look at that you gotta be more aware <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i think <SIL> i think that there should be <SIL> a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory um sexual harassment tapes <SIL> and <SIL> and you learn you teach the girls <SIL> that it's not what they do it's how they make you feel <SIL> is is <SIL> constituted as your uh <SIL> yeah harassment there <SIL> and they're too afraid <SIL> and then besides that they yknow there's crushes on yknow you can't fault the girls for having crushes and <VOCNOISE> things like that they're going through enough things as it is <IVER>
but you can make them aware if somebody <SIL> as an adult steps over that <SIL> line <SIL> or makes them uncomfortable <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> there should be some kind of a s <SIL> a system <SIL> to where these girls the slightest bit <SIL> yknow it's anonymous it's <SIL> yknow <IVER>
probably but they don't they won't <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> part of is they feel flattered part of it is like wow the yknow this guy thinks i'm nice looking or whatever 
<VOCNOISE> and yknow you can have a hard thing there but <VOCNOISE> then if you teach the teachers that they're not gonna be quiet and they're not gonna <VOCNOISE> yknow um look at this flattery <IVER>
right <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> yknow that's that's the thing so <VOCNOISE> i think just being aware <SIL> and then also <VOCNOISE> like i said with uh with all the <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=and> and i'm uh <SIL> i'm so <SIL> opinionated in this too and anybody that <SIL> knows me <VOCNOISE> i look at all the advertising <VOCNOISE> i look at the advertising and i look through and like i see lazarus and i see kohl's and i see <VOCNOISE> sears <VOCNOISE> you look through and you say oh okay you know you're looking for things to buy well then you got a two whole <SIL> two pages <VOCNOISE> of women in bras <VOCNOISE> and they're looking at the camera they're seductively looking at the camera <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> you're like okay how many <CUTOFF-wo=women> how many different bras do women really need <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-that> <LAUGH-is> not for the women i'm sorry yknow <VOCNOISE> most women by the time they're <CUTOFF-bu=buying> buying bras know what choices they have <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yknow_they> don't need all that <VOCNOISE> but then it's funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at the men <VOCNOISE> the men's heads are usually cut off <VOCNOISE> they're not wearing any kind of revealing <VOCNOISE> underwear at all i mean it's just so <VOCNOISE> unequal so <VOCNOISE> we lead these these guys or these poor boys that are growing up <VOCNOISE> we push all this and yknow <VOCNOISE> and then expect them to deal with it <VOCNOISE> yknow and they see tv shows and <VOCNOISE> and everything else that yknow <VOCNOISE> it's okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she's yknow <VOCNOISE> i mean i think it's what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and <VOCNOISE> and what we're allowed to to show our kids <SIL> yknow you get involved in the free speech <VOCNOISE> and that's fine <VOCNOISE> but wait till those kids grow up <VOCNOISE> and and wait till those people that were pushing the free speech <VOCNOISE> gets mugged <CUTOFF-o=or> or yknow anything else happens to them <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <IVER>
the yeah um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-governma=government> or the yeah the government <VOCNOISE> mayors the yknow but then look at them <SIL> i mean there's another example <VOCNOISE> well yeah well i mean <LAUGH> so that's not the <CUTOFF-pra=problem> that's not the case but it's all it's an uh uh man too <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean i think women would be more efficient and they would see those things because we've had to live with them forever <VOCNOISE> yknow even g movies that little kids are going to see <SIL> if there's a woman in there <IVER>
there she's yknow half naked <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> and she's <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> should be a center fold somewhere <VOCNOISE> yknow and those are little <CUTOFF-kid=kids> yeah <VOCNOISE> disney movies cartoons <VOCNOISE> i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and it's really scary <VOCNOISE> um but nobody's doing anything about it that i can see <VOCNOISE> and they don't really see a concern but like i said <VOCNOISE> wait till the generations start growing up <VOCNOISE> wait till those little kids that we've put all those things in their head <VOCNOISE> grows up <VOCNOISE> then they'll think wow we should have done something <VOCNOISE> i know well i'm <SIL> i'm scared i hope i don't live real long because <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> it's it's scary well and then the guy that um <SIL> i don't even remember what his name was he got <VOCNOISE> a drunk driving <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> charge <VOCNOISE> a judge he was a judge <VOCNOISE> now he's out <SIL> he went back to work on monday <IVER>
so yknow what kind of example is he setting for everybody else <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh we throw the book away <SIL> on some of these other <CUTOFF-guy=guys> i mean the throw the key away <VOCNOISE> on some of these guys <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> yknow we want set them an as an example and <VOCNOISE> yknow this one guy had one <VOCNOISE> d u i two years ago so we really <CUTOFF-ha=have> to he's gotta be in jail for five years yknow <VOCNOISE> then this judge <VOCNOISE> i mean he's got <VOCNOISE> probably ten years of history with drugs and alcohol <VOCNOISE> and he's still and he's still a judge <LAUGH> monday morning he goes to work <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah i don't see figure that out i think it's all <SIL> i think it's all <LAUGH-fixed> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah they don't know about it but then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow they <VOCNOISE> like you said they don't wanna see it <IVER>
yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=if> <VOCNOISE> if it doesn't affect them it's not there <VOCNOISE> and if they don't have to <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well people's <NOISE> people don't have the priorities they should <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die <VOCNOISE> what did you do <LAUGH> yknow <VOCNOISE> did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything <NOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i not to me if you don't have time then <VOCNOISE> yknow you're just floating along trying to <LAUGH> taking up space no <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah we <NOISE> yup <SIL> you have to concentrate on what's important or it just flies by and you don't even see it <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah right <VOCNOISE> can't take it with you or something <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
right <SIL> yeah well you can't even put a price on it either <VOCNOISE> so it's <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> i think i thrive on stress <LAUGH> i think it keeps me uh going or something <VOCNOISE> but i do have to do something that <SIL> is accomplishing something <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna sit in an office i've already done that <VOCNOISE> day in and day out working for other people that i don't even approve of <VOCNOISE> that are making way too much money anyway <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH=yknow> <VOCNOISE> and uh have to <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH=yeah> <LAUGH> well looking at me oh you want a dollar more yknow i mean <VOCNOISE> and they're making thousands <VOCNOISE> um but yeah i don't wanna do that any more i wanna go somewhere i've got somebody <VOCNOISE> helping me kind of yknow um just an acquaintance of mine <VOCNOISE> um that's kind of a headhunter <SIL> and i've given him the idea that <VOCNOISE> i wanna either work for an attorney that's gonna make some changes or <VOCNOISE> yknow do something that way i've got a lot of administration <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> and and manager and things like that background so <VOCNOISE> i can have fun doing what i know how to do but also <SIL> accomplishing something <VOCNOISE> that's what i wanna do i haven't found it yet i've got an interview with a radio station though and that's kinda <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
off the thing a <LAUGH=little_bit> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> because that'll be fun <IVER>
yeah just in their corporate offices <SIL> and that would be fun so <VOCNOISE> eventually i'll have my own radio <LAUGH=station> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-though> <LAUGH> if they interviewed me and knew that they'd be like quick get that girl out of here <VOCNOISE> no but that that's like the most exciting <SIL> thing right now is that i mean that looks real <SIL> promising but <VOCNOISE> and if i do that then i'm gonna have to do something <VOCNOISE> voluntary <SIL> or some <SIL> uh <SIL> voluntary work or uh <VOCNOISE> choices <VOCNOISE> uh i looked at that too that's choices for domestic violence <VOCNOISE> that's an organization that i think would be real interesting and <VOCNOISE> help me feel like yknow <VOCNOISE> helping people <VOCNOISE> um they give <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> new direction for abused <SIL> <SIL> uh wives and mothers and <VOCNOISE> um help them get on their feet yknow give them access to the different organizations that are out there <VOCNOISE> basically hide them until they can get on their own because if they're abused the <VOCNOISE> husbands are like yknow a nightmare out there <VOCNOISE> so things like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> yeah i'd be so frustrated i'd probably <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh <SIL> i would be really <IVER>
oh <SIL> oh <SIL> wow <VOCNOISE> oh see and she's probably really good <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah see <IVER>
<NOISE> yup <IVER>
really <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> i don't feel old at all i mean i <VOCNOISE> yknow a lot of people think wow you should know what you wanna do or yknow <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and i guess <VOCNOISE> there is different phases like uh maslow's <SIL> hierarchy <SIL> what is that the um the hierarchy of needs <SIL> <ERROR-Masler=Maslow> <VOCNOISE> Maslow <VOCNOISE> anyway <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he has different levels of things that people need different ages and things like that uh <VOCNOISE> yknow and at forty <VOCNOISE> you you think wow yknow and you really need to <VOCNOISE> make a difference or do something and and i can see that cause i've gone through all the phases that he's talking about so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <NOISE> right <SIL> yeah <SIL> <NOISE> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
oh <LAUGH> no that's fine <SIL> <LAUGH> thanks <IVER>
oh <IVER>
oh i was gonna say it would be interesting <IVER>
yep 
um okay well i'm not really from columbus either <VOCNOISE> i've been here for a little over a year now <VOCNOISE> my husband went to high school here <VOCNOISE> and had a <CUTOFF-d=daughter> <SIL> daughter while he was in high school so <VOCNOISE> after he finished college he wanted to relocate here <VOCNOISE> and we kind of live between worthington and westerville <VOCNOISE> kind of <VOCNOISE> north <VOCNOISE> columbus <VOCNOISE> and i like it a lot <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> i've always lived in ohio <VOCNOISE> so i'm a native ohioian <VOCNOISE> southern ohio <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> right now i'm staying at home with my two boys i have a one year old and a five year old <VOCNOISE> and um my profession is a nurse i'm a yeah <VOCNOISE> but i've <SIL> been taking a little while off since i've had the baby <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> i i've pretty much have <SIL> picked up the belief in attachment parenting since i've had my second child <VOCNOISE> and i <CUTOFF-ca=can't> <VOCNOISE> it's where you believe in breast feeding from birth <VOCNOISE> until whenever and holding yknow like <VOCNOISE> carrying the baby in a sling with you and <VOCNOISE> just being available for the baby's needs and just <VOCNOISE> no not really <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> oh i i feel a huge difference for me personally <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> just in the um closeness and <VOCNOISE> being able to pick up on his cues a lot better <VOCNOISE> and just knowing his needs <IVER>
and being able to meet them quicker and <SIL> more effectively i think <VOCNOISE> so yeah <VOCNOISE> oh yeah <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> i know <LAUGH> <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> that's another thing i forgot to mention <LAUGH> <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> exactly <SIL> just from family <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> oh yeah <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> but it was something i've learned just from the other parents <VOCNOISE> well <CUTOFF-m=mostly> <VOCNOISE> mostly mothers that <VOCNOISE> i yknow talk to is <VOCNOISE> that yknow <VOCNOISE> if it's not necessary <SIL> to <SIL> say it then it's necessary not to say it so <VOCNOISE> it's just kind of a <SIL> in your home type of thing and you don't really go around saying <SIL> yeah we sleep in the same bed and <VOCNOISE> we breast feed still and <LAUGH> <SIL> you just kind of they ask and you're like yeah well <VOCNOISE> yeah that's just the way we're doing it so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> how appaling oh yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> my my family my mom especially is just like when are you gonna stop <VOCNOISE> doing that <VOCNOISE> yeah because he's sixteen months now and <VOCNOISE> i think he's tapering off quite a bit so <VOCNOISE> i think that he'll be done soon but i'm not pushing him so <IVER>
i think so <SIL> he's he's not being forced to go in any direction that he's not ready for <SIL> yeah i was going to college and <VOCNOISE> and going to work and <SIL> i mean i think that their personalities are different too though <SIL> so he was very independent but i'm not sure that that's just <SIL> his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put being put and <SIL> being in daycare from a very very young age and <SIL> and then <SIL> yknow my youngest he's never been in daycare at all <SIL> so <IVER>
it just <SIL> just kind of <SIL> instincts i <LAUGH-guess> <SIL> yeah actually there are <SIL> quite a there's an <VOCNOISE> an a well pretty well known doctor that has a ton of books and <SIL> i go to la leche league and <SIL> that's kind of their philosophy in a way <SIL> yeah <SIL> just that breast feeding is yknow a way to mother <SIL> and nurture and feed and yknow it <SIL> it meets all of these needs it's kind of like <SIL> it's just <SIL> yeah <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> oh i believe it <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> well one of my la leche league leaders she has a p h d <VOCNOISE> and she does a lot of reading <SIL> and she said that she actually read a study <VOCNOISE> that they did um for breast fed babies to bottle fed babies <SIL> and they said the difference in their i q <SIL> is equivalent to uh <SIL> a regular <SIL> bottle fed baby <SIL> and a baby exposed to lead poisoning <VOCNOISE> it's that much higher even <CUTOFF-clipping=so> so i mean it's just given them that much of uh <VOCNOISE> better <SIL> head start <SIL> on development <SIL> so <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's fine <SIL> hum-um <SIL> i don't <SIL> my husband does but i kind of sleep between them when they're <VOCNOISE> but right now i've cause we've <SIL> early on we <VOCNOISE> took our bed down and just kind of had like the mattress and the boxspring on the floor <VOCNOISE> and i've got like comforters <VOCNOISE> on the side of the bed <VOCNOISE> so cause he's like <VOCNOISE> he'll like get out he's just like i don't wanna be in the bed with these guys and he'll get on the floor and <VOCNOISE> he'll sleep on the comforters on the floor but he's close and <VOCNOISE> he's happy that <LAUGH-way> <LAUGH> <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> right there <IVER>
yeah that yeah <SIL> um-hum <SIL> i think the mother has more of an instinct for that <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> as far as the studies go where the people roll over their babies i don't see how you can roll over on <SIL> anything that size and not know it <SIL> unless you were on drugs or drunk or <SIL> whatever <SIL> you know what i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah because i couldn't imagine rolling over on 
<SIL> anything that was foreign in my bed and not knowing it it would wake me up <SIL> especially i mean i think you <VOCNOISE> kind of have <HES-word> <SIL> different <VOCNOISE> level of awareness <VOCNOISE> when you are a mother and you're sleeping in a bed with your <VOCNOISE> infant <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
pretty well <SIL> there <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think that's a little harder because he was an only child for <VOCNOISE> nearly five years <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> it's been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother <SIL> it's it's really he he nurtures him too so <SIL> it's neat to watch <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> right and they're in so much competition <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
well actually i've <SIL> picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> i'm working for a research firm <VOCNOISE> just for the convenience of the hours i i want to get back into the nursing field but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> right now i just can't <SIL> take that much time <SIL> away <SIL> because that would be least an eight hour shift and <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> don't <SIL> think <SIL> that we're ready for that <LAUGHyet> <VOCNOISE> he's a teacher <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> he works at a high school yeah <SIL> he teaches ninth and tenth graders <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> no <SIL> <LAUGH-I> don't think that at all <LAUGH> i'd be deceiving myself i think <VOCNOISE> i i guess when i <SIL> i heard about him i'm just like oh my gosh i can't believe <VOCNOISE> all of the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the things that these kids are experiencing i didn't <VOCNOISE> know about <SIL> whatever until i was much much older i didn't worry about that when i was that age and <VOCNOISE> it's kind of scary <IVER>
i have no <LAUGH-idea> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> i guess my <SIL> i guess what i would say <SIL> mostly for that is that <VOCNOISE> the parents are too busy with their own careers <VOCNOISE> and they don't take time <SIL> to raise their kids <VOCNOISE> and establish the morals <VOCNOISE> in the home <VOCNOISE> and they're just like oh well they'll learn it <SIL> there <VOCNOISE> whatever <VOCNOISE> and the kids <SIL> um <SIL> they're <SIL> basic <SIL> where they learn things is their peers they don't get it <SIL> everything instilled at home <VOCNOISE> that's pretty much <SIL> what <SIL> yknow i've <VOCNOISE> seen talking to my husband and <VOCNOISE> yknow and there's so many broken homes and single moms and trying to <VOCNOISE> trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to <VOCNOISE> grow up before they're ready <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> but yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> the media exposure <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i blame it on that yeah because yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's been a lot more kids that have died in school <VOCNOISE> then yknow <SIL> just recently i guess it wasn't in the biggin numbers at one time <VOCNOISE> but there's been random <SIL> violence in schools yknow <SIL> where kids would die even more than <VOCNOISE> yknow seven or whatever <SIL> and i think that the media's just made it into something <VOCNOISE> that they've glamorized it and some of the kids i think are screwed up anyway and they're just like well hey yknow <SIL> i can do that and i'll be on the <CUTOFF-te=tv> yeah <SIL> i do i think that's a big part of that <SIL> because they want <SIL> their name known and they don't care if they die anyway <VOCNOISE> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> it's been glamorized and they don't <SIL> they don't value <SIL> human life either <SIL> i don't think because there's so much violence <SIL> yknow you can't <SIL> watch tv and not seeing <VOCNOISE> somebody get shot or something <SIL> and it's just like it's not really real <VOCNOISE> because it's yknow you turn the channel and you see the same actor doing something else and you're like see it wasn't real and <VOCNOISE> i don't think they <SIL> i think <SIL> i don't know <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah because they think they're grown <SIL> they think they're grown and they're like <SIL> twelve and thirteen and they've been having sex since they were ten and <VOCNOISE> it's just <VOCNOISE-like-gosh> <LAUGH-gosh> <VOCNOISE> and you know how and they're having babies earlier and earlier and <SIL> it's just really <SIL> scary <IVER>
i think it should be the parent's responsibility <SIL> but i have no objection to them teaching it <SIL> somewhat in the schools i guess <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> i don't know that they <HES-would> use the <LAUGH-information> if they had it <LAUGH> <LAUGH> i i don't know <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i personally agree with that but that's just from my own moral beliefs and <VOCNOISE> everything but i don't know <SIL> i i don't think that there's one solution that'll fit every <SIL> every <SIL> child and every situation <VOCNOISE> i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so <VOCNOISE> yknow obviously his he said his dad told him about condoms yknow so <SIL> they're gonna make that decision on their own i say just <SIL> and and plus with the internet and everything they <SIL> they have access to so much information <SIL> and i think that it falls back on the parents still <SIL> if you're gonna be a parent you need to be <LAUGH-responsible> <VOCNOISE> and i don't think that <SIL> it's getting done <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum 
<IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
hum-um <IVER>
hum-um <IVER>
i don't i don't think so <SIL> but <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> i doubt it <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> i think he needs counseling <LAUGH-at> that point <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hmm personally no i don't think so <IVER>
hum-um <IVER>
i had considered that yes <IVER>
i just <VOCNOISE> actually i was going to send my son to a <HES-christian> kindergarten but i decided to home school instead so i've been home schooling him for kindergarten <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> because i want his morals and <CUTOFF-hi-=his> yknow <SIL> his <VOCNOISE> basic stuff to come from me <SIL> really <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> exactly i wish i would have taken typing and home ec in high school <VOCNOISE> and i was too busy with college prep and <VOCNOISE> yknow what good did that do me <LAUGH> <IVER>
i <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> life skills <LAUGH> <IVER>
exactly <LAUGH-huge> <IVER>
everybody needs to know that <NOISE> information <VOCNOISE> for credit cards <IVER>
yeah my husband was one of those <IVER>
we're still working those <LAUGH-problems-out> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
and it stays with you for years <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> they don't realize that nobody tells them until after the <LAUGH-fact> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> i have no idea <LAUGH> <LAUGH> <IVER>
i i <HES-word> knew that kindergarten because it's <SIL> it's not required in the state of ohio <SIL> anyway they really aren't required to be <VOCNOISE> in school or enrolled in anything until they're six by september <VOCNOISE> when i found that out <EXCLUDE-I> was like oh ok cool <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-y-=you> can keep them home i mean he's <VOCNOISE> he could probably go into the second grade i mean <SIL> he's <SIL> very bright he can read and write and <VOCNOISE> add and <HES-_he> he yknow he's <SIL> so it's a challenge for me <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah <LAUGH> oh yeah <SIL> we're crazy <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he's an educator which is all the more reason to <LAUGH-home-school> <VOCNOISE> because he sees it and he's like <SIL> yeah they <IVER>
get it from us so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i know <VOCNOISE> exactly <SIL> right <VOCNOISE> i've seen some of the work from my husband's ninth and tenth graders because he's an english teacher <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i was appalled <SIL> because they were writing at like a fourth or fifth grade level and they're ninth and tenth graders <VOCNOISE> and i mean <CUTOFF-di=did?> <SIL> just <SIL> yknow even their manuscript and yknow just how they wrote and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-I> was like wow <LAUGH> i couldn't believe it <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> doesn't <VOCNOISE> that's a bunch of <CUTOFF-m=malarky?> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's just one of those myths <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i think that's <SIL> to make people feel guilty or something <IVER>
but it's not gonna work <VOCNOISE> i mean they <SIL> if you're around <SIL> people i mean number one they're around <VOCNOISE> their parents and their siblings and that's socialization <VOCNOISE> you go to <SIL> church or to the library or wherever i mean you're around people and you're around <SIL> children and they get to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> have socialization if you want to call it <SIL> whatever <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> from everything that i've read and seen <VOCNOISE> that um <SIL> they get <SIL> the socialization that they need at home and they're not relying so much on their peers and their peer's opinions <VOCNOISE> because <HES-I> <HES-I> for one example the pokemon craze <VOCNOISE> my son didn't know what pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it <VOCNOISE> and yknow it's just like stuff like that <VOCNOISE> it's just like they don't <SIL> they don't know what <VOCNOISE> half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face yknow <VOCNOISE> and then even still they're just like oh it's cool because everybody else likes it they don't really know what <SIL> it is or what <SIL> it's about or <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> <LAUGH> yknow what i mean because it's like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now they just blow up each other or whatever it's like really what is the point to the whole thing and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he didn't know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about it oh it must be cool because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it wasn't cool <VOCNOISE> so that was my <CUTOFF-influ=influence> our influence on him rather than the peer's influence on him <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> exactly <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> yeah <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it is and it's not <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> my house isn't as clean as i would like it to be but <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> but that's just one <VOCNOISE> minor <SIL> minor thing <VOCNOISE> and i feel like i'm just in a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> kind of a <HES-phase> phase if you will <VOCNOISE> it's yknow because they'll be grown up <SIL> in a blink of an eye <VOCNOISE> so if i <VOCNOISE> i mean if i put my career or whatever on hold <VOCNOISE> it's gonna be worth it in the long run <SIL> when my kids <SIL> are grown up <NOISE> <SIL> and they could be like yeah mom was there <VOCNOISE> they taught <SIL> yknow mom and dad taught us <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all of our life application skills that we need to know now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think that <SIL> that'll be better in the long run for them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that's the responsibility i took on as being a parent so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's my job <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> even though it is mundane and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> monotonous at <LAUGH-times> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <NOISE> <SIL> exactly <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh you're just you're just a <SIL> a homemaker <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
what do you do sit on the couch and watch tv and eat bon bons all day yknow it's kind of <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> exactly <VOCNOISE> that's the that's the idea that people get they don't <SIL> i don't think they realize <VOCNOISE> that how much <LAUGH-work> it is <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah and it's a challenge living on one income <SIL> <LAUGH> that's why i've got a part time job now <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> they're <LAUGH-confused> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> i don't know that staying home is for everyone and i don't think parenting <SIL> is for everyone <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it really makes me sad when i see somebody <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well we just want our 
kids <SIL> because they're only little once <SIL> that's what i tell myself when i get really really frustrated <VOCNOISE> they're only little once and they will be grown up before i know it <LAUGH-because> <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> yeah because i mean five years went by like <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah it was <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah because i don't have a degree <IVER>
i went back and did a one year <SIL> um schooling <HES-to> <SIL> get <HES-my> <VOCNOISE> nursing license i became an l p n <SIL> so <SIL> i don't have a degree my husband has a degree i put him <SIL> through school <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-I> <LAUGH-finished> <VOCNOISE> finished his private school <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
wittenberg <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
eventually <IVER>
yeah <SIL> we'll see where i'm at in five years <VOCNOISE> i know everybody is like well don't you want to go back for your r n i'm like <SIL> after working with r n's and <VOCNOISE> we were doing the same things basically and they didn't get paid much more than i did so i was like well what a waste yknow <VOCNOISE> go to school <VOCNOISE> for nothing basically just to learn a few more theories <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-I> <LAUGH-could> <LAUGH-come> <LAUGH-up> <LAUGH-with> <LAUGH-my> <LAUGH-own> <LAUGH> <IVER>
just <IVER>
a little bit of both i think i <VOCNOISE> looked into some phonics i went to the library checked out some phonic tapes let him watch those cause <VOCNOISE> kids love to watch things <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and just reading with him and going over things and <VOCNOISE> it's it's been amazing just to see it's like the light bulb comes on and <IVER>
yeah and he can sound out things and he can even spell things just from his own understanding of phonics and <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> i've i been pretty impressed i'm like wow you got that really really close to being the right spelling <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
just from what he's learned <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i mean most of it was me going over it with him <VOCNOISE> and just <SIL> yknow i talked to some people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and <SIL> yknow just <VOCNOISE> doing the things that work for him and as an individual <IVER>
i'd say we do oh at least an hour <SIL> or more a day <SIL> something like that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i mean i wouldn't <CUTOFF-se=say> i wouldn't say it was an hour at a time <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but yeah <SIL> and he loves playing on the computer <SIL> doing c d roms and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> loves watching the magic school bus <IVER>
so i <VOCNOISE> i try to gear what he watches <SIL> towards educational <SIL> programming instead of just <SIL> junk <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well right now i think he knows enough i'm just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things i'm pretty i'm like wow i can't even build the stuff that he built he makes ships and cars and <VOCNOISE> rockets an <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i'm <CUTOFF-a=I'm> i'm impressed i'm like ok i tried to build a car and it didn't look <LAUGH-like> <LAUGH-anything> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
ah <SIL> probably <IVER>
yeah <SIL> nah because right now yknow because he knows how <HES-to> he's he's learned <VOCNOISE> i'd say he knows more than most kindergarteners <VOCNOISE> so i don't even push anything we don't really have a set schedule right now and <VOCNOISE> i'm just letting him be creative and <VOCNOISE> yknow letting him help around the house and <SIL> yknow just <VOCNOISE> if i let him watch something thats educational <SIL> based usually <VOCNOISE> and i let him play on the computer <SIL> we'll go to different websites sometimes to <SIL> check out things and <VOCNOISE> i'm amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from <SIL> day to day <SIL> stuff <SIL> and just listening because he's <SIL> he listens to <LAUGH-everything> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he picks up toys he'll vacuum he <SIL> puts dishes in a dishwasher and <VOCNOISE> he can <VOCNOISE> um put clothes and take clothes out of a dryer and put clothes away <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
he cleans his <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he cleans the toilet too because he's a boy and boys <VOCNOISE> even some men don't quite <IVER>
hit the mark sometimes so <SIL> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-he> <LAUGH-gets> <LAUGH-to> <LAUGH-clean> <LAUGH-the> <LAUGH-toilet> especially since most of that is his <IVER>
<HES-or> <SIL> i would say ninety <SIL> nine ninety eight percent <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
because it's hard being the only girl in the <LAUGH-house> <LAUGH> <IVER>
his mom was june cleaver <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> and then they end up okay anyway <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's good <LAUGH> <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
he'd be lost <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
at the age of ten <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i shouldn't be having to clean quite as much as <LAUGH-I> do now <VOCNOISE> ah mm i'd say by ten <VOCNOISE> they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themself i know i did at then <VOCNOISE> and to be able to do <SIL> their laundry <SIL> maybe <SIL> definitely <VOCNOISE> help out a lot around the house <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no thanks <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE-you_decide_what_classes_were_gonna_be_taught_and_you_could_just_start_from_the_ground_up_like_you_don't_even_have_a_requirement_you_don't_even_have_to_teach_english_classes_if_you_don't_want_to_or_you_dont_have_to_teach_math_class> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't think i can answer that <IVER>
on the spur of the moment <VOCNOISE> i'd have to think about that i really would <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'd <IVER>
yeah i would <SIL> i'd say <CUTOFF-s=something> yknow life application <SIL> things would definitely <SIL> need to be part of it <VOCNOISE> i don't think that you should throw out english or math or <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> can't believe i'm saying this history but <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i don't think you should throw out that stuff but i don't think that there should be as much emphasis on it <VOCNOISE> i think more of the <CUTOFF-empham=emphasis> emphasis should be on <VOCNOISE> life skills and just being able to make it <SIL> on you're own and take care of yourself and <VOCNOISE> but definitely i think that those other <SIL> 
<SIL> the three r's <VOCNOISE> yknow i think those are still very important <IVER>
because you do have to have a higher education <SIL> most of the time to do anything <VOCNOISE> these days so <VOCNOISE> they definitely have to have their <IVER>
grounding at there so they can go forward <IVER>
i know i wish i knew how to sew <LAUGH> i can do buttons that's about it <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i'd say there would be certain life <SIL> application things that all kids should know <VOCNOISE> but not <VOCNOISE> i don't think that you can say everything <VOCNOISE> yknow you have <SIL> everybody has do this because <VOCNOISE> yknow people are individuals and you have to take that in to consideration i think so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
that's good <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> i'm sure it would happen because there's <SIL> <CUTOFF-p=people> all kinds of wacky people out there <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> seriously <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> i have the family members that are homosexual that's just my own personal <SIL> thing beliefs <SIL> i don't know i think that's <VOCNOISE> they shouldn't have taken it off of the <SIL> d m s <SIL> whatever it was <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
somewhat <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
so he's gonna be <HES-somebody> can complain about something <VOCNOISE> well that's another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook <VOCNOISE> yknow <EXT-everybody> <VOCNOISE> most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water <VOCNOISE> make some toast but <VOCNOISE> yknow that's about <SIL> all that they wanna do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody <VOCNOISE> not every female likes to cook yknow they just do it because <VOCNOISE> yknow they're supposed to or whatever and <VOCNOISE> i know some families where the men <SIL> the <CUTOFF-hu=head> the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all the cooking <VOCNOISE> and the wife does yknow whatever she does <VOCNOISE> i mean it <VOCNOISE> it's individuality <VOCNOISE> again <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah my dad's a chauvinist pig <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-but> <LAUGH-does> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-he> <LAUGH-still> is <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
no <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um probably not <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he thought it was great that i was going to school but <IVER>
but then he disowned me so it doesn't <LAUGH-matter> <LAUGH> <IVER>
mm <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
and i do have a brother <IVER>
by the way <IVER>
he didn't <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
he works in a factory <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well um <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-suppose> i suppose <LAUGH> well i've <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> decided that i was going to date a black guy and my <CUTOFF-hus=husband> my dad didn't like that at all so he disowned me and <SIL> so now <HES-he> i'm married to my husband and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> my husband is black <IVER>
and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
because not only is he a chauvinist pig but he's a bigot <LAUGH-too> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> a racist <EXT-yeah> so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
really <IVER>
i didn't know that <IVER>
okay <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> uh-huh <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> diversity <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah because it's the midwest yeah <IVER>
that's cool <IVER>
never <VOCNOISE> no <SIL> he doesn't have anything <SIL> he <CUTOFF-w_won't> he won't <SIL> talk to me <SIL> yet <IVER>
it is and it isn't because i <VOCNOISE> i <EXT-see> where he is and he's <SIL> really messed up and <SIL> i <SIL> i can't do anything for him <SIL> but i've yknow i've <VOCNOISE> i'm open to <SIL> a relationship with him 
but right now <VOCNOISE> with his attitude the way it is i'd say that <SIL> me and my family are better off not having him <VOCNOISE> stirring up a bunch of <VOCNOISE> conflict or whatever <IVER>
so <IVER>
<LAUGH> he's saw he's seen my oldest son when he was like two i was at my cousin's wedding <VOCNOISE> my cousin invited me to his wedding and me and my son went that was before me and my husband got married that's another long story <VOCNOISE> he was three when we got married <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> my <CUTOFF-hu=husband> <SIL> my dad threw fit <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> like a little kid <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> really he he didn't say anything to me but he made my aunt feel like a little <SIL> pile of dirt <VOCNOISE> his sister <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> so he just really <VOCNOISE> showed out that day <VOCNOISE> but what's so funny is <SIL> our baby <SIL> my dad has red hair <VOCNOISE> and our baby <SIL> has red hair <IVER>
<LAUGH> so and he <IVER>
and he looks uh he looks more yknow like <SIL> that side of the family <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i was <CUTOFF-ju=just> <SIL> he he was born we couldn't believe it we didn't know there was redheads on my husband's side of the family <VOCNOISE> and then we found out that he had a great grandfather with red hair and blue eyes <IVER>
that's my dad has red hair and blue eyes so <IVER>
it's just very comical i was just like uh-oh <IVER>
<NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i said well god has a sense of <LAUGH-humor> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-word_that's> what i said so <VOCNOISE> <EXT-I> don't think the saga's over <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>

right um <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> and it's sometimes that <EXT-opens> um <SIL> the person up because <VOCNOISE> a child they're so innocent and you can't help but love them <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i know my mom had a big problem <VOCNOISE> with <SIL> the whole inter racial <IVER>
thing at first but <SIL> she <SIL> my <CUTOFF-ki=kids> she loves my kids <VOCNOISE> and she loves my husband <IVER>
now <VOCNOISE> and it was just taking her out of her you know where she <VOCNOISE> yknow you you grow up hearing those lies and <IVER>
yknow it just experiencing <SIL> someone for who they are <VOCNOISE> and so she's <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh she's grown uh uh she yeah <SIL> she's expanded her horizons if you will <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>

and <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> just sometimes it's just like they're like oh well she couldn't understand or something like that but <VOCNOISE> for the most part i <VOCNOISE> there's <SIL> yknow no weirdness <VOCNOISE> he's had he had a few cousins yknow make some little <VOCNOISE> comments but <IVER>
no nothing i mean his mom and his dad are cool and <IVER>

my father moved here yes <IVER>
with my mother <SIL> um-hum <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my uh grandmother <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ill <IVER>
my mother's mother <VOCNOISE> and her sister <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> would be my aunt she was uh care taking <VOCNOISE> so my mother came here <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for that reason <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they just stayed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah they like they really like this town <SIL> she was from <SIL> kentucky <VOCNOISE> <SIL> appalachia <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he was from brooklyn <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i guess it worked for them <SIL> <IVER>
uh huh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
and not the <SIL> yknow <HES-all that went on in <SIL> yknow in new york the <SIL> fast pace <IVER>
yes i do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> about i try to visit at least uh <SIL> at least two every two years <SIL> we <VOCNOISE> <SIL> either we go to new york or we meet half way <SIL> <ERROR-kupwih=couple> years ago we met at penn state <SIL> and uh <SIL> so <SIL> yknow the older ones are all dying off though so <IVER>

i think that uh <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> yeah it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york <IVER>
<SIL> yes <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> well because my <SIL> cousins and uh <SIL> uh they all have uh <SIL> they're very <CUTOFF-w=well> <SIL> yknow well educated <SIL> they're more affluent <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and i think that uh <SIL> maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there <IVER>
uh he was a uh <SIL> railroad clerk <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he um traced freight whatever that means <IVER>
where the <SIL> where they were going and <SIL> and uh <SIL> he worked in a trailer <SIL> uh <SIL> out in the yards <SIL> yknow <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
he so uh <SIL> yeah he was strictly a union man <SIL> yknow <SIL> so <SIL> he kept his <VOCNOISE> he believed in the unions <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> so the railroaders was union yknow <IVER>
he always preached get a union job yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> course they don't believe in the unions now like they used to <IVER>
yknow <SIL> <HES-we> we really don't know much about his life away <CUTOFF-f=from> <SIL> yknow <SIL> away from home <IVER>
as far as what he did i <SIL> i'm sure that he probably did go to meetings <SIL> but uh as far as being a leader or something like that he i know i don't <SIL> i'm sure he wasn't <SIL> <IVER>
no <SIL> he didn't <SIL> he didn't <SIL> <IVER>
we didn't know <SIL> yknow anything about what he did or <SIL> we found out more um after he died <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> twenty years ago <IVER>
when he died <SIL> um <SIL> i was about thirty <IVER>
he was only fifty six <IVER>
uh he had an anorism <SIL> he had uh <SIL> high blood pressure <SIL> which we knew about <SIL> and uh <SIL> he started um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow not being himself so he went to the doctor and they <VOCNOISE> did some tests and found out he had this anorism that had to be operated on right away <VOCNOISE> and he died uh <SIL> under the anesthetic of a heart attack <SIL> um so <SIL> it was very sudden and <SIL> unexpected <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
no <IVER>
i ended up uh <SIL> running away from home <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
i was a teenage run away <IVER>
no there was a lot of conflict at home <SIL> um <SIL> my dad uh <SIL> had to support us uh there were four of us and our mother has disabilities <SIL> and uh she was kind of <SIL> crazy <IVER>
yknow not <SIL> that i'm <CUTOFF=st> talking negative about my mother <VOCNOISE> but she has um <SIL> some uh neurological damage <IVER>
and uh a disease <SIL> that affected her mind <SIL> and of course yknow back then i didn't really <SIL> know that but <SIL> there was a lot of conflict <IVER>
um <SIL> so uh <SIL> that's what i did and i <SIL> went to some uh <SIL> foster homes and things like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> lived in delaware for a while <SIL> yknow got out of highschool and <SIL> got married <IVER>
right <SIL> um-hum <SIL> i never went back home <IVER>
yeah i did <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> when i would run away from foster homes <IVER>
yeah i did <IVER>
that was that was horrible <IVER>
yeah there was a lot of them and they were not very good <IVER>
<SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah right here in columbus <SIL> in the short north <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> not too far from here <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<SIL> well that used to be where <SIL> yknow all the teenage teenagers went <IVER>
i don't know if they still do <SIL> that was a long time ago <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's always kind of been known for that <SIL> yknow <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they go <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah i don't know where they're going now but <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> i <SIL> tried <ERROR=voling> <SIL> volunteering <SIL> yknow at <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> picking them up <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> doing a volunteer thing and i'd get calls all during the night to go pick these kids up <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because i thought i was doing something to help but <SIL> yknow <SIL> you're not helping them <IVER>
this <CUTOFF-h=?> <IVER>
these <IVER>
this <SIL> these uh the <EXCLUDE-name> it has uh setup where um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they have safe places where kids can go when they run away 
<NOISE> <SIL> and then <SIL> it's different businesses like white castle <EXT-or> <SIL> pizza <SIL> one of the pizza places and <SIL> uh <SIL> some of the supermarkets and things and they're advertised yknow <SIL> throughout the community <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so these kids when they have problems they <SIL> might wanna go to huckleberry house and they don't have a way so they go to a safe house <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they call and they have a <SIL> yknow group of volunteers would go out and pick these kids up <VOCNOISE> take them to huckleberry house <SIL> which isn't far from here <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i did that for a while but uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> wasn't very uh <SIL> satisfying <SIL> because i really didn't feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at huckleberry house <IVER>
well they only keep them there like for yknow a day or so <SIL> and then they um <SIL> try to <SIL> intervene with their family <SIL> put them back with their family <SIL> or um <SIL> maybe call in children's sevices and i <SIL> and i just really don't think much of children's services so <IVER>
<SIL> yknow i just got out of it <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
no <SIL> <VOCNOISE> with the system <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes <SIL> uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-mo=most> uh yknow a lot of the <CUTOFF-fo=foster> yknow there's <SIL> people with good intentions but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i just think that it just needs to be restructured totally different way <SIL> and uh <SIL> yknow maybe pull these kids uh <SIL> into more of a group <SIL> setting or something and give them more um <SIL> yknow counseling uh professional <SIL> yknow counseling <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because it's um <SIL> yknow i i didn't have good experiences with <VOCNOISE> foster homes and <SIL> and i know of a lot of kids <SIL> yknow they're saying that <SIL> i think the parents have too many <SIL> rights <SIL> yknow in the courts <SIL> and there's just a lot going on yknow that <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> it's not gonna get better it's gonna get worse yknow with the way families are torn apart now <SIL> and uh <SIL> yknow <SIL> mothers have to work and <SIL> uh <SIL> you just can't yknow stay home and be that uh <SIL> yknow perfect mom <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> so there's just a lot going on <SIL> uh <SIL> that needs to be restructured <SIL> so <IVER>
the runaways <VOCNOISE> uh well <VOCNOISE> i think the youngest that i met was maybe <EXT-twelve> <VOCNOISE> but that's yknow still young <IVER>
i picked up one kid he <SIL> he had been in uh <SIL> he was only about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> fifteen <VOCNOISE> he was adopted <VOCNOISE> and he ran away <IVER>
he was having problems with his adopted mother <SIL> and he was in a <SIL> an all <UNKNOWN> <SIL> all night restaurant <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> and he was bragging yknow that he met this man <SIL> and the man took him home <SIL> yknow and he slept at the man's place <VOCNOISE> and i was telling her do you know how dangerous that yknow that could have been for you <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> he thought it was cool <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> so yknow just things like that <IVER>
he was lucky <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> he was lucky <NOISE> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> excuse me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> typically what i observed is conflict yknow with mom <SIL> most of the time <SIL> uh <SIL> well i think a lot of times when there's a stepfather involved yknow that becomes a problem for some of them <SIL> but <SIL> they said <SIL> yknow you might run into a case where yknow the family's abusing <SIL> uh <SIL> the child <SIL> yknow but i didn't run into that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
really <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah go in there and find out yknow is the kid being abused if the kids being abused <SIL> yknow take him out <SIL> yknow forget the parents rights <SIL> yknow <SIL> or um <SIL> yeah yknow if they're using drugs put them somewhere yknow <SIL> and get them yknow get them <SIL> in rehab yknow keep them there <SIL> yknow just don't <SIL> throw them there for three days and then throw them out <VOCNOISE> it's a lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes <SIL> where nothing's getting accomplished <IVER>
in a way yeah i think that would be good <SIL> yeah <SIL> maybe a new name <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah they had those back when i was a teen they wanted to send me to one of those <SIL> my father wouldn't allow it <SIL> because uh <SIL> it was <SIL> integrated <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
the court <IVER>
i had a social worker <SIL> um-hum <SIL> hum i had a social worker um <SIL> yknow the whole time <SIL> they might <SIL> yknow do things different now though but <VOCNOISE> you're supposed to have a caseworker <IVER>
i moved to louisville kentucky <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i had one <SIL> while i was there yeah <SIL> i have two kids <VOCNOISE> twenty nine and twenty two <SIL> they're real good <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> well my twenty nine year old she's married <SIL> and uh <SIL> she has a child <SIL> and she's <HES-expecting> she's expecting another one <VOCNOISE> she's a senior here at um <SIL> o s u <SIL> she'll be graduating <SIL> in june <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> she's worked yknow really hard <SIL> and my son he's uh <SIL> he's a senior he's twenty two he's a senior here <SIL> uh <SIL> don't think he's gonna graduate in two thousand <SIL> because he's a new senior <SIL> he wants to go to law school <SIL> he does uh real well in school <SIL> he's uh <SIL> like a honor honor honorary thing yknow <SIL> but that's all um <SIL> yknow on him he did it <SIL> yknow <IVER>
no <SIL> uh uh <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> not at all <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's always had very definite opinions of how his life should be <IVER>
okay <SIL> and always uh made choices for himself <SIL> but <SIL> as far as motivated uh for school no <SIL> he was always motivated toward a career <SIL> yeah he grew up here <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
yeah he went to columbus public schools well <SIL> yknow i or <SIL> i'm <VOCNOISE> catholic and i went <SIL> to catholic schools and so i tried that with both my kids catholic schools and um <SIL> for couple years and <SIL> so he was in uh catholic school a couple years but he got he got expelled <VOCNOISE> because he's uh <SIL> a d h d <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> okay <SIL> so <SIL> uh he got expelled from <VOCNOISE> catholic school for <SIL> behavior <SIL> problems <IVER>
no that's <IVER>
no that's one thing that uh yknow i found was really lacking here <SIL> um <SIL> for my son <SIL> uh <SIL> 
<SIL> nobody ever <SIL> yknow what they wanted me do was <SIL> put him on ritalin <SIL> and i didn't like him on ritalin i didn't like what it did to him <IVER>
uh it turned him into a zombie <IVER>
yeah i <IVER>
i mean i'm used to those uh boy like yknow <VOCNOISE> jumping all over the house and <IVER>
uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow just always just <SIL> active <SIL> and he's always been very active in sports <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but when i put him on the ritalin he was um <SIL> laying on the couch yknow just <SIL> zombied out <IVER>
<IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i didn't know yknow what the problem was and <SIL> yknow i just kept having these problems with him so they told me i need take him the school said i need take him psychiatrist psychologist <VOCNOISE> and uh so i took him and <SIL> she said do you think this is normal <SIL> yknow because he's like <VOCNOISE> rolling off the <EXT-chair> and <VOCNOISE> banging dolls together i <CUTOFF-s=said> i don't know i said i got one brother <SIL> i don't know how boys are supposed to be <SIL> she says well this is not normal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm like okay <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so uh i don't know i tried taking him to um <SIL> psychologists <SIL> they did like behavioral <VOCNOISE> therapy <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i brought him here to ohio state and put him in a <VOCNOISE> an experiment <SIL> uh he was in it for about three years <SIL> working with a food supplement <SIL> and uh <SIL> it actually did <SIL> real well for him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the researcher <EXT-gave> <EXT-me> what he yknow <CUTOFF-uh=it's> <HES-it's> like sort of like taking vitamins <VOCNOISE> he gave <EXT-me> supplies of that even <SIL> after the <SIL> project was over <VOCNOISE> but then after there wasn't any more he couldn't give it to me and it cost too much <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> for me to buy it <IVER>
i've never heard of it <SIL> being developed commercially <IVER>
so <SIL> uh <SIL> he finally decided uh <SIL> yknow after <SIL> oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his <SIL> <VOCNOISE> kept his <SIL> desk in the hallway <SIL> yknow <IVER>
yeah they'd just kick him to the hallway he was either <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> in the hallway or in <SIL> uh <SIL> the office and and the nuns would say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivia questions <IVER>
<NOISE> that was grade school <IVER>
yknow the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting into any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so when he uh was a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking i gotta get it together what am i gonna do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so he uh <SIL> agreed to go to psychiatrist and uh <SIL> so he went on ritalin <SIL> uh <SIL> so he took the ritalin through his <SIL> last <SIL> of his junior year and his senior year <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now he's on a medication they call uh wellbutrin <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> his doctor um <SIL> doesn't believe in <SIL> ritalin <IVER>
so <SIL> he gives him a drug called wellbutrin <SIL> which is a <SIL> yknow <SIL> like an antidepressant type thing that they said works for uh <SIL> a d h d <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but it really helped him yknow concentrate <SIL> to be able to <SIL> study <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
yeah he's got energy <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <SIL> i'm <SIL> saying that it's not right for some people but <SIL> yknow wasn't right for my son <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it is <NOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> because pediatricians are able to dispense it and <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i just <SIL> yknow felt like <SIL> trying to avoid it as much as possible yknow growing up <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> see that's that's the difference uh worthington has a <SIL> yknow program for them um <SIL> one of the women that i worked with <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she was having so many problems similar to mine <SIL> and her <CUTOFF-clipping=word>ch=child? son was in um columbus schools and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she moved to westerville and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> put him in this class for that and <SIL> it took care of it <IVER>
they don't have that <SIL> for <SIL> columbus schools <IVER>
i don't have a good opinion of <SIL> uh columbus schools <SIL> at all <SIL> no not at all <IVER>
no i i i don't think so <IVER>
well it's gotta come from the top <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i <UNKNOWN> i just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student <SIL> from every direction <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i would say yknow it's an organizational <SIL> problem with no yknow no motivation <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow to do their job <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow properly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now <SIL> i live down the street from what they call c.a.h.s. it's the columbus uh alternative <SIL> high school <SIL> and uh you get there through a lottery system <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they have the best reputation of all the columbus schools <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and uh those kids leave there getting full scholarships <VOCNOISE> uh my son went there one year <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was a disaster for him <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> but yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a very <CUTOFF-clipping=word>en=environment <SIL> and nonstructured environment <SIL> which <SIL> <VOCNOISE> my son wouldn't have worked <SIL> in and then they don't have sports but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> these kids get <SIL> scholarships to some of the major colleges throughout the united states and we're talking big money <CUTOFF-scholarsh=scholarships> full scholarships <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so if they're able to do it there at that one school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they could <IVER>
they could do it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <SIL> granddaughter my one granddaughter <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they live in springfield they just moved to springfield and she goes to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> kindergarten <SIL> only a half day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and this child is only uh five years old <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh he has them reading the newspaper <SIL> watching the news <SIL> she told me a story about <CUTOFF=col_columbus> christopher columbus um discovering america that was so <SIL> deep and intense <SIL> <VOCNOISE> couldn't believe it was coming from a five year old <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so this is what the teacher is doing down there <IVER>
and she wouldn't have learned that a whole day kindergarten here <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i would say in springfield yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i can't say yknow i cant say that it's an <CUTOFF-ex=expectation> <SIL> expectation <HES-word> i i still say it has to come from the top down <IVER>
uh <SIL> you've gotta have the leadership <SIL> uh you've gotta have the right people <SIL> uh <SIL> to have this <SIL> school structured <SIL> properly <SIL> and the yknow the people with the right credentials <SIL> uh for the job <SIL> yknow <SIL> and uh <SIL> i'm telling you <SIL> some of these principals <SIL> that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> that i've dealt with <NOISE> <SIL> uh were highly overpaid <SIL> as far as i was concerned for what they were doing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> yknow one <CUTOFF-gah=guy> <VOCNOISE> one principal that <SIL> from my um daughter's high school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he was out partying all the time they <SIL> yknow they <SIL> he was <CUTOFF-come=coming> he was riding around in a corvette <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh he tried to take me out <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and he was always like really red faced and the kids would say yknow he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and that was one of the better schools <SIL> in columbus <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> yknow i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of um <SIL> uh principals driving big fabulous cars and <IVER>
not doing anything <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <SIL> son uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow with his disorder <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he would constantly be uh <SIL> late <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> for school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i uh <SIL> called the school <SIL> and told them <SIL> this was in high school 
that i wanted them to file charges on him <SIL> and <SIL> they said well no uh <SIL> he's not <SIL> met the criteria <SIL> i said well he doesn't get to school sometimes until lunchtime <LAUGH> <SIL> they said well he gets here just <SIL> in time <SIL> to not be counted <SIL> um <SIL> tardy or not tardy but <IVER>
absent for the whole day <SIL> which would <CUTOFF-co=considered> be considered truant <SIL> so they said i well i had to do was go down to juvenile <SIL> to this certain gentleman <SIL> in juvenile and have him file charges <SIL> so i took my son down to him <SIL> and he said <SIL> it was the school <SIL> should have did that <VOCNOISE> so in the meantime he's telling me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that my son's in getting ready to go eleventh grade <SIL> and <SIL> neither side's gonna do anything about it <VOCNOISE> somebody should've did something about that because <SIL> then yknow they would have been doing what they were supposed to do to <SIL> make him <SIL> yknow <SIL> get in line <SIL> and uh <SIL> so he knew he could get by with it <IVER>
he <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> that's goes with the disorder they know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they know when <VOCNOISE> who's button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and <SIL> yknow where the line is and they <SIL> push you <SIL> always <SIL> that's why teachers <SIL> they uh they drive the teacher up the wall <IVER>
yknow my daughter yknow there was just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i'd call up to the school and <SIL> yknow the principal like <SIL> he's he'd say miss <EXCLUDE-name> yknow i'm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i am her <SIL> last chance <SIL> yknow <SIL> my daughter was going to summer school <SIL> every summer <SIL> and he's like mrs <EXCLUDE-name> yknow <VOCNOISE> she's like <SIL> yknow <SIL> the average student <SIL> uh <SIL> she's the type yknow that she's gonna get <SIL> yknow she's got gonna get through college yknow she's just one of those <SIL> yknow that just moves right along yknow she's not the brightest yknow but <VOCNOISE> she's bright enough and <VOCNOISE> those are your average professional people out working today <SIL> and i was just like well i just want more help for my daughter yknow i just want <VOCNOISE> somebody to <SIL> yknow jerk her down <IVER>

and uh <SIL> maybe that's why yknow it's like that but <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> historically yknow my dad's people <SIL> were democrats <SIL> but then they turned republican because they thought they were supposed to turn republican i guess <SIL> but uh <SIL> yknow there's there's some of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the conservative values that are very important to me yknow but then there's some social things that are real important too so <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> and some <SIL> conservative <VOCNOISE> <SIL> values too yknow that the republicans are supposed to <SIL> represent but i don't think they <SIL> they are doing a very good job of that <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>

<SIL> so they knew that this bush <SIL> name would bring out a lot of money <SIL> which it has <SIL> he's got a lot of money to work with <SIL> and yknow that doesn't seem fair either <SIL> i don't think yknow the average <SIL> person in <SIL> united states the average person <SIL> uh doesn't think that your politicians should be bought <SIL> yknow <IVER>

see i live close to <IVER>
<SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that would be the closest mall to me is northland <SIL> it's convenient for me <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then there's a lot <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow that they could do with that mall too <SIL> that <SIL> might make me even <CUTOFF-ga=gonna wanna go there more <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<SIL> yeah it's not like <VOCNOISE> there is a face behind like the music but not so much too yknow it's not like 
<VOCNOISE> uh like because there's not like <UNKNOWN> like a <VOCNOISE> a like a defined lead <VOCNOISE> lead person because just one person doing it most of the <VOCNOISE> most of time i mean like <VOCNOISE> people do <VOCNOISE> have groups that play like <SIL> techno beat <VOCNOISE> oriented music but it's not like <VOCNOISE> a lead singer who like <VOCNOISE> yknow is like that it's not like that at all <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i mean it's like <VOCNOISE> it's known but it's in a different way it's like a different type of fame than like <VOCNOISE> traditional style so <SIL> it's like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like <SIL> like it's more of like a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's not like an m t v <VOCNOISE> type thing yknow <IVER>
<SIL> like <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> it's like it's <VOCNOISE> it's really serious and it's really not serious like <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> it's everything i guess <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
just like there's a lot of different <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> like influences and everything <VOCNOISE> and like there's just a lot of places you can go with it <VOCNOISE> so it's real good <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah like <VOCNOISE> like sort of <VOCNOISE> i mean with like <VOCNOISE> m p threes and stuff <VOCNOISE> people do a lot of that <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> i don't <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i don't <VOCNOISE> i don't really go on the internet all that much <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah well like um <IVER>
like <IVER>
my dad like <IVER>
went <IVER>
to florida and i was with him there for a little while <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
then i <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> he moved to texas because like he was moving into like the he was going to s m u there <VOCNOISE> and like <VOCNOISE> so i moved <VOCNOISE> back <VOCNOISE> from florida back to up <VOCNOISE> up here because i didn't wanna i didn't wanna go with <UNKNOWN> because texas is terrible <VOCNOISE> and like <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> then like my mom <VOCNOISE> see like <VOCNOISE> my parents got divorced when i was like five or something <VOCNOISE> and so <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
i was living with my mom <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> like half and half like <VOCNOISE> joint custody or whatever i was living with my mom <VOCNOISE> half with my dad and then when my dad moved to florida i moved with him <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> uh my mom ended up <VOCNOISE> getting remarried and like my dad have remarried by that <VOCNOISE> time too <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> my mom <VOCNOISE> remarried <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> and they lived <VOCNOISE> moved out to sunbury and <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> this house on five acres or whatever and so <VOCNOISE> then <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> when i came back i just <VOCNOISE> lived with her <VOCNOISE> <SIL> up there <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> think when i was five <SIL> because it was like <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah i don't really <CUTOFF-re=remember> remember them being really together <IVER>
like <SIL> ever <SIL> but <SIL> i don't know it was real weird i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i don't know i mean <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i like florida just because it's not cold <VOCNOISE> and it's <VOCNOISE> it's really nice but it rains a lot i mean <VOCNOISE> and i <VOCNOISE> i mean i <SIL> i'd rather live out <VOCNOISE> west because it's like a dry heat as opposed to being <VOCNOISE> i mean it's nice that it's <SIL> ninety degrees but it's not nice that it's like ninety percent humidity i mean <VOCNOISE> that's kind of <UNKNOWN> kind of sucks but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> it's just different to live in florida and how you think of florida <VOCNOISE> being is real different like <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i like it because <VOCNOISE> kind of <VOCNOISE> the drivers aren't so insane like they are here <VOCNOISE> like people are a little bit more laid back just because like <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i know in parts it is really insane but like <SIL> sometimes just people would just like <VOCNOISE> because it's all <VOCNOISE> because it's nice weather people don't get so like aggravated by like here it's like cold and and grey and you just wanna like <VOCNOISE> yell at people in your car and stuff or something i don't know i don't know if people's deal is <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> yeah i don't know <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> i think it's like there's like a real like <SIL> either it's it's old people who are there <VOCNOISE> retiring or whatever <VOCNOISE> or it's <VOCNOISE> more of like a younger <SIL> people there <SIL> i don't know <SIL> you don't see a lot i don't know there is middle aged people there but it's not so apparent like <SIL> as here i guess <IVER>
yeah that's what it seems i mean <VOCNOISE> i know it's like <SIL> i mean it's the same proportions i mean there are more old people there but <VOCNOISE> just seems more apparent just because of how <VOCNOISE> but you can like go outside all the time <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean there's never <SIL> like three or four months where you just wanna <SIL> sit in your house and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i was in more north florida <VOCNOISE> around tallahassee <SIL> so that's a that's a little different i mean that's <SIL> that's <VOCNOISE> not <VOCNOISE> that's more southern georgia basically <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i don't know i mean <SIL> yeah it's not so touristy <SIL> and they had they had the thing where <VOCNOISE> you couldn't have any buildings bigger than the state capital because they didn't want it to be like orlando or miami like miami especially <VOCNOISE> so that was really interesting it was <VOCNOISE> a different type of town <VOCNOISE> like not not so many palm trees more big <VOCNOISE> oak trees and stuff like that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> it's real <SIL> it's more <SIL> not all of a centralized downtown it's more of a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like spreading out <IVER>
<IVER>
yeah <SIL> it's a lot smaller than columbus though <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> columbus is really interesting how it how it <CUTOFF-de=develops> develops compared to <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> i don't know just <SIL> like how <CUTOFF=Indianapolis> like how columbus is different <VOCNOISE> it is a <VOCNOISE> a real standard midwest city just how it's <VOCNOISE> designed and laid out compared to like philadelphia yknow or uh just <VOCNOISE> like when it was settled and and <SIL> when it was made <VOCNOISE> just how like <VOCNOISE> more of the streets are more it's all <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> planned out more as opposed to like in <VOCNOISE> in philly <VOCNOISE> or places like that more east coast it's like <SIL> the roads <VOCNOISE> parts of them are real small and like <VOCNOISE> and other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> so that's kind of interesting i mean <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> it's also odd like the urban sprawl of columbus how <VOCNOISE> it um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just the suburbs develop and how it's like more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized <SIL> area that's really big like our <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> columbus's downtown <VOCNOISE> it's really odd too <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> there's nothing to do down there <UNKNOWN> it's all <SIL> businesses and like the couple shops that are down there close at like six i mean there's like <SIL> couple restaurants or something <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i mean it's it's different when you think of other cities yknow it's more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it's like campus <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> or more of <HES-a> 
<VOCNOISE> like you hang out like <SIL> i don't know it's more of like a <CUTOFF-sub=suburban> like a suburban <SIL> town as opposed to like a centralized downtown <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> it's <SIL> just <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow like a half an hour or <SIL> uh <SIL> or i mean in <CUTOFF-twe=twenty> twenty minutes outside yknow you can get to dublin or fifteen minutes to dublin or something like that yknow i mean that's still like a part of <SIL> of columbus as opposed to <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> not really i mean <SIL> i go to <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> i go to this club axis sometimes <VOCNOISE> i mean that's short north whatever <VOCNOISE> like it's okay <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> i don't know i mean the red zone's downtown or whatever i don't go to that i really don't like that place but um <SIL> i don't know <SIL> uh <SIL> kind of the winter months really kill like doing anything like really any like foot traffic type things <VOCNOISE> i mean in the summer <VOCNOISE> it seems like it seems <VOCNOISE> in the winter it seems there's more <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> that like you have to do something like it's more of uh uh this big precession to do anything yknow you have to put on like <VOCNOISE> all of these coats where more in the summer you can just walk in and out of your house and like <SIL> go <UNKNOWN> go to the park and sit and it's fine but like <VOCNOISE> here yknow you get <SIL> slush everywhere and you got to think of so something to do you just can't like drive around and waste time because it's <VOCNOISE> because it's miserable <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>

yeah <VOCNOISE> harvey keitel <IVER>
that's what i was actually thinking of <VOCNOISE> um where he takes the pictures on the corner <IVER>
<CUTOFF-a=at> of at the same time everyday <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and only for like a <VOCNOISE> brief period <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
uh it's <IVER>
it's open twenty four hours so <VOCNOISE> there's people that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you know it's like shifts overlap you know it's not like everybody leaves and there everybody comes in you know <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's like <SIL> um <SIL> <NOISE> like when we're there like the night shift people start to come in people that work from like eight to four <CUTOFF-eigh=eight> <SIL> eight p m to four a m and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that be really weird <VOCNOISE> i guess like nobody calls then <SIL> or something like <SIL> ten people call so she's like it's easy she's like i get paid to <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she said that it's like i don't know some people who work there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> i couldn't imagine working <VOCNOISE> complete nights you know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i like working two thirty to eleven i <CUTOFF-th=think> i'd rather work like <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> maybe like noon to eight <SIL> that would be better because then it's like <VOCNOISE> i mean i'm more <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=staying> <VOCNOISE> toned to staying up late anyway just because of like <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> how it is or whatever but like <VOCNOISE> i don't want to have to get up really early either like i could never imagine having a nine to five job like that be horrible <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> have to go to bed so early <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
it's okay <IVER>
i don't know like i think <CUTOFF-hi=high> <SIL> i think uh high school in general like they i people always talk about raising the standards you know <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for high <VOCNOISE> <EXT-for> high school things but <SIL> um <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's kind of like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's really hard <VOCNOISE> to to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like i've thought about before just what's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> wrong with like the education system in general <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think it's more of a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> more of like a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> college is a little bit different i guess but it's more of like this whole like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the teacher <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the teacher's talking <VOCNOISE> and it like it like the information goes from like <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-profe=professer> <SIL> like the teacher's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh mouth to the student's notes with like out <CUTOFF-go=going> <CUTOFF-w=with> without going through either of their brains you know it's like just from like real monotonous and like you know dates and blah blah blah about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know just like <CUTOFF-re=real> it's it's a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's real structured but it's real hard to think about <SIL> what then what i could what to do to change that <VOCNOISE> it's kind of like more <SIL> <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i mean i had really good like there was a couple really good teachers like my history <CUTOFF-tea=teachers> teachers and english teachers were really good <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> just because <VOCNOISE> you know <SIL> it was more <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like <SIL> they seemed like they wanted to be there as opposed to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm just doing this <CUTOFF-f=for> because i don't know why or whatever and it seems like too <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they they <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i hate it when people <SIL> it's obvious that if they didn't have the textbook they wouldn't know how to do it <VOCNOISE> you know like where if people didn't have their notes like they wouldn't be able to do it themselves you know <VOCNOISE> it's kind of like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and so i think <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it's> it's <CUTOFF-i=it's> <SIL> that when people have real enthusiasm and like <CUTOFF-y=you_know> or and <SIL> put a lot of effort into making it not the same everyday not just like a lecture and when then we do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> homework and turn it in like you know it's like <VOCNOISE> we do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> like in history class we do like role <VOCNOISE> role playing things and like <IVER>
plays <UNKNOWN> like we like just things that are different and like <VOCNOISE> my sociology and psychology teacher were real good he did he was the same guy who taught history <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he was real good too like it was really crazy obviously but like <VOCNOISE> it's just like <VOCNOISE> interesting <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> like the sociology of high school and like having a sociology class about a <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well well it's sort of like the sociology of like cliques you know <VOCNOISE> like how <SIL> how that develops like <VOCNOISE> how people <VOCNOISE> like some people seek <VOCNOISE> to <SIL> like <SIL> fit in <SIL> like <SIL> like <CUTOFF-that=that's> that's a real strong uh <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> 
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-y=you_know> <CUTOFF-h=how> uh just how like too <VOCNOISE> how there's no real <SIL> <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> everybody conforms to their <SIL> own set of norms in each group yknow it's like <SIL> people <VOCNOISE> no matter like yknow even if ted kaczynski is out <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-oh> uh on <VOCNOISE> yknow wherever in like his little shed <VOCNOISE> yknow he's still a part of society like how you can't get <HES-away> from society and just how like <VOCNOISE> how society develops in general like how high school's like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> is kind of true to life but then really different too on how life is but just how <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just a <SIL> a more of a <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> more of a closeknit thing so it's more apparent how how segregation works or whatever <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> people that <CUTOFF-j=just> <SIL> just uh <VOCNOISE> really wanna teach as opposed to like i don't know why other people wanna <SIL> like <SIL> even went into teaching at all yknow <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> i think that would help just making it more like not so impersonal not so <VOCNOISE> this is <SIL> yknow you do this to get this certain grade it's like you do this to learn this because it's interesting as opposed to like <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i think it's like there's a lot of things that <VOCNOISE> it's more <VOCNOISE> like compulsory <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> education is weird <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> being forced to take this class like i think that if i uh but <CUTOFF-I> i mean it's good to being forced to take a <CUTOFF-bro=broad> like a liberal arts thing because like you don't know what you <CUTOFF-wa=want> <SIL> wanna do <VOCNOISE> so it's like if like you hate math and you don't take it at all but then you decide you wanna do something in math then you're like screwed like <VOCNOISE> can't go back <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> see i hate that like <VOCNOISE> all the work that you do is like reduced to like one letter <IVER>
and it's <CUTOFF-li=like> <CUTOFF-I> i like how <SIL> <VOCNOISE> see like i thought about going to antioch but it was it was really expensive and like <SIL> um i don't know <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> just because the <HES-and> and the school's <SIL> more of a <VOCNOISE> nontraditional <CUTOFF-ty=type> type where <NOISE> they give you <SIL> like evaluations and you don't get grades like and so <VOCNOISE> so then it <CUTOFF-l=like> <SIL> that's what that's what i heard it's like at antioch where the professor writes <VOCNOISE> uh like a couple page paper <VOCNOISE> on your <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> performance on the quarter and that that really shows that <VOCNOISE> i mean that's a lot of work for the professor but like <VOCNOISE> that really shows that he's really involved in noticing what you're doing as opposed to <VOCNOISE> just like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some kid in his class you <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
like <VOCNOISE> i'm not <CUTOFF-r=really> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm not really sure like how <VOCNOISE> they <SIL> how the interview works to become a teacher <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think it's like a lot of times <VOCNOISE> they're really desperate to find <EXCLUDE-people> <SIL> and so they really just <SIL> take whoever i mean <VOCNOISE> they're lucky enough to even <ERROR-f=have> have a body to fill the <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> place and they're doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean <SIL> sort of i mean <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-eh=I> i mean i <CUTOFF-g=guess> it's working well enough i guess i mean <LAUGH> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> like <SIL> people are learning things and like wanting to go on to college and stuff <IVER>
um <IVER>
i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> maybe <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> maybe if <VOCNOISE> teachers just their status in society isn't real high when it should be <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it's more <VOCNOISE> like i yknow i've heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers yknow and <VOCNOISE> how <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but it um <SIL> so it's just like <SIL> people always talk about yknow education for the <CUTOFF-ch=children> <VOCNOISE> yknow we gotta like <SIL> think about our child's future or whatever but <VOCNOISE> really teachers are <VOCNOISE> paid crap <LAUGH-and> like <SIL> don't really get a lot of respect from anybody <VOCNOISE> like professors and stuff get <CUTOFF-r=respect> <VOCNOISE> get <CUTOFF-r=respect> like <SIL> more of a respect but <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> it's just like <SIL> <ERROR-teat=teach> like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in <SIL> in your life like in <ERROR-chr=?> like especially in adolescence too like really influence like how you are as a person and like people don't <SIL> like take that for granted a lot <VOCNOISE> like if you have bad teachers in one subject you're gonna hate that subject <VOCNOISE> yknow and like if you have good teachers you're gonna love it i mean <VOCNOISE> that really <CUTOFF-in=influences> influences too like how <SIL> like what you wanna do with your life yknow <SIL> and people don't really <SIL> acknowledge that too much <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
<LAUGH> sometimes i think that it's just like math sucks and it's like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> so i started work when i was fourteen and i've been working ever since <VOCNOISE> i've been out of school since i was sixteen so i <VOCNOISE> i was in the service i was in vietnam <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh is there anything else you need to know or <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> well i used <IVER>
i used to fish and stuff like that but i've had skin cancer i've had four heart attacks <VOCNOISE> and if you look at my skin now you see all the blisters and stuff on <IVER>
i can't even go out in the sun that long <VOCNOISE> i've had melanoma cancer and stuff so i sold my boat <VOCNOISE> now mainly my hobby is uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just tinkering around and stuff fix <VOCNOISE> i'll buy a car fix it up and sell it <IVER>
or something like that just for something to do <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> trying to retire here from the university so i can get more hobbies <IVER>
well see i'm a limited on <VOCNOISE> some of the stuff i like to do i like to <VOCNOISE> well i'd like to go back and working with my hands and stuff i used to do maintenance uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> there ain't nothing i can't fix <IVER>
you know that's <SIL> not because <SIL> i'm skilled or anything it's because <SIL> well when i was a kid my dad was crippled i had to fix everything so <IVER>
yeah so <VOCNOISE> basically i learned with him <LAUGH-yelling_at_me> i heard do this do that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but ah <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> everybody in my family's mechanically inclined <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> she's disabled <VOCNOISE> uh she's got <VOCNOISE> she's in a car accident she's got what's called <ERROR-Myrofacial=Myofacial> pain syndrome or something <SIL> like that it's from <SIL> she had <ERROR-spiral=spinal> meningitis when she was a kid and it was brought on because of that and plus she's got a glass eye <IVER>
so she's very limited on <VOCNOISE> working in closed corners and stuff like that <VOCNOISE> uh so she's basically disabled <SIL> and that goes <VOCNOISE> when they do that it's because of your education and also they take into consideration and everything <IVER>
so she <ERROR-mas=basically> mainly stays at home <IVER>
she uh has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> with her eye or the car accident <IVER>
car accident i'd say about ten years ago <IVER>
no she lost her eye when she was six playing cowboys and indians with her brother <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she's a cowboy and he was an indian <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah it was a homemade bow and arrow <IVER>
which <VOCNOISE> every kid in the world plays with <IVER>
i'm sure you played with it too <IVER>
no <IVER>
well you always hear about the b b gun <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> basically last time i heard he was doing lawn care <VOCNOISE> he's done <VOCNOISE> about everything like i told him yknow <VOCNOISE> get as many jobs as you can until you figure out what you wanna do he's done uh <VOCNOISE> maintenance work he's done ah <VOCNOISE> sales work <VOCNOISE> i said he's doing lawn care now he's done uh gardening <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> his girl friend they've lived together he's not married <VOCNOISE> like i said he's got a kid now they've been together for about four years <VOCNOISE> but uh a lot times he'll work for her dad <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
now he does a lot of maintenance he was doing dry wall before this i kinda wish he stuck with that <IVER>
that's like twenty five or thirty an hour <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> the company wanted him to move to florida and he didn't wanna move <IVER>
so now he's back into lawn care until something else better comes along <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> don't bother me one bit <IVER>
no because i know people that are married don't take care their kids <IVER>
he takes care of his <SIL> so to me that's more important <IVER>
uh i was only there for couple weeks in the harbor <VOCNOISE> i never set foot on land <IVER>
no i was in the marines <SIL> but uh <VOCNOISE> basically all we did was just go back and forth <VOCNOISE> uh from like philippines to vietnam then from uh vietnam to hong kong from hong kong to vietnam <IVER>
uh we were floating around just <VOCNOISE> they didn't know if they were gonna send us in or not because it was toward the end of it <IVER>
i'm not that old yet <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_might_look_it> <IVER>
two years <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> i got thrown out of high school <IVER>
uh because i wasn't allowed to wear jeans i wasn't allowed to wear tennis shoes <IVER>
course everybody else could but <VOCNOISE> basically what it was uh <VOCNOISE> was a weird situation in high school <IVER>
uh it was for me and a couple other people and that was it <IVER>
and it's <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=if> <SIL> <HES-if> you know any <VOCNOISE-teenagers> the <CUTOFF-s=strict> <SIL> more strict you make it the more they rebel <IVER>
and i was <LAUGH-one_of_them> type of people <IVER>
i was a mean kid <IVER>
<EXCLUDE-name> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
uh yeah <VOCNOISE> they uh <VOCNOISE> got me one time for cutting zero period <VOCNOISE> and the principal was having me sit in the office during zero period to serve detention <SIL> so like if you can tell me how they can get me for cutting class when they ordered me to sit <SIL> in the <VOCNOISE> principal's office <VOCNOISE> i couldn't figure that one out too <IVER>
well at the time when they were having a lot of trouble at school and they just wanted to get rid of some people <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i was sixteen when i got out of high school and then i took my g e d at seventeen <SIL> and passed it plus was i went in marine corps at seventeen <IVER>
it was probably the best thing for me <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE-yeah> because i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well i met a lot more different cultures seen how a lot more different people live and found out how lucky i was <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> when you go over there and see people begging for can of beans <IVER>
and then you come here you know what i mean you see people standing out on street corners with signs work for food <IVER>
i feel like i should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting behind <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and people don't <IVER>
don't realize it <IVER>

to some extent yeah but to some extent no because see when i was in the service it was a different time <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well take for one thing <SIL> when i was overseas if we wanted to do something we'd wait till sergeant went the shed and we'd just put a padlock on the door so he couldn't get out <IVER>
and then we'd go do what we wanted to do <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yknow <SIL> because when you're overseas it's a different environment <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> people are more scared of you than you are of them <IVER>
<SIL> especially if you're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> waiting to go into combat <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> because you gotta trust the people you're around you don't <SIL> really wanna piss them off <IVER>
excuse me but you know what i mean <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and there's a lot of alcoholics in the military when i was in there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> most the time they're putting them in charge well like we'd get <VOCNOISE> no offense we'd get these college students coming out that were second lieutenants that thought they know everything <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and some of them did and some of them <SIL> were just complete idiots but you find that <VOCNOISE> anywhere <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> so you took your good for your bad <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i got a lot of respect for the college kids <SIL> majority of them it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> other people i don't have <LAUGH-respect> for <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> <IVER>
well like management here <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well like i'm getting ready to go through layoffs again where i work at <IVER>
but yet they got people we had no manager <SIL> say for three months <SIL> so course they took somebody that they were gonna lay off put them in a management position they're making eighty thousand dollars a year <IVER>
the can't see nothing wrong with that <IVER>
<SIL> but <SIL> yet they won't lay off people that actually <SIL> need the jobs <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the way the university here is run i can't agree with most stuff they do <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
like i said i've been here twenty five years i've seen a lot of weird stuff <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fact is was at baker i seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years <IVER>
yet paid <SIL> every week for doing nothing <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> it ain't gonna change though <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'm just an operator right now i've done production work too for them <IVER>
but basically i went back in operations because <SIL> it's not the money i like the job <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
just mount tapes uh <SIL> do printouts monitor systems uh <SIL> people have problems help solve them <IVER>
just different stuff it's different every day that's why i like it just like <SIL> you talking to people it's different every day <IVER>
and <SIL> i don't like sitting in an office <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh i did when i worked at the hospital i worked at the hospital here over here where i'm at <VOCNOISE> i don't but i'm in a big room like as big as a gymnasium <VOCNOISE> and i'm in there by myself <IVER>
which is kinda nice i can turn the radio on <IVER>
do whatever i want to some degree <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> depends on <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> who's the manager is the time every manager's got a different agenda on what's <SIL> they want you to do <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i thought it <SIL> was stupid <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they needed to strike don't get me wrong that's not the stupid part <VOCNOISE> but the part <EXT-was> uh <VOCNOISE> a majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and ain't making that much money most people would move on <IVER>
the university never has money that's like me when i <SIL> first came here the university was not paying me nothing i worked two <CUTOFF-yiyr=years> <VOCNOISE> or two jobs for ten years when i was here the first ten years just to make a living <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> i had the prerogative i coulda gone somewhere else and made more money <VOCNOISE> yknow but well what the bad part was is university's trying to do away with civil service <VOCNOISE> civil service is a good thing and a bad <SIL> thing <VOCNOISE> yknow you do <VOCNOISE> you had <VOCNOISE-step> raises and everything so it least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have nothing <IVER>
it's like where i work at <VOCNOISE> the only way i can get raise is by being <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> like the kids used to say a tattletale <SIL> squealer whatever you wanna call <IVER>
only way i can get a raise over there where work at <IVER>
to be a rat <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
and it's not <IVER>
and that's not right so i've always gotten two percent raises <SIL> even though <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> basically <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i been cross-trained or however you wanna say it i can work in three or four areas where most people can't <VOCNOISE> but i've seen people get ten percent raises <SIL> and i've seen me get two percent raise when i'm doing three jobs and they're doing one <IVER>
but it <VOCNOISE> i'm using me as example because i've seen a lot of other people do the same thing don't get me wrong <IVER>
but it just depends upon it still come back to who you know <IVER>
because they done away with the uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> civil service step raises which were wrong cause coulda done crummy job and got same raise as doing a good job don't get me wrong <VOCNOISE> but now <VOCNOISE> it is that you got <VOCNOISE> <SIL> people you don't even respect in management a lot of times giving the raises and they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> have no idea what you're even doing <IVER>
<CUTOFF-eyg=example?> <SIL> example that i asked my manager the other day she told me i was supposed to do this <VOCNOISE> certain thing and i asked her i said well <VOCNOISE> they told me i wasn't supposed to <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and she said she'd get back to me on it <SIL> well never heard nothing from her <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and she's done that to me i don't know how many times <IVER>
but yet that leaves the door open for who to get in trouble <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
makes her look good <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well <IVER>
it's just like your <CUTOFF-piy=people> people you see go to church that walk out of church see somebody sitting there that's homeless <IVER>
they'll ignore them won't they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because they're in their good sunday clothes <IVER>
well basically the same thing here <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> some of your management is real good i've seen people that <SIL> that <SIL> yknow are super <VOCNOISE> but i've seen people that are bad problem is you get a bad management <SIL> and it can make your life hell i don't care who you are <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> nice manager <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so yknow what i mean <SIL> i can outlast them <IVER>
and i do my job that's sometimes that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> basically hurts worse than <SIL> if you do your job and people know you do your job you got more people that'll stick up for you <VOCNOISE> without knowing it <IVER>
that's fine <IVER>
well <IVER>
let me ask you this <SIL> where the <SIL> where's the nearest teen club <SIL> there is none <SIL> where's the nearest playground there is none <SIL> where's the nearest sports center there is none <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <LAUGH-basically> there's not a whole lot to do except for the hanging out <VOCNOISE> so yeah i think society as a whole <UNKNOWN> more violent <VOCNOISE> the kids are more violent look at the news you see on tv every day you see people getting mad just <SIL> cause they're sitting in traffic <IVER>
that's adults <IVER>
see people <VOCNOISE> now all sudden there's a rash of fires <SIL> you read that in news people keep doing it <VOCNOISE> i think society as a whole <VOCNOISE> has gotten lot more violent which made the kids more violent <IVER>
i don't think it's the cartoons cause come on if they're that stupid <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean they they shouldn't even be out on the street i'm sorry <IVER>
cause that's like me i watch the three stooges and you don't see me put no crowbar up nobody's nose <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
<HES-you> <HES-you> <VOCNOISE> what it is is most people want don't want kids to live in reality <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> these kids that are violent <VOCNOISE> your whole society's violent i got <VOCNOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just got done helping my sister in law <VOCNOISE> that's an example right there she's got five kids <VOCNOISE> she's on welfare <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> her husband's <VOCNOISE> is <VOCNOISE> arab right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he's running an illegal business <VOCNOISE-here> <IVER>
the united states knows about it <VOCNOISE> they <CUTOFF-keh=can't?> <SIL> sit there and they'll pay the welfare <SIL> they won't do nothing to him <IVER>
now what's what kind of impression is <SIL> her kids getting <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
well he's uh <VOCNOISE> exporting cars illegally <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but he's also <VOCNOISE> like i said he's got five kids they live in low income housing they're collecting welfare <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> she just came here <SIL> and lived with me a year ago she could have her baby here <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so the state would pay for it <IVER>
so he wouldn't have to pay for it <IVER>
and she went back to him <IVER>
well i think the people that made that law should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs for more than two years and see how they like it <IVER>
cause there's some people that actually can't work <IVER>
my sister in law is one of them she is just <EXT-too> stupid <IVER>
she's got like a third grade education she's like a kid herself <IVER>
now people like that can't work when i was a kid <VOCNOISE> <SIL> your family took care of you there wasn't <SIL> the welfare and stuff <VOCNOISE> like this <VOCNOISE> but you don't have a family structure no more <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh you're in a high tech society and most people you said you're from new york right <SIL> your family's where <VOCNOISE> 
<IVER>
okay so how are you gonna help them when they're all over <IVER>
used to be you lived in a little neighborhood you knew all your neighbors you don't have that now everybody is mobile <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they <ERROR-st=just> had on the news most people keep the house five to seven years before they sell it and move on <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
same <IVER>
i've been in the same house for seventeen years <IVER>
and the only way i'd move is if the neighborhood went down and <VOCNOISE> when i say went down i'm talking about way down <SIL> i like where i'm at <IVER>
and i got good neighbors <LAUGH> <IVER>
i think that influences how everybody behaves not only the kids the adults too <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> well let's put it this way i can go out and make money without even making money off the government agencies if i wanted to if i wanted to be a crook i could <VOCNOISE> i could be a crook <SIL> and uh <LAUGH> i could have people rent me a house low income i could move in there <IVER>
i could do all kinds of stuff <VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
to make money on the side <VOCNOISE> all through the government <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's what i mean it it's too easy to get away with stuff nowadays <IVER>
well <IVER>
let's put this way if your kids are in my yard doing something and i yelled at them <VOCNOISE> you're liable to come down to my house and either shoot me sue me <VOCNOISE> or have me locked up right <IVER>
when i was a kid if <VOCNOISE> neighbor yelled at me <VOCNOISE> i better make damn sure he didn't tell my dad <IVER>
because i would've gotten my ass whipped <IVER>
nowadays you don't have that <IVER>
yknow what are you going to <VOCNOISE> you hit that kid <VOCNOISE> you're going to jail <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
well is it <IVER>
i had the same thing happen to my kid <HES-I> i smacked him one time <IVER>
yknow and it was in the butt going get me wrong <VOCNOISE> he told me he was gonna have me uh locked up for child abuse <SIL> so i threw his ass in the car and took him downtown <VOCNOISE> and took him inside <SIL> and told him to tell them people <SIL> because they're gonna lock him up <IVER>
if i'm an unfit parent not me <SIL> that put a stop to that right away <IVER>
uh about twelve <IVER>
because see i'm his stepfather <IVER>
and i've heard the thing yknow you're not my real father and all that we went through all that <IVER>
that's just like i told him <SIL> take everything you got that your real father got you <IVER>
and you can hit the road if you want <VOCNOISE> of course the only thing he had was nothing <IVER>
now i got him <IVER>
i got him sounds like i bought a dog <IVER>
but yknow what i mean when he was about nine years old but he's known me <SIL> all my life <SIL> so yknow what i mean it wasn't no big shock <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> but see his father lived right around corner and never even had nothing to do with him <IVER>
but when he did have something to do with him <VOCNOISE> it was kinda strange they would go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that <IVER>
and and yknow i was <SIL> here i am in a predicament i can't say nothing to them <IVER>
yknow <SIL> that's his real father so i gotta sit there and keep my mouth shut <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
none <VOCNOISE> whatsoever <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he'll <CUTOFF-basic=basically> yeah he'll basically tell you he don't have no except for me <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah but see that was coming from his <VOCNOISE-friends> more than him <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but of course whenever they needed a ride or anything like that they come to me <IVER>
yknow <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> it's just the same as when i was a kid <IVER>
it's whatever you gonna get away with <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah but fifty years ago if you had epilepsy they'd lock you in closet and throw away the key <VOCNOISE> and wouldn't let <VOCNOISE-you> out <VOCNOISE> most the parent i've seen <SIL> <HES-uh> to me i'd rather see the kids with a step parent <IVER>
because i've seen lot of bad parents <VOCNOISE> i've <CUTOFF-sh-seen> <SIL> seen a lotta bad people you know what i mean i <VOCNOISE> have <VOCNOISE-seen> <VOCNOISE> people <VOCNOISE> know you <VOCNOISE-always_hear> about drugs and all that <VOCNOISE> i've seen people sitting there drinking <IVER>
you ask where their <CUTOFF-ki=kids> i don't know he's outside somewhere <IVER>
now those people don't wanna take time nowadays it's easier just to give a kid a <SIL> beeper <IVER>
if you need them beep them <IVER>
then actually know where he's going <IVER>
every kid that my kid ran around with i knew his parents <SIL> one way or the other <IVER>
and yknow <VOCNOISE> i'd show up at their house if i thought something was going on know <SIL> yknow it don't matter to me i'm just <VOCNOISE> like said i <VOCNOISE> grew up here in columbus ohio i'm just a dumb hillbilly <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> like <CUTOFF-aw=?> <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> if they were having a party at somebody's house and their parents didn't know i'd <VOCNOISE-show> up <SIL> there asking what the hell was going on <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
<HES-and> <IVER>
no because them kids still stop at my house <IVER>
even though my kid is not there they'll stop by my house just to say hi <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and most kids don't do that nowadays <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
well <CUTOFF-al=also> <SIL> also too when is the last time you seen a baseball game <VOCNOISE> kids playing a baseball game in the neighborhood <IVER>
you don't <IVER>
<EXT-no> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
what's really weird is i can go over my mom's neighborhood <VOCNOISE> you'll still see kids playing out there in the school yard playing baseball <VOCNOISE> now i got a <SIL> school yard right next to me you come up there and you see no kids doing it <IVER>
<CUTOFF-sah=?> <SIL> it's like <SIL> each <SIL> neighborhood's got a little different <NOISE-personality> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think that's bullshit <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
my dad was crippled for <HES-uh> for nine months he was in a cast from his neck down to his ankles <IVER>
<HES-uh> he had <SIL> a hip fusion is what it was called back then they had no <SIL> artificial hips <VOCNOISE> he had one leg three inches shorter than the other and he had no hip joint <SIL> whatsoever it was just <IVER>
ground up bone <VOCNOISE> so my mom was working and uh <CUTOFF-f=?> <CUTOFF-ah=?> <VOCNOISE> this going to sound sickening <VOCNOISE> i was <VOCNOISE-twelve> years old i'd even have to come home from school and stick suppositories up him <IVER>
to take care of him i mean for twelve years old no offense <IVER>
when <VOCNOISE-that's_your> <LAUGH-dad_that's> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-that_ain't_the_best_place> to be <LAUGH-going_when_you_get_off_school_you_know> <IVER>
and <HES-uh> <SIL> it didn't hurt me none <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> i think it just depends upon like i said <VOCNOISE> a lot of factors know it's your neighborhood your neighbors <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> most kids don't have nothing to do in their neighborhood <VOCNOISE> even <SIL> and how many empty lots do you see nowadays <SIL> it still comes back to <VOCNOISE> like when i was a kid we had go carts we had mini bikes we had all that kind of stuff <IVER>
yknow <CUTOFF-ah=?> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> ain't no way in hell you have <NOISE-one> nowadays <IVER>
your kid be thrown in jail you'd be getting sued for not having insurance <IVER>
yknow <CUTOFF-it=it's?> <SIL> society again is taking away everything from you <IVER>
yes and no <VOCNOISE> uh when we were in boy scouts we got kicked out of it <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-so> <SIL> yknow what i mean we had more fun on our <EXT-own> <VOCNOISE> uh where i grew up i grew up <SIL> like i said right over here on olentangy there used to be a <SIL> pond over here at the cemetery we used to go <VOCNOISE-fishing> there everyday or <IVER>
this is in the summer now we'd go down to <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE-Olentangy> river to go <VOCNOISE-fishing> <UNKNOWN> over there where <HES-uh> <SIL> dodridge is <SIL> there used to be a bash recreation center with a miniature golf course and everything <IVER>
now what that's industrial nuclearonics or something like that <VOCNOISE> think about now you got the wetlands down there <SIL> yknow <NOISE> where are kids gonna go <IVER>
no <NOISE> not <SIL> like they used to <IVER>
the <CUTOFF-m=majority> majority are the ones that don't get the guidance <SIL> at home <SIL> that you're trying to reach ain't gonna go to boy scouts <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow> <IVER>
<HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> basically what you need more is <VOCNOISE> like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood <IVER>
where they can go everyday <SIL> the way i look at it <VOCNOISE> also <EXT-too> <HES-uh> <SIL> when i was a kid like i said i started working two jobs when i was fourteen you can't even find a job unless you're sixteen nowadays <IVER>
so it's kinda hard you know what i mean <CUTOFF-t=to> <SIL> to do a lotta things <IVER>
because <CUTOFF-they=they're> <CUTOFF-they=they're> they're saying you're still a kid but yet 
you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> can't do this you can't do that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah but i mean yknow <VOCNOISE> a <VOCNOISE-kid> that <SIL> you know might wanna save up for something when he's twelve years old has no chance at all getting a job <IVER>
yeah <HES-you> well we did that too <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
i got one sister <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah she lives over by uh riverside hospital <IVER>
about once a week <SIL> my wife sees her usually more than me <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yes> <IVER>
no my mom <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE-she's> not an invalid <VOCNOISE> uh she's seventy two years old but <SIL> they go out <SIL> usually to yard sales <SIL> stuff like that stuff i don't wanna do <IVER>
no offense <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well put this way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i was a kid <VOCNOISE> you didn't wanna be brought home by the police <VOCNOISE> you were actually scared of police <SIL> nowadays <CUTOFF-wh=what> what's kids scared of nothing <IVER>
ain't a damn thing they're scared of whenever we were kids we used to make zip guns <VOCNOISE> we'd take an ink pen <SIL> take the pen piece out put a firecracker in <IVER>
put so it fizzed and yknow you'd pack it full and you had a gun <IVER>
you know that the stuff like that's <SIL> always been around <VOCNOISE> but it seems now that <SIL> the guns are more <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you can get them easier <VOCNOISE> it's like me i could be carrying a gun right now what are they gonna do to me <IVER>
they ain't gonna lock me up <IVER>
carrying a concealed weapon they're gonna slap me on the arm <IVER>
now if i shoot you they might do <CUTOFF-sahm=something> i mean don't get me wrong i ain't <VOCNOISE> but i mean if i shoot you they might do something but otherwise than that they ain't gonna do nothing <IVER>
depends upon how i store it now <VOCNOISE> when i was a kid raised up we had gun locks on our guns even though i could pick them <SIL> i mean it <IVER>
gun locks are easy to pick you can break into anything <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but when i was a kid too we used go out turkey shoots and i'd go hunting all the time <VOCNOISE> so i was pretty familiar with guns <VOCNOISE> my kid uh he grew up he was familiar with guns <SIL> he also knew not to touch them <IVER>
if you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> but i had no pistols at my house i had shotguns and rifles <VOCNOISE> now to me a lot of these pistols like a twenty five caliber <SIL> come on there is no use for gun like that <IVER>
thirty eight derringer yknow <IVER>
the only time the use for guns like that is to carry to shoot somebody <VOCNOISE> when i <CUTOFF-w=worked?> <VOCNOISE> yeah when <IVER>
when i worked at bars i carried a gun constantly and <VOCNOISE> most the cops in neighborhood knew i carried a gun <IVER>
but they didn't say nothing to me because they knew the reason why <SIL> it's because i carried the bar receipts <VOCNOISE> now i could see to carrying one to that <SIL> degree but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there're <SIL> you know there's a limit you got all these people carrying guns because they'll tell you well it's the neighborhood i live in or you have women carrying guns even down here on campus <VOCNOISE> because they walk late at night <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> it's just <SIL> there we go again who's right who's wrong i have no idea <IVER>
and you even got these <SIL> the uh what stunt guns they're the ones that scare me <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> what <IVER>
them little electric shock things <IVER>
i got a bad heart i don't know what that'd do to me <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah but <VOCNOISE> guns are always gonna be around ain't gonna get rid of them <IVER>
but why would you make stricter gun laws when you can't even enforce your traffic laws <IVER>
yknow so basically <VOCNOISE> well yeah it might work but to me it's kinda stupid yknow because what you're saying is <VOCNOISE> we're gonna take this <VOCNOISE> law and <EXT-really> gonna stick you on this <VOCNOISE> law but the hell with all the other laws <SIL> so is that really fair <IVER>
i <IVER>
i've almost been hit i don't know how many times people talking on telephones i see people turning with no turn signals <IVER>
yknow just turn right out front of you <VOCNOISE> everybody's running red lights nowadays <VOCNOISE> mean which laws you gonna pick out to enforce and which laws ain't you <IVER>
uh <SIL> to me if you gonna enforce the gun laws and make them <SIL> stricter <VOCNOISE> what you ought to do is <SIL> put a limit <VOCNOISE> on the barrel length and stuff on guns you get caught with a gun <VOCNOISE> with a <CUTOFF-sg=?> <SIL> barrel smaller than uh <SIL> eight inches you go to jail <IVER>
no ands ifs or buts you go to jail for three years <IVER>
if you got an eight inch barrel on your gun now you tell me where are you gonna put it <IVER>
you isn't gonna get a lot of dates <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow> <IVER>
but <SIL> you understand what i'm saying it's <CUTOFF-k=?> <SIL> you gonna have to make <SIL> make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> you can carry a weapon here in columbus <SIL> i can carry a weapon right now as long as out the open <IVER>
course i'm gonna get stopped for suspicious person everywhere i go <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> yknow <HES-I> <HES-it's> still <SIL> the <SIL> it's constitution and stuff like that <VOCNOISE> yknow they always bring it back our forefathers did this and our forefathers did that <VOCNOISE> well our forefathers also <SIL> were squatters does that mean i can move into this room <IVER>
and tell you it's mine now <IVER>
come on yknow <VOCNOISE> people <VOCNOISE> i don't know i'd hate to be in a predicament of having to change anything <SIL> because be hard to change for one group and not another <IVER>
you know <VOCNOISE> so i don't know where to go <VOCNOISE> to me the biggest thing would be if they got rid of these saturday night special guns and stuff like that <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
you're <CUTOFF-s=still?> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-yih=you?> <SIL> yeah you always still gonna have violence like we were kids <VOCNOISE> like me and you would meet we'd get in a fight and after that we'd be best friends now <VOCNOISE> now i'd be walking down the street <VOCNOISE> hell fourteen year olds scare me to death right now <IVER>
not knowing they're gonna whip out a gun or not he ain't gonna go to jail <IVER>
and then they're gonna say they wanna nail their parents <SIL> yknow their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what their kid's doing <IVER>
the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so <SIL> you know what i mean basically all that <SIL> <SIL> all i've ever seen is <VOCNOISE> well like these kids that get in the house <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they go to the house they find a gun and they wanna hold the parents responsible <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yes and no on that <VOCNOISE> if the parents had the gun <SIL> in the house they had the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-uh> <VOCNOISE> ammunition locked up say in the trunk of their car <SIL> what if the kid bought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the gun <IVER>
so basically there's no way <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> you know unless you have a steel cabinet to put that gun in <VOCNOISE> and there we go <SIL> rich can afford that but the poor can't <IVER>
and most your people that <SIL> own guns that are <SIL> killing people are usually your poorer people <IVER>
most the <VOCNOISE-trouble> i have <SIL> uh i got one neighbor that hates me and he's a sheriff <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> otherwise no i don't have hardly any trouble with the kids i have more trouble with the parents <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
i don't <IVER>
no i don't fear none of the kids <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes to some degree they should but there we go again that's just like the people when i worked in bars <VOCNOISE> they'd always want to hold the <VOCNOISE-bartender> responsible <VOCNOISE> but say you could come up <SIL> i give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else <IVER>
but even though you're not responsible i'm the one supposed be responsible <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> people <SIL> yknow that have the beer party in the house <VOCNOISE> yeah <HES-they> they should be held responsible <SIL> to some degree but <SIL> we're in a society that loves to sue people <IVER>
yknow how far are they held responsible i don't know you'd have to go on a case by case basis <IVER>
on that <IVER>
well when <VOCNOISE> when i was growing up there wasn't as that much violence and i could go in indiana and i have done it now <VOCNOISE> my name ain't on this report so you can't do nothing about <IVER>
i picked eighty pounds of pot <SIL> one time growing along the railroad tracks and brought it back to columbus <SIL> eighty pounds <IVER>
<HES-it> it used to grow wild when i was <VOCNOISE-a> kid <IVER>
you could find it all over the place <IVER>
and you didn't <VOCNOISE-have> the violence and stuff like that i have never <EXT-heard> <SIL> and yknow i'm just using pot right now <IVER>
i've never heard anybody going on a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> shooting rampage that were high on pot most of them are sitting home waiting on a pizza <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> huh <SIL> and <SIL> it's just like cocaine and stuff like that you know your laws are different crack cocaine is one <SIL> powder cocaine is another <SIL> you know and <SIL> what they're saying <SIL> on that is that's <SIL> a <SIL> prejudice thing is what they are saying because they are saying more blacks <SIL> do <SIL> crack cocaine than powder cocaine <SIL> prison thing i'm sure you 
a pizza <IVER>
you know now <IVER>
i've seen more people violent on liquor <VOCNOISE> like said i worked in bars and i'm <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and i've <CUTOFF-s=seen> <VOCNOISE> it's just like cocaine and stuff like that you know your laws are different crack cocaine's one <VOCNOISE> the powder cocaine's another <VOCNOISE> you know and <VOCNOISE> what they're saying <CUTOFF-i=is> <SIL> on that is uh <VOCNOISE> that's a prejudice thing is what they're saying cause they're saying more blacks do <CUTOFF-k=cocaine> crack cocaine than powder cocaine cause of prison thing i'm sure you've read the papers <VOCNOISE> the way i look at it uh i've had four heart attacks every time i have a heart attack okay <SIL> they swear up and down i do cocaine <IVER>
which i've never done i don't want to <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> to me <SIL> some drugs should be legal <SIL> some drugs should be illegal <VOCNOISE> but to me <SIL> alcohol should be more illegal than half your drugs <IVER>
because i've seen more violence <SIL> on alcohol i've seen more women beat i've seen more kids beat <VOCNOISE> i've seen more drunken driving wrecks <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE-you've> seen people driving wrong way on the freeway right <IVER>
when they're drunk <VOCNOISE> when's the last time you read about somebody driving the wrong way on the freeway from smoking a joint <IVER>
<CUTOFF-guh=?> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<NOISE-or_either> that or they're so paranoid you know what i mean <NOISE-they're_more> worried about stopping <IVER>
and i'm just using that as an example you know what i mean your other drugs i don't know <SIL> much about them <IVER>
well they always did because first time i had one i was thirty six years old <IVER>
and whenever you have a heart attack anymore they always <CUTOFF-sus=suspect> suspect coke is the first thing <IVER>
because it stops your heart right away <IVER>
yeah <NOISE-that's> what i mean they go by your age too <IVER>
yeah and then when they <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah then when they did the blood test they found out i had hypertension plus <LAUGH-cardiovascular> disease <SIL> had nothing <LAUGH-do_with_drugs> <IVER>
not really you just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah it was painful but no worse than <VOCNOISE> going to the hospital for my back surgery my back surgery was worse than a heart attack ever was <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
uh i blew a <NOISE-disc> out <IVER>
and i couldn't walk at all <IVER>
so they <VOCNOISE> i have o s u insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they wouldn't admit me they told me they were going to <VOCNOISE> make wait two months before they did anything <VOCNOISE> and what i did i had my wife drive me down to the hospital i crawled out of the car crawled into the hospital and told them either admit me or i'd crawl out the door <IVER>
like i told ya i can be an idiot <IVER>
<NOISE-and> <IVER>
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the door as an o s u employee <IVER>
being turned away <IVER>
and for some reason they admitted me then <IVER>
i <NOISE-had> hypertension when i had the first two and then <HES-then> <HES-uh> the last two i had <VOCNOISE> now i got cardiovascular disease i still got one of my arteries <VOCNOISE> about eighty percent blocked i got another one fifty percent blocked and i got a dead spot on my heart right now so when i exercise <VOCNOISE> uh my heart slows down <SIL> let's put it this way where i work at i work here at o s u <IVER>
this will be something good to get on your tape <SIL> and they've got people over there where i work at <SIL> that they will <VOCNOISE> give them the days off if their cats are sick <IVER>
they'll also give them let them work seventy five percent if they're sick i had a heart attack had to come back to work early because i was out of sick leave <VOCNOISE> and like i said i've been here twenty five years and they would not even put me on first shift because they said it wasn't <SIL> a good enough reason <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
until i threatened to <VOCNOISE> sue them <IVER>
second and third i was working sixteen hour days a lot of times covering <SIL> that's one of the reasons they weren't going to move me <IVER>
well my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better <VOCNOISE> if i slept at night instead of staying up <IVER>
cause of your internal clock <IVER>
and i was trying to do everything and then also too they wanted me to go to therapy <IVER>
which was scheduled in the evenings i when was working and i couldn't even go to therapy <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
when i threatened to take them to court <SIL> and it took <SIL> almost two months <SIL> after that <IVER>
but i <VOCNOISE> i had a note in <SIL> before i had the heart attack <VOCNOISE> i'd already had two heart attacks i had a note in that i needed to be on first shift or i'd probably have another heart attack <VOCNOISE> and they would not put me on first shift then i had <VOCNOISE> another heart attack <VOCNOISE> put me in the hospital and then i had a <CUTOFF-h=heart another heart attack when i was in the hospital <VOCNOISE> and when i came out that's when i <SIL> gave them another note stating i needed to really be on first shift <IVER>
and that's when they said no <IVER>
it's <CUTOFF-a=all> <IVER>
it's all documented <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah told me to exercise which i do told me quit smoking which i been trying no offense it's harder to quit <IVER>
uh <IVER>
yeah stay away from salts uh sodium and stuff like that <VOCNOISE> pop uh coffee i don't have no problem there i don't drink coffee i drink a lot of pop though uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like pork products <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah because i don't like vegetables my hands are going to sleep <VOCNOISE> i don't like vegetables is what it is so it's real hard for me <IVER>
uh the exercise i do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> in the winter is when yknow i mean i don't exercise that much <IVER>
my bill collectors are the ones that scared of that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it's like this <VOCNOISE> what can i do <IVER>
<LAUGH-you_know_what_I_mean> <IVER>
yeah but you put up with that anywhere it's not just ohio state it'd be anywhere you go yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's just like i said <SIL> you get excuse me your assholes in <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE-and> they leave then you get <SIL> either another asshole or somebody good you just wait until you get somebody good <IVER>
it's like you're doing interviews <IVER>
you might think i'm <SIL> an idiot but you know what i mean the next person walks in the door might be real good <IVER>
but <IVER>
you understand what i mean <SIL> you just <IVER>
you just keep going that's part of life you pick up something you learn it and you keep going <IVER>
well i <SIL> i work with around mostly black people <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> it's a weird situation uh <VOCNOISE> they're more prejudiced <SIL> that i've noticed now than <VOCNOISE> when i only worked around a couple of them <IVER>
yeah because uh <VOCNOISE> they're more <VOCNOISE> you always hear about my black ass my <SIL> you know what i mean and stuff like this and i could give a shit <IVER>
you know what i mean it don't matter to me whether you're black or white it matters to me whether way you treat me <VOCNOISE> like when i first got out service is when they really started affirmative action i was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they couldn't hire me because of that was when they first come down with a mandate that they could only hire blacks <IVER>
so i was shut out of the job market then uh <VOCNOISE> that didn't even bother me i thought well fine <VOCNOISE> i went that's when i got the job at channel four <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> it's like anything else some blacks use it for good some blacks use it for bad <SIL> <IVER>
and if i was in the <LAUGH-same_situation> i'd be doing the same thing so <IVER>
you know what i mean <SIL> <IVER>
i'm a veteran so <VOCNOISE> i get points for veteran so you know what i mean <IVER>
everybody gets something <IVER>
you're a woman you're a minority <IVER>
<NOISE-so> right <NOISE-there> <SIL> you're over me <IVER>
my supervisor's black my last manager at the hospital was <SIL> black <VOCNOISE> plus my supervisor over there was black <VOCNOISE> my brother in law's black my other brother in law's arab my other brother in law's arab <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> let's see <SIL> the kids that i just kept <SIL> taking care of for my sister <SIL> in law <VOCNOISE> they're all arabs <SIL> <HES-uh> the three kids i had living with me two summers ago were all black <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> i did have a white kid my son living there and that's about it <IVER>
oh <CUTOFF-y=yeah> there's a lot of racism <IVER>
a whole lot <IVER>
<HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> your little <ERROR-clitchs=cliques> <VOCNOISE> cliques <VOCNOISE> it's like being back in high school <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
but 
<VOCNOISE> what's bad about where i work at <SIL> <EXT-it's> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not so much racism as <SIL> whereas <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you're my supervisor i'm just using as an example <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i do something wrong <SIL> <IVER>
they're going to come and ask you so no matter what you say <SIL> <IVER>
it's going be law <SIL> it ain't going come and get my story <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so that means <NOISE> <SIL> if you're working with me <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and you screwed something up <IVER>
<SIL> i'm the one that's eventually going get in trouble <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah but <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
well no they don't <IVER>
no i don't <SIL> see that kind of racism at all <SIL> <IVER>
basically uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's just <VOCNOISE> the talk and stuff it's not <SIL> uh <SIL> like <SIL> you know what i mean uh <SIL> i'm black i'm better or i'm white i'm better it's <CUTOFF-n=none> <SIL> it's none of that <SIL> <IVER>
no because like <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i work like i said my supervisor is a black woman <SIL> and i get along good with her the <SIL> the other woman that's an indian woman i get real along real good with her <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the other guy is a black guy i get along with him <SIL> real good with her <SIL> but my supervisor got a friend that's a black woman <SIL> that works in another department <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now she will come <SIL> and talk to her <SIL> and dump all her work onto <SIL> us <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
and then she's the one that i'll be hearing you know you don't know what they're like <UNKNOWN> black ass and all this you know they're prejudice <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and all she's doing is yelling <VOCNOISE> about being <SIL> <CUTOFF-pres=president> their prejudice against her <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what she don't understand that's her damn job <IVER>
<SIL> it ain't my job i'm doing her work <SIL> she ain't <SIL> <IVER>
but she's yelling at everybody's prejudice against her <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work <IVER>
yeah that's what i'm saying <IVER>
it's only a <CUTOFF-coup=couple> <SIL> yeah it's only a couple people it's not <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <ERROR-majoree=majority> of people i work around black like i said a majority of people i work around i get along with great <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> i could fire them because they're gay i could care less <SIL> <IVER>
the two girls that used to live across the street from me were gay they're still real good friends of mine live down in circleville <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> guy across the street is gay i worked in a gay bar one time <SIL> i was the only straight person in there every girl that walked in there <SIL> she'd come right to me <SIL> no <CUTOFF-offe=offence> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
because i wasn't gay <SIL> but you <CUTOFF-n=know> know what i mean i <SIL> could care less about gay people but like i said that <SIL> was the way i was raised <IVER>
<SIL> yeah my <SIL> my way that i was raised if people burned you once that's fine they burn you <SIL> twice get rid of them <SIL> <IVER>
you know it don't matter what they are <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there was gays probably when i was in there like i said i <SIL> could care less <SIL> but <SIL> i don't really know about how they should handle that because that's a weird situation <VOCNOISE> but you know what i mean just because somebody is gay <SIL> <LAUGH-they> ain't going to come after me they know i ain't <IVER>
<SIL> <LAUGH-no_offense> but you know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yknow that'd be like you know what the hell <CUTOFF-the=they> <CUTOFF-the=they> <SIL> putting on some kind of gay raise to make you gay <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<SIL> there is <SIL> <IVER>
do i <IVER>
uh <IVER>
well when they built the continent up on one sixty one it was almost all gay german village <VOCNOISE> was almost all gay at one time <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh yeah there <SIL> there was a big gay you got what about <SIL> twenty gay bars probably here in columbus alone <IVER>
<SIL> you know that i know of because you can look in the lantern or some of these newspapers we read a lot of newspapers at work <IVER>
<SIL> but uh <SIL> there lot of gays but like i said they're just like regular people <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> you know <IVER>
<SIL> i'm not really am sure how to answer that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i would say more conservative <IVER>
but i might be wrong because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my answer wouldn't be that good on that <SIL> question no offense but you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> yeah because like <SIL> i think columbus is more friendly than most places <IVER>
you know like when i was out in california it was like they'd spit on you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
i was working out there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well back then i was working at a cycle shop <SIL> but i was in the service but i was working there <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
well at tennessee they're even friendlier in some places <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
you hitting on me get the hell away <LAUGH> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
well see that's like my wife she said i would talk to the devil <SIL> <IVER>
you know <SIL> like i told her it's the way i was raised <IVER>
when i retire <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-uh> i'd like to move like to mount sterling or something like that <IVER>
i would like to stay right around columbus <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't like the way columbus is heading <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> for a big city don't get me wrong you can get anywhere real easy in this town <IVER>
but when i say i don't like the way it's heading <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they're cramming so many houses and everything and apartments and stuff <IVER>
it's getting <SIL> so congested it's that's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what i don't like <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah i had a boat and i got rid of it because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i will not even go up there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> go to hoover <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
what's really weird is <SIL> where i live at i live right by <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> right <SIL> i don't even have city water and sewer <SIL> i'm the only one on my side of the street <SIL> <IVER>
i'm the <SIL> only little one on my whole block <SIL> <IVER>
they're build two hundred thousand dollar houses <SIL> <LAUGH-everywhere> around me <IVER>
these people drive by look at my little house there in the middle of it all <SIL> <IVER>
with nobody around nothing but land <SIL> <IVER>
hey <IVER>
i don't know <SIL> that's the way i am <IVER>
well see that's like a big thing you don't understand when northland <SIL> shopping center closed down and all the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> where where i'm at <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they got so many of them strip malls like you're talking about with stores <SIL> <EXT-out> of them <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> you know and then easton you don't hear much about that anymore <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i've seen that <IVER>
<SIL> yes but there we go again you know that'd be better <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there used to be a place in upper arlington on zollinger road when i was a <SIL> kid <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it used to be called the arc <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you heard of the group the byrds right <SIL> <IVER>
they came and played there one time that was a <SIL> teen club <IVER>
like i said you have nothing like that for kids nowadays <IVER>
and at whetstone park they used to have shelter house in the summer they held teen dances <SIL> every <VOCNOISE> <SIL> weekend <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
and in the winter <VOCNOISE> they'd build big <EXT-bonfires> out there where the casting ponds was let you skate they have big bonfires <SIL> when you're done skating <IVER>
don't have nothing like that nowadays <VOCNOISE> somebody would fall through the ice and they'd sue them <IVER>
yeah but they don't have it <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> there ain't nothing else to do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well back when i was a kid they had battles of the bands at the mall <SIL> <IVER>
northland mall would host battle of the bands once a month <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> veterans' memorial would have it valleydale had uh <SIL> <EXT-battle> of the bands and stuff like that you know places where kids could go <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i just like because its smaller <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and i like the area it's pretty flat down there and plus see southern ohio's got a <CUTOFF-la=lot> lot of good places to fish <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> so that's <SIL> mainly it's probably more for <SIL> fishing <IVER>
<SIL> because i like johnstown <SIL> better <VOCNOISE> if you really want know but there isn't many places to fish up there well is that good enough 
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<IVER>
okay <IVER>
do you want to know where i was born <IVER>
alright i was born in boston <VOCNOISE> uh lived there <VOCNOISE> but <CUTOFF-bef=before> i moved away before i really even remember it moved to detroit <VOCNOISE> uh when i was there i spent <VOCNOISE> about ten years there then moved to ohio <VOCNOISE> uh with my family of course and then <SIL> right now <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i'm uh <VOCNOISE> at ashland university <VOCNOISE> but i'm thinking about <VOCNOISE> coming to o s u that's why i came down for the summer because i have friends down here so i'm taking a look at it <VOCNOISE> so basically <VOCNOISE> that's basically geographically where i've been <IVER>
uh yeah my parents live in akron <VOCNOISE> uh like north of akron cuyahoga falls area <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> like i said i my uh <SIL> i had apartment down there <VOCNOISE> but like for the summer i'm down here so <VOCNOISE> i'm a transient always moving my stuff <IVER>
uh-hum <IVER>
it's a real boring boring town <IVER>
i feel <IVER>
i feel like uh i have friends and when we say oh we're going out to the bar like we all know which bar because there is only one that college students go to and then <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
no no um <VOCNOISE> there's a few townie bars but college students aren't real welcome there <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
yeah basically for the entire summer <VOCNOISE> and then if i like it <VOCNOISE> ah <VOCNOISE> i'll be <VOCNOISE> i'll be enrolling <SIL> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no my roommates are i'm just my mom wanted me to but <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> uh the way it <ERROR-stems=stands> right now i'd just <NOISE> and rather work <VOCNOISE> earn money <IVER>
yeah well actually i uh do silk screening for t shirts for my <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> for <SIL> um <SIL> like on the side for myself like <VOCNOISE> to generate income <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> also <CUTOFF-afs=?> <VOCNOISE> as of <VOCNOISE> monday <SIL> uh i'm working <SIL> at ohio <EXCLUDE-name> it's an environmental group <VOCNOISE> i will <CUTOFF-d_ih=doing> <SIL> be doing canvassing type stuff just basically going door to door <VOCNOISE> sign this petition <IVER>
stuff like that <IVER>
yeah yeah it's uh <VOCNOISE> three hundred fifty a week <SIL> for forty hours <VOCNOISE> but i like the hours more than anything because it's two to ten <IVER>
so i can sleep in and <IVER>
yeah exactly in the middle of the afternoon yeah <IVER>
that's that's gonna be a problem they said bring bring water <VOCNOISE> you're gonna definitely like they have no dress code which is nice so i'm just gonna wear shorts <VOCNOISE> some good walking shoes and in a t shirt because <VOCNOISE> it could get rough <VOCNOISE> he could get real rough i bet <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um well <VOCNOISE> actually <VOCNOISE> i wanted to learn more about it i felt like <VOCNOISE> like i really <VOCNOISE> have no passion towards it but i thought this would be a good way to learn about it and maybe pick up <VOCNOISE> like uh <IVER>
some ideals <VOCNOISE> ideas about it so <VOCNOISE> i figure it's something i should know about so <LAUGH> <IVER>
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-Mar=Marion> <VOCNOISE> some elementary school i believe <VOCNOISE> or no <UNKNOWN> i think it's a high school in marion <VOCNOISE> was built on um <VOCNOISE> an old <VOCNOISE> weapons depot and so like leukemia has rise and <VOCNOISE> so like that's uh their main campaign now is to inform the public and <VOCNOISE> try and uh get that changed <VOCNOISE> they have also done other things ah <SIL> other uh they do anything <VOCNOISE> dealing with the environment <VOCNOISE> uh like <VOCNOISE> exposure <VOCNOISE> uh things like that so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it's for the entire state <VOCNOISE> and so this is just the columbus there is columbus toledo dayton <VOCNOISE> i don't know any others <IVER>
<LAUGH-no> no <VOCNOISE> not at all <VOCNOISE> there's not much in ashland <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> exactly <VOCNOISE> pass through it <VOCNOISE> random jobs for <IVER>
yeah like when i do the silkscreening in this is kind of random but <VOCNOISE> just anything <IVER>
that'd be great <LAUGH> i would do it definitely <IVER>
i'm living over on iuka <VOCNOISE> uh if you <SIL> on the other side of high street you know the mcdonalds right by high street it's like <IVER>
back there a block <VOCNOISE> so it's <SIL> right near <VOCNOISE> like lot of other student housing <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah i am just learning the area so <VOCNOISE> but i like it so far it seems really nice <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> ah it seems like there's a lot more to do in columbus obviously <VOCNOISE> but <IVER>
my mom teaches there <VOCNOISE> so it's free tuition i get a tuition waiver <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> and i figured i have a hundred <VOCNOISE> up to a hundred and fifty four credits <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> i'm to i'm up to like ninety four right now and i figured that would be a decent <VOCNOISE> i mean it translates over because we're on semesters <VOCNOISE> it will <SIL> get all messed up there but <SIL> <HES-it's> it's like <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> half way to three fourths done with uh with my degree so <VOCNOISE> if i wanted to transfer now would be like because i after this point if i stay any longer <VOCNOISE> a lot of the credits won't transfer over it would <VOCNOISE> be a waste of time <VOCNOISE> because most places don't like to take more than half <NOISE> so <VOCNOISE> that's why i just figure right now i should look <IVER>
yeah exactly exactly <IVER>
no it uh like i'm a business major and i hear the business school here is pretty good <VOCNOISE> so uh i wanted to take a look at that and my roommate is a business major so he he was going to show me around the they have new buildings i guess <VOCNOISE> so he said he would show me around there <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> also i <VOCNOISE> i really do like i came down for few games and things like that and <VOCNOISE> i like the enthusiasm that people have for this place like ashland is so small <VOCNOISE> there's a select group that has enthusiasm <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> nothing like here i mean this is <LAUGH-ridiculous> everyone is just enthusiastic about the university and <VOCNOISE> <HES-even> there might be things they don't like specifically about the university there uh <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> you don't hear <CUTOFF-m_eh=many> any <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> like universal negative things about this <VOCNOISE> about the university ever <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i hear <IVER>
yeah it's ridiculous i mean <VOCNOISE> plus its a nationally recognized school so a degree from ohio state <VOCNOISE> i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone's at least gonna recognize because it's big <VOCNOISE> it's big big name ashland it'd be more of a sell i'd be like okay we it's small it's private it's accredited <VOCNOISE> but still <IVER>
yeah it's really expensive but that's why i went there for now i wouldn't go there it was actually my last choice <VOCNOISE> uh for universities but i went there <VOCNOISE> because the price <LAUGH> <IVER>
it's in in education it's it's top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education <VOCNOISE> business school is coming up <VOCNOISE> like they're building a new building but by the i'll be gone by the time it's done if i decide to stay <VOCNOISE> so it's it'll be <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> as far as uh education like for small school and they just opened up their phd program in education <VOCNOISE> and they're also known for political science <VOCNOISE> but it's a real conservative political science <VOCNOISE> it's a real conservative school and that doesn't really match my <VOCNOISE> my views on a lot of things um like they it's dry <VOCNOISE> they have uh <VOCNOISE> real strict visitation policies things like that <VOCNOISE> my thought is if you're <VOCNOISE> if you're if you're considered an adult enough to move away then you shouldn't have <VOCNOISE> that many restrictions i can understand some because <VOCNOISE> i remember when i was a freshman in college it was <VOCNOISE> we did crazy things but still <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> very much so <IVER>
yeah it's a <VOCNOISE> you can if you're if <VOCNOISE> you can't go to a girls dorm <VOCNOISE> until <CUTOFF-m=maybe> <CUTOFF-m=maybe> i think maybe the afternoon <VOCNOISE> i think maybe eleven i'm not sure <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> but you have to be out by a certain time <VOCNOISE> uh it's not as bad as like malone like i don't know if you've heard about malone they have like certain days so it's not like that but <VOCNOISE> it's still just a pain <IVER>
you're allowed to have guests of the same sex like it <CUTOFF-s_eh=says> <CUTOFF-ih=it> like <VOCNOISE> i don't live in the dorms but assuming i did if i <CUTOFF-w_ah=want> if i had a girl come from home to visit me i'd have to <VOCNOISE> either sneak her in <LAUGH> and like just hope we didn't get caught or <VOCNOISE> have her stay at a friends <IVER>
like uh at a <VOCNOISE> girl friend's of mine <IVER>
a lot a lot of people <IVER>
yeah yeah <VOCNOISE> so it's kinda <UNKNOWN> and the university knows that's going on so <IVER>
they just <VOCNOISE> i'm not sure really what they do <IVER>
no this real like to live off campus <VOCNOISE> you have to well <VOCNOISE> after my class it'll be twenty two and senior credit status <VOCNOISE> but my class was twenty one <VOCNOISE> or senior <VOCNOISE> or senior credit so i got to move off campus <VOCNOISE> but like had i been a year younger i wouldn't have been able to because they have to wait until twenty two <VOCNOISE> so they're <IVER>
yeah you're not allowed <IVER>
no it's very much so <IVER>
very much so because there's two thousand undergraduates <VOCNOISE> and basically eighteen hundred of them live on campus <VOCNOISE> and then if you live off campus like <VOCNOISE> i'd like to think i don't have trouble making friends but like that <VOCNOISE> but i've had friends get arrested by the police because <VOCNOISE> after ten thirty like the university <VOCNOISE> there's they're vehicles they 
<VOCNOISE> of uh all the off campus <SIL> kids to like <VOCNOISE> to the police <VOCNOISE> and so like <VOCNOISE> they'd start driving around around ten thirty try and bust them for noise <VOCNOISE> on the weekends <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> it's pretty hectic <IVER>
yeah exactly that's what it's a very conservative town and the <IVER>
and it's a very <VOCNOISE> it seems to be a fairly conservative <VOCNOISE> uh <CUTOFF-u=university> <VOCNOISE> university as well so <IVER>
yeah i think if i make the transfer i'll definitely be happy about it <IVER>
definitely <IVER>
like <SIL> politically is that what <CUTOFF-ch=you> <VOCNOISE> oh well like um <VOCNOISE> like i was in high school i was involved in like the democratic <SIL> in the democratic campaign and <VOCNOISE> just stuff like that just <VOCNOISE> uh i'd like to do something <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> i <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> learning <LAUGH-more> about the environment because this job <VOCNOISE> but i'd like to do something <VOCNOISE> otherwise like a <VOCNOISE> a lot of like <VOCNOISE> business leaders <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> they're very <VOCNOISE> they become very conservative when they get higher up because like the tax breaks they wanna support things like that <VOCNOISE> but i think there should be a good mix <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> uh <CUTOFF-th=there> <SIL> there there could still be <VOCNOISE> like a think tank of <VOCNOISE> of executives that <SIL> could be very liberal and they're thinking and <VOCNOISE> just <VOCNOISE> you know for social <VOCNOISE> for social <VOCNOISE> not so much social change but <VOCNOISE> you know not <VOCNOISE> not um encouraging sweat shops within the corporations <ERROR-thu-=stuff> stuff like that and i'd like to <CUTOFF-ge=get> <VOCNOISE> i don't know how i would get involved in something like that but i would like to <VOCNOISE> it'd be interesting <IVER>
that would be neat <VOCNOISE> that'd be real neat <LAUGH> but <VOCNOISE> that's <SIL> dream world so <IVER>
i have to get a job and <VOCNOISE> support myself so <IVER>
that'll come later maybe when i retire <VOCNOISE> way <IVER>
way in the future <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i would like to think <VOCNOISE> i'd like to say no sitting here but you never know because <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-e=?> <VOCNOISE> i guess that's <CUTOFF-i=?> cause that's what happens to a lot of them yknow they <CUTOFF-beco=become> they come out of school all idealistic and then they go <VOCNOISE> into industry and then <VOCNOISE> they're molded and <VOCNOISE> assuming they make upper management <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-y=you> there's <VOCNOISE> you want the tax breaks you want <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-thing=things> <VOCNOISE> you know what i mean and then <VOCNOISE> they uh <VOCNOISE> like i have an uncle who's a vice president on wall street <VOCNOISE> for merrill lynch and <VOCNOISE> he said <VOCNOISE> you know he <VOCNOISE> he got out of school he was very idealistic but <VOCNOISE> now <VOCNOISE> he <VOCNOISE> he's <VOCNOISE> he's like all those people they should <SIL> you know i'd <CUTOFF-m=made> <VOCNOISE> i made it through myself and he's not for like the <VOCNOISE> you know but <VOCNOISE> realistically he didn't <VOCNOISE> but <IVER>
you lose sight of that i think <VOCNOISE> you know what i mean and <VOCNOISE> lot of these guys become real <VOCNOISE> egotistical <VOCNOISE> i mean i like my uncle and everything but <IVER>
you know you know what i mean <IVER>
no not at all <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> in the united states <VOCNOISE> it's the driving force of our <VOCNOISE> of our <SIL> of our government and <VOCNOISE> and even like <VOCNOISE> cause <CUTOFF-y=you> <VOCNOISE> without without <VOCNOISE> a revenue base from the taxes <VOCNOISE> of corporations <VOCNOISE> the you couldn't have nearly the things that we've had <VOCNOISE> and i think <VOCNOISE> to a degree they've become <VOCNOISE> fairly powerful but i don't think that's necessarily a bad thing <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> when the unions were really strong i thought <VOCNOISE> like we were <VOCNOISE> i was reading about it i thought <VOCNOISE> that was a good thing as well because that supported <CUTOFF-th=the> <VOCNOISE> supported the person but you could <VOCNOISE> if you have good relations with your labor <SIL> you don't necessarily need a union <IVER>
and a lot times unions <VOCNOISE> uh they <ERROR-akchisiy=actually> <VOCNOISE> actually seem detrimental <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> to production and <VOCNOISE> to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> the if the union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and <VOCNOISE> things like that and <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees <VOCNOISE> these lazy a lazy union as representative <SIL> of <VOCNOISE> of these workers so they're more apt outside <IVER>
yeah i was <CUTOFF-w=?> <VOCNOISE> i was driving by the <VOCNOISE> the honking and everything so yeah my roommates and i got into a <SIL> a debate about it <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> we didn't really resolve it <IVER>
because <NOISE> conceivably they wanted <VOCNOISE> uh what was it a two dollar raise <VOCNOISE> or something <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> and then they also get free tuition but only <VOCNOISE> as i understand it only <VOCNOISE> a very small percentage get that free tuition <VOCNOISE> or like <IVER>
exercise that <IVER>
that <CUTOFF-ri-right> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> like they all get the option but i <CUTOFF-f=feel> <VOCNOISE> i understand very few exercise it <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> you know if you were to not give them <SIL> the the tuition that they could <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> most of them are using and then give them the two dollars an hour <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> the but then <VOCNOISE> that could <VOCNOISE> then you could say that o s u's helping to keep people down and so you have to still <SIL> it's a it's an odd balance there <VOCNOISE> it is <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> uh it's something like that doesn't seem too skilled to me so the i don't really know why there's much of a union for that but <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> obviously the <IVER>
yeah it does it's not like a skilled profession to me i think <IVER>
yeah the protection <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
yeah there's no distinction <IVER>
oh they were helping out the the new <LAUGH-guys> <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> but he has to still support the union so <VOCNOISE> yeah that's <VOCNOISE> that's a rough place to be in <VOCNOISE> but a <VOCNOISE> does the union like when people go on strike does the union help support the people that aren't getting paid then or <IVER>
oh <IVER>
i see <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
really <IVER>
yeah yeah that's <NOISE> that's interesting <IVER>
really <IVER>
broke the <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> strike <VOCNOISE> if you're part of the union and you just decided to go back and say forget it <SIL> they can't pay you <VOCNOISE> yeah and i don't see too many people working for free <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> in general i <EXT-think> <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> the united states has <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a fairly well developed like class <VOCNOISE> not like <SIL> class structure in which you can't move up or down <VOCNOISE> but like <VOCNOISE> we have a <CUTOFF-f=fairly> <SIL> a fairly large middle class <IVER>
um sector and i think that's a good sign <VOCNOISE> but i think <VOCNOISE> there's <VOCNOISE> a huge there's <VOCNOISE> millions of children that don't have any healthcare and that's not right there's <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> there's a lot of <VOCNOISE> like between the lower and the upper there's a huge disparity <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> at least it's a step in the right direction we have a <VOCNOISE> a nice solid middle <ERROR-inclung=income> <SIL> middle <CUTOFF-inco=income> <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> middle income base i think <VOCNOISE> because a lot of countries only have the <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> i visited mexico and <VOCNOISE> seems like they only had the distinction between <VOCNOISE> the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small <VOCNOISE> and that uh but that economy is <VOCNOISE> coming along too and i mean it <VOCNOISE> it'll be <CUTOFF-f=?> <SIL> it's developing itself which is <VOCNOISE> which is nice i took a tour of <SIL> a plant down there <VOCNOISE> cause my my old <VOCNOISE> my old man had business down there so i went down <VOCNOISE> just to see it and <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> it it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better <VOCNOISE> granted those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> they get <CUTOFF-si=?> they get bused into work because <VOCNOISE> none of them have cars <VOCNOISE> and then on top of that <VOCNOISE> they all get a meal <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> there <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because <VOCNOISE> i was talking to the <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-m=manager> one of the managers and he said <VOCNOISE> if we don't do that <SIL> then <VOCNOISE> they won't be thinking about the <VOCNOISE> our quality <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> they'll be thinking about getting food and they'll be hungry so <SIL> it hurts our quality <VOCNOISE> so for them it was worth it and i <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'd like to see that implemented something like that in the united states that'd be a neat thing <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> i know like iron foundries and uh some like <VOCNOISE> like the lower paying jobs <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> they have people that are illiterate and things like that <VOCNOISE> and they can't <VOCNOISE> like give <VOCNOISE> paychecks out on thursdays because <SIL> everyone will call off on fridays cause they all go out and get drunk or <VOCNOISE> i don't know what they do with their pay checks i know that's a <EXT-big> big problem <IVER>
but like if you said i we'll have a bus service we'll go and pick you guys up <VOCNOISE> you know and then then you can't use the excuse my car broke down or something <VOCNOISE> and then like if you <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> even you give them a <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> doesn't even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you're on three shifts you can just <VOCNOISE> you know here's the box of donuts and some milk or something <VOCNOISE> you know that doesn't cost the company that much <CUTOFF-con=compared> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
compared to <VOCNOISE> you you'll have more loyalty i would think <SIL> and at the same time <VOCNOISE> those people won't be thinking about being hungry while they're on the line <VOCNOISE> working for you <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah exactly <VOCNOISE> you can bring that in house i think <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> i don't know i might go out like <VOCNOISE> like we said and <VOCNOISE> be <SIL> completely wrong <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
yeah 
<IVER>
yeah it's a qualitative type <CUTOFF-ah=analysis> <SIL> analysis <IVER>
exactly <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah they're very quantitative as opposed to like the quality <VOCNOISE> and then so <VOCNOISE> the analysis is all about bottom line and the numbers because <VOCNOISE> actually that's why i don't like <VOCNOISE> like i like business and i <VOCNOISE> i enjoy my business classes but <VOCNOISE> some of the people in my business classes i can not stand because they honestly they're like <VOCNOISE> oh it doesn't matter how you treat people and then <VOCNOISE> it's all about the bottom line well <SIL> they'll <CUTOFF-en=end> <VOCNOISE> in my <VOCNOISE-opinion> they'll end up losing more because <SIL> it costs a lot to hire a new employee <VOCNOISE> and if you have constant turnover things like <EXT-that> <VOCNOISE> then <SIL> and if you have a product and <SIL> that <SIL> because obviously people aren't gonna <EXT-care> <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> so <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> and they they're they seem very closed-minded like <VOCNOISE> like this is the way business has to <EXT-be> <VOCNOISE> but the professors don't seem to <SIL> be necessarily like that <VOCNOISE> maybe i'm coming too far <SIL> going to one extreme <IVER>
but the professors seem more <CUTOFF-center=centered> <SIL> centered to me they're like <VOCNOISE> you have to balance it which i'm sure is the truth <VOCNOISE> yknow you can't <VOCNOISE> diminish all your bottom line <HES-for> <SIL> yknow making your workers <NOISE-feel> good but <SIL> there's still something to it i think <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-exactly> <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> see i'm not sure if universal health <SIL> health care would be <CUTOFF-th=the> <VOCNOISE> <HES-the> <SIL> the thing <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <SIL> i think it was <VOCNOISE> my freshman year <VOCNOISE> my sister and i went to <VOCNOISE> donna shale the <HES-uh> <IVER>
the <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> whitehouse like <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-person> on <VOCNOISE> she's <VOCNOISE-pretty> high up i guess i was <CUTOFF-un=unaware> unaware <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> she she had a talk and my sister and i attended and <SIL> i don't like the problem i think with universal healthcare would be <VOCNOISE> everyone don't you think like everyone with the littlest scratch would go in <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-a=as> <SIL> as opposed <HES-to> <VOCNOISE> like the very <CUTOFF-mu=?> <SIL> and <CUTOFF-ne=that> i think that could drive costs up <VOCNOISE> so there has to be a way to balance it i'm not sure how you would go about doing that <VOCNOISE> because you don't wanna <VOCNOISE-put> a limit and say okay you <VOCNOISE-can> only go three times a year <IVER>
because then yknow what if something major happens that fourth time then what <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE-think> <SIL> i at least for children especially because they have no <EXT-means> <SIL> to to help themselves <VOCNOISE> and like <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE-parents> <SIL> obviously <SIL> even if they're working a lot of times can't get healthcare for their children <VOCNOISE> so i think <SIL> at least for children <VOCNOISE> because how many accidents happen to children like <SIL> people are always <SIL> breaking arms and stuff <IVER>
yknow and <VOCNOISE> without health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars <VOCNOISE> and they have no means to help themselves at least if you <VOCNOISE> assuming you're eighteen <VOCNOISE> you <VOCNOISE-could> get a job like <SIL> and try and <SIL> <VOCNOISE-pay> for your health insurance i mean it i'm not saying it'd be easy but still <IVER>
it's more feasible than <VOCNOISE> a six year old <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> so i think maybe <VOCNOISE> not universal health care but <SIL> for children i think it'd be helpful <IVER>
yeah <CUTOFF-exac=exactly> medicaid i think <SIL> i think <SIL> it <CUTOFF-i=it's> <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> they're always synonymous but <IVER>
but they're uh <SIL> because they're both government programs but yeah <SIL> but i <VOCNOISE-think> <SIL> like i said for the <VOCNOISE> for the younger people because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it is <SIL> <CUTOFF-ay=?> because it's not their fault their parents can't get <SIL> <VOCNOISE-health> <SIL> health care <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh really <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh i see <SIL> well that'd be a good way i would think <IVER>
yeah yeah then <CUTOFF-the=there> <LAUGH-there'd_be_no> desire yeah <IVER>
yeah that seems good <NOISE> <IVER>
that's cool <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah that's uh <SIL> the the bureaucracy <SIL> it'd be too much of a struggle i think <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah but if you're the first state in the union to do it <VOCNOISE> it <CUTOFF-co=cost> it'll cost you <EXT-millions> and millions it would be rough it be so hard to <IVER>
<NOISE> i know exactly <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you would <VOCNOISE-think> but <VOCNOISE> i don't know there has to be something like <EXT-why> you know the first state <CUTOFF-tha=that> <CUTOFF-do=does> that does it <VOCNOISE> i mean <CUTOFF-aa=I> i after <CUTOFF-f=?> one i'm sure others would follow suit <VOCNOISE> it after they see the <VOCNOISE-benefits> of it <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> that first one <SIL> i don't <EXT-know> <IVER>
and it would take <CUTOFF-f=?> like years i would think to implement the programs successfully <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> government doesn't seem to work too swiftly <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-no_not_that> not that i've seen <SIL> yknow <IVER>
<EXT-no> because <VOCNOISE> honestly like <VOCNOISE> gore to me is like a <VOCNOISE-best> out of a bad bunch <LAUGH-like> <SIL> if i have to choose i'll choose gore <VOCNOISE> but that doesn't mean i necessarily like <VOCNOISE> he's most in line with a lot of my <CUTOFF-stu=stuff> <SIL> with a lot of my views <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-no=now> don't get me wrong i'm not <VOCNOISE> completely liberal on everything like there's <VOCNOISE> certain things i guess maybe <VOCNOISE> because going to school in ashland it just rubs off on you <LAUGH-there's_certain_things_like> <VOCNOISE> i'm not so liberal about but <VOCNOISE> i don't really <SIL> like gore just seems so dry and just not <VOCNOISE> it's hard to <SIL> i <VOCNOISE-think> it'd be hard to get people enthusiastic for him <IVER>
no not at all i would've rather voted for <EXT-McCain> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> over bush <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> bush <SIL> <HES-he> <SIL> he comes from a political family which i'm not saying is wrong because the kennedys were a big <SIL> political family <VOCNOISE> but i'm saying like bush is um <VOCNOISE> he just seems like <SIL> he didn't really <SIL> like <CUTOFF-ih=?> everything's been handed to him in life <SIL> <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> the issue of like whether he did drugs not that that's a big issue but i don't like the way he addressed it <VOCNOISE> yknow that to me <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-just> <VOCNOISE> if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake <VOCNOISE> but the way he's handling it saying i'm not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over <VOCNOISE> if he didn't do it he might as well just be like no i didn't do it <IVER>
yknow because then what does he have to hide <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> like the fact that he didn't know <SIL> like i <VOCNOISE-think> in international policy he'll be struggling if he becomes president <VOCNOISE> he didn't know the <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-three> leaders of the world <VOCNOISE> thing and then on top of it like <VOCNOISE> texas is a fairly big economy but still like <VOCNOISE> to manage an entire yknow <SIL> an entire economy <IVER>
i <CUTOFF-th=think?> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and that <SIL> like <SIL> i <VOCNOISE-don't_know> <CUTOFF-tha=that> that state's notorious for killing people i think they killed someone last night <IVER>
<EXT-so> <VOCNOISE> that to me is <LAUGH-very> <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> that's ridiculous like the governor he could've made a stay or yknow what i mean <VOCNOISE> and they've openly admitted that they've killed people <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> were found to be innocent later <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and it's like number one in the union and that's like <VOCNOISE> such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone's life and be like <VOCNOISE> oh our bad <VOCNOISE> that person was innocent <VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
<CUTOFF-tha=that> <IVER>
definitely <VOCNOISE> i definitely <VOCNOISE> the way i feel <SIL> the death <VOCNOISE-penalty's> wrong <VOCNOISE> but <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE-people> are always like oh you know if your mother <CUTOFF-ih=if> if your mother was killed god forbid <VOCNOISE> but like you would want the death penalty but <VOCNOISE> honestly i don't think i would <VOCNOISE> i really like i'd feel angry towards that person but <VOCNOISE> killing them doesn't <VOCNOISE> help <EXT-me> <SIL> with <HES-my> maybe the families say it helps with closure and everything but <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-eh=?> that to me <HES-is> <VOCNOISE> it's displacing my anger in a way that <SIL> actually i don't think <VOCNOISE> <HES-the> <VOCNOISE> my victim that i was so close to me would want me to do <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well like <VOCNOISE> i'm a philosophy minor <HES-so> <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> if you look at like different <SIL> ethical theories and stuff <HES-like> <SIL> <CUTOFF-yo=you> <SIL> like there's a hierarchy kind of <VOCNOISE> this is what i've found <SIL> there's a hierarchy of <VOCNOISE> things that are <SIL> uh <SIL> like the inalienable rights for instance <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> i can't <SIL> if you come into my house <VOCNOISE> and rob me <SIL> and then run outside <SIL> <EXT-I'm> <NOISE-not_gonna> i <CUTOFF-don=don't> <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> to kill you for stealing my property <SIL> like there's a hierarchy there <VOCNOISE> uh for stealing another life that's why people say oh you can do it so <VOCNOISE> but i really feel like <VOCNOISE> there's nothing <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> if i if it's inalienable the definition is <VOCNOISE> it's not <SIL> able to be taken not even by yourself that's why you can't commit suicide <VOCNOISE> and since it's the highest thing because without it you can't even do the others <VOCNOISE> it's so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because <VOCNOISE> without that you can't do the <VOCNOISE> you can't be <SIL> ethical in any other <EXT-way> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> that has to be the highest thing <SIL> and if it's <SIL> inalienable because <SIL> i didn't give it to you <SIL> i can't take it back <VOCNOISE> you never <SIL> forfeited that <SIL> you never gave me that right <VOCNOISE> <EXT-so> <VOCNOISE> that's why i feel like <VOCNOISE> i could <EXT-never> <SIL> want that in <CUTOFF-a=?> <SIL> to kill another person or <CUTOFF-an=anything> <IVER>
well yeah <CUTOFF-uh=under> <SIL> under certain <CUTOFF-c=circumstances> <IVER>
yeah well <CUTOFF-it=it's> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh we took <HES-um> <SIL> uh i took <HES-uh> <SIL> military ethics <VOCNOISE> as a philosophy course <VOCNOISE> and that was really interesting because even though in <SIL> even in that hierarchy <VOCNOISE> there's still certain contexts within the context of war for instance <VOCNOISE> if <SIL> if we both <EXT-know> if we knowingly go into it as combatants <SIL> and <CUTOFF-we'r=we're> <SIL> we're fighting for <SIL> whatever cause but if we both <VOCNOISE> are willingly going into it 
<VOCNOISE> and we know that the result could be death <VOCNOISE> then <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> and it <VOCNOISE> and it's <VOCNOISE> an <ERROR-agressin=agression> <SIL> an aggression thing one side will be the aggressor one would <VOCNOISE> obviously <VOCNOISE> because you can't have two <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> two aggressive things <VOCNOISE> uh uh <VOCNOISE> naturally one would be aggressive <SIL> and then one would <VOCNOISE> be aggressive in it's response <VOCNOISE> you can't you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> so in like a state of war <SIL> it was like that so <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-m=?> <VOCNOISE> in that context i think <VOCNOISE> but like <SIL> in the same context <VOCNOISE> i feel it'd be wrong for a soldier to kill a civilian because <VOCNOISE> they didn't <VOCNOISE> um they didn't decide to become a combatant <VOCNOISE> so if you're an <VOCNOISE> if you're a combatant and you make that decision <VOCNOISE> or your drafted which <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> that is kind of like making the decision in the sense that you are part of that society that got you drafted <VOCNOISE> so if you choose to be part of that society <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> i mean that's a little shadier if <VOCNOISE> but still if you're <VOCNOISE> if you both make the <VOCNOISE> the desire to do it then <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> like if i were drafted i think i would fight i'm sure i would fight for the country or <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i don't think i would go <SIL> <EXT-like> you know <VOCNOISE> i just don't feel the need to go <VOCNOISE> on a <LAUGH-rampage_or_anything> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
well i mean <VOCNOISE> to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if <VOCNOISE> you're guilty or innocent <VOCNOISE> there to me there's <ERROR-worth=worse> <CUTOFF-thi=things> worse things <VOCNOISE> i would think than <VOCNOISE> than dying you know <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-y=you> you <VOCNOISE> like i know in israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin <VOCNOISE> he got locked up <SIL> and he's not allowed to see <CUTOFF-e=?> <SIL> uh because uh <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> under jewish law <VOCNOISE> you can't kill <IVER>
for that for <VOCNOISE> for that so <VOCNOISE> he he got locked up and he's not allowed to see another human being <IVER>
like they have this they have like <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> two doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and then he opens <VOCNOISE> and like <VOCNOISE> could you imagine <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> like <IVER>
no sunlight <VOCNOISE> you know <SIL> the and <CUTOFF-i=it> they don't give him they keep it warm <VOCNOISE> and he's not allowed sheets or razors <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> you know other than electric razors so he can't kill himself <VOCNOISE> so you're just stuck <CUTOFF-y=you> there's nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies <VOCNOISE> and that to me would be <VOCNOISE> like that to me is actually like <VOCNOISE> that has to be worse <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-like> <VOCNOISE> just the agony and the <VOCNOISE> and the i think you'd have to go insane like there's only so much you <VOCNOISE-can> <VOCNOISE> i'd ask for board games or something but like he <CUTOFF-ca=can't> <VOCNOISE> doesn't even hear a human voice <VOCNOISE> because <CUTOFF-wah=?> <VOCNOISE> i think it's something like that was written in the scriptures like <VOCNOISE> you're dead to the world for <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-i=is> <SIL> is the worse that you can do and so <VOCNOISE> the world <VOCNOISE> sees him <SIL> you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> so that'd be <EXT-rough> <SIL> that'd be real rough and <VOCNOISE> so obviously he would want to um <VOCNOISE> i would like they say like now like people that observe him he's like sings to himself and he <VOCNOISE> reads the bible like <SIL> everyday <VOCNOISE-and> <VOCNOISE> but like i don't know that'd be <EXT-strange> <VOCNOISE> be such a horrible thing to go through i couldn't imagine being locked in a room for <VOCNOISE-like> <VOCNOISE> few days <IVER>
like that <SIL> like solitary <VOCNOISE> but like unlimited solitary that <VOCNOISE-doesn't> seem right either but <IVER>
yeah like it's just <UNKNOWN> it's killing it's own citizens it's so <VOCNOISE-ridiculous> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah exactly <IVER>
if you just look at the nature of what they're doing it's just <IVER>
inherently wrong to me <IVER>
yeah exactly that'll <LAUGH-solve_the-problem> <IVER>
that's just it's ridiculous <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
you can get in huge arguments people like no you're lying because if your mother died or someone close to you died you would want them dead <VOCNOISE> and honestly <VOCNOISE> i can honestly say i would not want that to happen to them <IVER>
you know <IVER>
people can't <CUTOFF-understa=understand> <IVER>
they can't fathom that <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> they cannot understand where you're coming from <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah not not for special conditions <LAUGH-nothing> just universally it's wrong <IVER>
yeah that's what it is <VOCNOISE> it's a marketing thing <IVER>
maybe at the <VOCNOISE> under lying base <IVER>
<LAUGH> exactly <LAUGH> <IVER>
that's ridiculous it's like barbarism to me like <VOCNOISE> ugh <IVER>
yeah and we're <LAUGH-one_of_them> <LAUGH> texas is supporting strong they have like <IVER>
i forget they have the <VOCNOISE> like way more than like they dwarf any other state i think so <VOCNOISE> that to me is not <SIL> that's not admirable and then i <CUTOFF-wou=would> <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> so the <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-that's> one reason i wouldn't vote for bush <IVER>
<LAUGH> plus i don't really feel like the <VOCNOISE-republican_party_represents> <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE-populace> at a whole like at their <LAUGH-last> political convention like <VOCNOISE> in uh <VOCNOISE> the last presidential election in ninety six <VOCNOISE> they said one in ten of the delegates that were <SIL> attending the convention were millionaires <VOCNOISE> now granted i know more than ten people and not <CUTOFF-w=one> <VOCNOISE> you know what i <NOISE-mean> <NOISE> <NOISE-so_to_me_I> <NOISE> just feel <VOCNOISE-like> <NOISE> that's not a good representation <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
they <VOCNOISE> they definitely struggle <SIL> it <SIL> they do some <VOCNOISE> i i think <VOCNOISE> to be that high up <VOCNOISE> obviously <VOCNOISE> you're gonna come in contact with powerful <VOCNOISE-people_rich> people and <VOCNOISE> things like that but <VOCNOISE> i think at least even if the democrats <VOCNOISE> do have that same <VOCNOISE> thing they seem to keep more in mind <VOCNOISE-the> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i don't think they represent <VOCNOISE> working class <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> guy either but <VOCNOISE> at least more so than the <VOCNOISE-republicans> <VOCNOISE> so like i said best out of a bad bunch i'd probably <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_think> so <VOCNOISE> i think so <VOCNOISE> and like <VOCNOISE> they just <CUTOFF-d=don't?> neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity <VOCNOISE> me you know <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i have no idea i remember where i was too when the columbine shooting because like <VOCNOISE> my friends and i we're sitting around drinking a few <VOCNOISE-beers> and <VOCNOISE> you know we're channel surfing <VOCNOISE> and you know we see that kid fall out of the window and we're like oh my god what is going on so <SIL> we just left it on and <VOCNOISE> it was quite <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-eyz=?> like it was disturbing because <SIL> i <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> like i was recently out of high school myself and like sure there were fights and stuff <LAUGH-but_it_was_always> like you could avoid them or <VOCNOISE> know what i mean <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but now it seems like people are just <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> i don't know why that's a trend i mean <VOCNOISE> my dad said <VOCNOISE> uh he grew up in the bronx <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> he said even in the when he was in high school that they had <SIL> they had police officers there so that's not like a new thing <VOCNOISE> but he said <VOCNOISE> you'd have people with like knives and you'd have people with fist fights but you <SIL> like guns was unheard of <SIL> you know and i think <VOCNOISE> i don't know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh <VOCNOISE> they're <VOCNOISE> people feel dejected <VOCNOISE> in high school i'm sure of it <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> i don't i <CUTOFF-was=wasn't> i didn't feel that way <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i'd like <VOCNOISE> in retrospect i look back and i thought <SIL> you know i'm thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like <VOCNOISE> if every day was like <EXT-so> traumatizing to them <VOCNOISE> like that'd be so like for four years every day you're just like <EXT-teased> or <SIL> something like horrible and you <VOCNOISE> like no one talks to you <VOCNOISE> i'm not <VOCNOISE> justifying what they do at all <VOCNOISE> but i'm saying <VOCNOISE> that would make them more <SIL> that would probably in their mind give them the reason <IVER>
to say you know what i'm sick of this i'm gonna shoot those <VOCNOISE-people> <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i <IVER>
yeah i mean getting a gun doesn't <CUTOFF-se=seem> i mean i was surprised like <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> i would i've never owned a gun <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE-I'm> <VOCNOISE> i think it's pretty easy to get one <LAUGH-actually> <IVER>
yeah so <VOCNOISE> yeah and a lot people turn eighteen when they're in high school so <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-I'm> sure they can <VOCNOISE> go get one there <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's just ridiculous too <LAUGH-though> <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> yeah that's to me that's really weird <VOCNOISE> i don't like i said i don't know what they're <CUTOFF-thi=thinking> <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=the> what they're thinking <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE-or_what> their thought process was but <VOCNOISE> i'm thinking maybe <VOCNOISE> it the social because a lot <VOCNOISE> to me a high school is real social <IVER>
and like the social aspects of it were <VOCNOISE-the> problem <NOISE> so <IVER>
like i know uh like i was a <VOCNOISE> four year member of student council and like did that <CUTOFF-di=did> went that route in high school <VOCNOISE> and i know we always tried to involve other people <VOCNOISE> but like they would look at us and be like that's so lame i would never do it <IVER>
so like <VOCNOISE> it's like <VOCNOISE> you had these warring like <VOCNOISE> two different camps the <VOCNOISE> you know the camp that gets enthusiastic and <VOCNOISE> and that's where i was and then there's the other camp and i'm sure they have <VOCNOISE> their own <SIL> hierarchy their whole structure and like <VOCNOISE> you know they do things their way <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
while <CUTOFF-say=saying> while pooh-poohing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-as> <VOCNOISE> as far as bringing the two together like <VOCNOISE> socially <SIL> i think that's just a rough age <IVER>
you know because <CUTOFF-yi=you> <VOCNOISE> you're learning more about yourself <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> you're <CUTOFF-al=also> you're also learning more about <VOCNOISE> like you're <VOCNOISE-experiencing> a lot of freedoms that you didn't have obviously <SIL> you know <VOCNOISE> you're driving <VOCNOISE> 
<VOCNOISE> you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so <VOCNOISE> i really don't know how to how <SIL> how they would go about doing that perhaps <VOCNOISE> like i know we used to have like uh <VOCNOISE> we had <SIL> like the administrators actually allowed us to have <VOCNOISE> ah <SIL> a day where <VOCNOISE> everyone like the whole class <VOCNOISE> as <VOCNOISE-a> class could go have a picnic <VOCNOISE> like in the practice football field and that was cool because <VOCNOISE> everyone got along those days <VOCNOISE-because> you didn't have to go to class you know you spent the second half the day <VOCNOISE-just> <VOCNOISE> hanging out and so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start <SIL> you know <VOCNOISE> but then <VOCNOISE> that hurts <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-a=administration> <SIL> the administrators in a sense that <SIL> they're there to provide an <ERROR-edic=education> <SIL> education <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> it'd be rough <VOCNOISE> in like my high school <SIL> they <SIL> they put up <EXT-cameras> <VOCNOISE-and_they_had_like> <VOCNOISE> they locked <EXT-bathrooms> <VOCNOISE-like> at certain times you couldn't go in them and <VOCNOISE> like it was getting <SIL> and they had like we were on the front page the akron beacon journal <VOCNOISE> because they had a lock down where <VOCNOISE> no one was allowed to leave their classroom <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> they brought this <VOCNOISE> the dogs <EXT-through> <VOCNOISE-and> <VOCNOISE> they found <SIL> i was surprised they found a lot of drugs <IVER>
and <SIL> i wasn't real <VOCNOISE> i was more surprised that they found a lot of <CUTOFF-l=like> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-like> <SIL> alcohol like i wouldn't <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> you know like some people <VOCNOISE> if they do drugs at school and stuff <VOCNOISE> i'm not saying that's right but <VOCNOISE> they'll <VOCNOISE> they'll do it but like <SIL> alcohol it'd be so hard to like hide because it <LAUGH-smells> you know and you <LAUGH-gotta> hold it out but they found like bottles of <EXT-liquor> and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
stuff like that and i think they even might have found like one or two <VOCNOISE-guns> <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> and that to me was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but my high school is two thousand people so i guess <VOCNOISE> by sheer numbers <VOCNOISE> one or two persons would bring a gun <IVER>
um <SIL> it's considered <VOCNOISE> urban <VOCNOISE> but because it's north of akron we play <VOCNOISE-like> <VOCNOISE> a lot of like <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> inner city like in akron schools <VOCNOISE> but in my opinion it's suburbia <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> but we have the we have the big city problems like <VOCNOISE> there's a lot <UNKNOWN> drugs <SIL> and <CUTOFF-i=it> i think that's just because <VOCNOISE> the building's old so no one really takes pride <VOCNOISE-in> it <VOCNOISE> and then <SIL> it's two <VOCNOISE-thousand> people <IVER>
so that <VOCNOISE> like the just the sheer numbers of it i think <IVER>
i <CUTOFF-thi=think> i <HES-would> like if you had to ask i'd say i was a straight <CUTOFF-m=mid> mid western suburbanite <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> there are people that i go to school with <VOCNOISE> and ashland is twenty five thousand <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> in the city <IVER>
and they <VOCNOISE> they say that's a city <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> my school <VOCNOISE> or <CUTOFF-m=my> <VOCNOISE> where i grew up was <VOCNOISE> more than double that <SIL> just over double that it was like sixty thousand <IVER>
and <IVER>
cuyahoga falls <IVER>
and to me that's considered suburbia <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> and to me ashland is considered the sticks i mean <VOCNOISE> there's <CUTOFF-peop=people> there's amish buggies that go by <IVER>
but like to some people that's considered a city so i think it's you're perspective <VOCNOISE-in_that> sense <IVER>
for fun <VOCNOISE> we've been playing a lot of pool <IVER>
a <LAUGH-lot_of> pool <SIL> actually <VOCNOISE> uh we go to a bar <VOCNOISE> called the out-r-inn <SIL> because it's cheap and <SIL> it's fun there <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> out-r-inn <VOCNOISE> is over <VOCNOISE> i don't even know <LAUGH-like> <IVER>
<LAUGH> i know how to get to it like the way we walk but i don't know what street its on <IVER>
yeah it's real <CUTOFF-wa=walking> it's like the one of the closest bars and we go there because they have a huge patio <VOCNOISE> and so you can just sit out and <VOCNOISE> talk and <VOCNOISE> and then uh we play a lot of board games lately too <VOCNOISE> like we just bought axis and allies me and my roommates <IVER>
so it's really weird because uh <IVER>
it's it's kind of a fun game <SIL> it's just strange because <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> like <SIL> we're on <CUTOFF-se=semesters> <VOCNOISE> i came down in semesters so there was still a month <VOCNOISE> where everyone was down here <SIL> and now there's like <VOCNOISE> nobody down here so it's <VOCNOISE> myself <VOCNOISE> my two roommates and maybe <SIL> a handful of like <VOCNOISE> other people that we know <VOCNOISE> so it like <VOCNOISE> the social aspects like <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> has diminished a lot <VOCNOISE> but that still i mean for fun we uh <VOCNOISE> play a lot of video games do like i guess you'd think <ERROR-thike=like> the natural <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> things you would expect from a college guy <IVER>
go out <IVER>
try and hit on girls that doesn't work that type of <LAUGH-thing> <IVER>
yeah just get out there and have fun <VOCNOISE> and then like we lift <VOCNOISE> uh probably like four days a week i know i don't look like it but <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but i go with them and have a <VOCNOISE-good> time <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
yeah yeah it's uh right around here like <VOCNOISE-yeah> <IVER>
it's like down the hill kind of by the <CUTOFF-horsesh=horseshoe> <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah so that's where we go <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i don't have a student i d so i just sneak in but it's the summer they don't even care <VOCNOISE> they never <IVER>
i look like a college student that would go here so <VOCNOISE> i've never had a problem <VOCNOISE> so we go and <VOCNOISE-do> that <VOCNOISE> and like we're planning a road trip we're <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> we're not we haven't decided we're thinking atlantic city <VOCNOISE> or uh <SIL> florida <VOCNOISE> or new york city <SIL> <VOCNOISE-or> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-n=new> <SIL> new orleans those the choices we're trying to narrow it down <IVER>
i know <LAUGH-those_are> <EXT-hauls> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE-but> <SIL> you know <IVER>
when else <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ih=at> <CUTOFF-ih=at> <SIL> at this point in my life when else would i be able to do <VOCNOISE-it> so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
uh maybe <VOCNOISE> maybe i like i said like <VOCNOISE> it's really weird <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-em=most> most people make fun of me for still wearing detroit hats and being a detroit fan because i've lived in ohio for so long <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> when you're little is when <CUTOFF-yih=you> <VOCNOISE> i think you learn loyalty like i love the <SIL> old detroit tigers from the eighties <VOCNOISE> and like <VOCNOISE> that's when i learned <VOCNOISE> to like <IVER>
baseball like i collected baseball cards <VOCNOISE> i lived in detroit and so that's why it like stuck with me <VOCNOISE> so like i uh i remember when i had my tonsils out <SIL> in third grade like you're allowed to bring one item because like you're a little kid <VOCNOISE> to like make you feel better <VOCNOISE> and i brought my detroit tigers hat so <NOISE-like> <NOISE> <LAUGH-and_like> i i <CUTOFF-owul=only> like i'll only wear detroit or boston and boston just because i <CUTOFF-l=lived> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-I> uh was born there <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> and like people make fun of me they're like you know because detroit's horrible they're in last place <IVER>
they're like why don't you pitch <VOCNOISE> you know be happy for the indians i'm like i'm <VOCNOISE-happy> for them that's fine but <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
oh you get your <LAUGH-choice_kind_of> <SIL> well that's <IVER>
yeah yeah <LAUGH> equal distance <IVER>
<LAUGH> they're definitely <VOCNOISE> i thought they'd be a lot <VOCNOISE-better> <VOCNOISE> they got they picked up <VOCNOISE> ken griffey and then on top of it <VOCNOISE> they <CUTOFF-we=were> <CUTOFF-ha=had> they were good without him <VOCNOISE> and now they picked him up and they seem to be <CUTOFF-doi=doing> they still struggling i'm like <VOCNOISE> i don't understand that <SIL> yeah but the indians are horrible right now <SIL> i like i watched a game yesterday <VOCNOISE> and <NOISE> they were <CUTOFF-s=?> <VOCNOISE> i think they were few days ago seven and a half games back from the chicago whitesox <VOCNOISE> we watched the game yesterday and <VOCNOISE> i don't know if we have a lot of injuries or anything <VOCNOISE-because> i don't really follow the indians but <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-a=I> like i couldn't even recognize like that many of the names <IVER>
like <VOCNOISE> to me that was very strange <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> that's that's pretty much out there <IVER>
yeah they definitely have the sticks <VOCNOISE> definitely <SIL> yeah they <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> the big sticks are definitely <SIL> <VOCNOISE-on> those two teams <IVER>
it seems that way i don't know why that is <VOCNOISE> you know in the eighties <VOCNOISE> they had <VOCNOISE> a lot of games were like <VOCNOISE> one to two <SIL> you know <UNKNOWN> shut-outs stuff like that <VOCNOISE> now i mean <VOCNOISE> he <VOCNOISE> my roommate was telling me the yankees beat someone twenty one to something the other day <IVER>
and that's ridiculous <SIL> that's <LAUGH-amazing> to me <IVER>
i know yeah i know it's ridiculous i'm just <VOCNOISE> i find that just <VOCNOISE-crazy> <IVER>
yeah it dilutes <VOCNOISE> there's there's only so much talent so it dilutes it <IVER>
and that that makes sense <SIL> and a lot of the new ballparks are made smaller <VOCNOISE> so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts <VOCNOISE> people would rather see a <VOCNOISE> tight game that was like <VOCNOISE> seven to like six <VOCNOISE> rather than watch like uh <VOCNOISE> a two to one ball game <IVER>
because that's more boring <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah yeah exactly last three outs everyone's like yeah let's hope he does it but until then you're like <VOCNOISE> okay this is ridiculous <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
all right <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> no i think <LAUGH-I'm_all_right> <IVER>
<EXCLUDE-no_not_at_all> <NOISE> <IVER>

to be close so i didn't have to drive <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i'm a senior and i just started <SIL> <CUTOFF-the=the> <SIL> my art <SIL> major <SIL> in spring so i still have about four quarters left <VOCNOISE> but i am a senior <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

winter ninety one <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i went to columbus state <VOCNOISE> and i <SIL> had <SIL> just <SIL> there's a few years that i didn't go here <VOCNOISE> and then so i came back so <SIL> altogether i don't know how many years it's been but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
twenty <SIL> <CUTOFF-e=eight> <SIL> seven <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'll be twenty eight soon <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> august <VOCNOISE> it's pretty soon <SIL> i keep thinking i'm twenty eight now so it must be coming up <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> may as well just get used to it <LAUGH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
wow <IVER>
clintonville <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> no now <SIL> i live with my husband in grandview <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i've lived in all different parts of clintonville <SIL> but <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> except for a year and a half i lived in russia but <LAUGH> <SIL> that's <LAUGH-different> <LAUGH> <IVER>
wasn't really living <CUTOFF-ne=there?> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i was <SIL> actually serving a mission for my church <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> southern russia it's the <SIL> um near <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> khazakstan and <SIL> i mean not really near but <SIL> relatively it's not close to moscow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> it's russia <SIL> in the ural mountains no not <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't even know <LAUGH-where> that is that's pretty terrible but <SIL> i don't think it is <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i think it is further east than <SIL> where i was i was right in the ural mountains so it's like the <SIL> border of europe and asia <IVER>
um-hum it was pretty <LAUGH-far_out> <VOCNOISE> the city actually had a million people <CUTOFF-in> that i lived in most of the time <VOCNOISE> but it was <VOCNOISE> the government that ran it actually was still <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> communist <SIL> <IVER>
they weren't they're not really <SIL> acting <SIL> they are the government there <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> they <CUTOFF-s=still?> <SIL> it's just all so messed up it doesn't really matter who's <IVER>
the <LAUGH-government> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> it's whoever wants to <LAUGH-be> <IVER>
um it was just <SIL> yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem <SIL> they just take over everything and they <SIL> they don't pay their workers and <VOCNOISE> most people aren't mafia so they <SIL> don't get paid <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah this was <CUTOFF-a=about> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> three years ago <VOCNOISE> about three years ago in august it'll be three <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> yeah it was <VOCNOISE> however many <VOCNOISE> was that in eighty nine or ninety or something like that <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> it gets more and more <SIL> um <SIL> like <CUTOFF-A=America> <SIL> it's not like america <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> more and more like a <CUTOFF-r=regular> <SIL> regular democracy every year <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> not really but <SIL> it's closer and closer <LAUGH> <SIL> a little bit <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it <CUTOFF-w=wasn't> <SIL> it wasn't easy <SIL> and <SIL> at first it was probably a lot harder <VOCNOISE> then after you've been there <SIL> for about six months and you start to just get used to things <SIL> but <SIL> i <SIL> i took for granted <SIL> coming to <CUTOFF-ameri=america> coming back here was <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it was so amazing to be <SIL> back in <LAUGH-America> <LAUGH> <IVER>
seeing all the <SIL> nice things just <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-e=everywhere> <SIL> <CUTOFF-e=everywhere> <SIL> everywhere it's just <SIL> i couldn't believe it <VOCNOISE> but now it's <HES-it's> easy to take it for granted again just <VOCNOISE> oh i'm back home <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well i was <SIL> with <SIL> um <SIL> i'm <SIL> <VOCNOISE> mormon so <VOCNOISE> we i don't know if you have ever seen how <SIL> they go two by two always and <VOCNOISE> i was with what we call another sister i was <SIL> and we would live in an apartment <SIL> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> would pay for our own mission and <VOCNOISE> there was a mission president <SIL> and they had different people <SIL> with responsibilities <SIL> leaders and <VOCNOISE> they would watch over you and make sure yknow call in the <SIL> every night and check on you but <SIL> it was really <VOCNOISE> up to us what we wanted to do we were <VOCNOISE> we'd get up <SIL> leave at nine thirty and <SIL> be home by <SIL> nine thirty or whenever it got dark <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> we could do <SIL> what we wanted <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i mean we had goals certain things that <SIL> like we <SIL> we had a set <SIL> where we'd like to do four hours of service every week <IVER>
we'd <SIL> like teach <VOCNOISE> english to little kids or <SIL> or help clean or <SIL> work at libraries or <SIL> different things <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh wow <IVER>
oh did you really <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
it might have been where the president lived <VOCNOISE> they sometimes have like a mission home <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
especially the guys <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
just <IVER>
yeah we had um <SIL> any <SIL> not really just <SIL> modest dresses you couldn't wear pants <VOCNOISE> and it <CUTOFF-wou=would> <VOCNOISE> dresses couldn't be ankle length <VOCNOISE> they couldn't be <SIL> um at the knee <SIL> had to be mid <CUTOFF-ca=calf> mid <CUTOFF-kn=knee> <SIL> mid <SIL> knee <SIL> or whatever that is calf <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> certain restrictions but yeah i mean basically just modest <NOISE> whatever <SIL> i mean i wear <SIL> boots with a dress in <LAUGH-Russia_but> <IVER>
i don't think you'd do that here <LAUGH> <IVER>
i think so yeah like their haircuts are a certain way and <VOCNOISE> can't <SIL> you have to shave and <VOCNOISE> um you always have to have your tie <SIL> and <SIL> your jacket if you can <SIL> unless it's really hot <SIL> there's <CUTOFF-di=different> it's different <SIL> also depending on the climate <IVER>
some places you're allowed to wear sandals <SIL> and <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-no> <LAUGH> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
just <CUTOFF-t=to> <SIL> i think it's uh <NOISE> a <CUTOFF-r=reflection> to reflect <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> the <SIL> uh um <SIL> beliefs <SIL> that <SIL> we're trying to <CUTOFF-sh=show> carry and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> i think if someone showed up and looking like <SIL> i mean i'm not saying that it's terrible it but if they had like a nose ring and all this stuff <VOCNOISE> then <SIL> it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> somebody might <SIL> <HES-not> <SIL> believe that they have anything credible to say <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> a lot of times if you're dressed <SIL> more respectfully that to <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i mean most the people will accept you <VOCNOISE> if you're dressed <VOCNOISE> in a dress <VOCNOISE> whereas <SIL> i mean even a person in a nose ring will <CUTOFF-ta=talk> <VOCNOISE> will respect you but <VOCNOISE> but then you're in a <VOCNOISE> you're at a <CUTOFF-l=loss> disadvantage if you don't <LAUGH> dress in a certain way <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right they look at <SIL> more what you have to say then <SIL> your clothes and that that was <CUTOFF-a> <SIL> something i remember them talking about too <VOCNOISE> you don't want them to look at what you're <UNKNOWN> <SIL> what you're wearing <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> that's mostly <VOCNOISE> that was a good <SIL> thing for the dress code just <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well not really they uh have a lot of <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> religious beliefs <SIL> on their own that they've had held on to because <VOCNOISE> um they have just have had nothing <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> they weren't even allowed to <CUTOFF-ha=have> believe in god <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> so a lot of them already believe and that <SIL> they have their own religion <VOCNOISE> and they <VOCNOISE> they're really faithful <VOCNOISE> so that was the <CUTOFF-m=main> one of the main problems is that they <SIL> um <SIL> they had been so <SIL> holding on to that for so <VOCNOISE> long and it's so strong <VOCNOISE> they don't wanna <SIL> let go of <VOCNOISE> what and then the men <SIL> their problem was usually that they would drink a lot <SIL> and <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> the it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was hard to talk to drunk people <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah they're russian orthodox <SIL> same <SIL> basically same thing <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i don't even know what their <SIL> holidays are <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i don't know <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
like <CUTOFF-Cathol=Catholic> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-Cathol=Catholicism> <SIL> oh from mormons <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> our basic <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> real fundamental belief is that <SIL> the church that the <SIL> russians believed in at one time was <SIL> the true church and that it was <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> the <SIL> the same church that christ set up <SIL> when he was on the earth <VOCNOISE> with the twelve apostles and <VOCNOISE> and but the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> after christ died that <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> authority <VOCNOISE> was taken from the earth <VOCNOISE> to <SIL> um have those <SIL> apostles and to <SIL> have the <SIL> the church set up like it was <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it <CUTOFF-w=was> <SIL> must have been really strong because it's still lasted all the same catholic and <CUTOFF-Ortho=Orthodox> all the orthodox churches still carry <UNKNOWN> all these beliefs <VOCNOISE> 
<SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> our belief is that <VOCNOISE> it didn't <SIL> it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it needed to be restored <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-an=and> <VOCNOISE> and we believe i don't know if you've heard about joseph smith <VOCNOISE> or <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well we believe that <SIL> um <SIL> that revelation <VOCNOISE> that was there on earth <VOCNOISE> was <VOCNOISE> actually restored <VOCNOISE> again and <VOCNOISE> through joseph smith because he <VOCNOISE> had <SIL> a desire in his heart to know what was true and he prayed <VOCNOISE> and he actually had a vision where he saw <SIL> god and <VOCNOISE> jesus christ <VOCNOISE> and i know this is all really <SIL> i mean this is like deep doctrine stuff but <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> and he was told that there were <CUTOFF-nah=none> <VOCNOISE> none of the churches on the <SIL> earth were true <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> some of them had good things but they <SIL> their um <VOCNOISE> they weren't exactly hitting the mark <IVER>
and <SIL> that <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <VOCNOISE> it was gonna about to be restored again <VOCNOISE> and so we believe that the true church is actually restored again to the earth <IVER>
and it was through joseph smith and he translated <VOCNOISE> the book of mormon <SIL> with <VOCNOISE> help from god <VOCNOISE> and so that's basically it <VOCNOISE> i mean the book of mormon is <SIL> a counterpart to the bible <SIL> it's a <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> from <VOCNOISE> prophets that lived in america <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so you knew you've heard about that probably <IVER>
oh okay <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> <IVER>
it's easy <SIL> to <CUTOFF-for=forget> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> it <CUTOFF-i=is> it's <SIL> it's american in the <VOCNOISE> from the fact that it's <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> it was written by <VOCNOISE> native americans <SIL> and <SIL> and um <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> and joseph smith was an american <VOCNOISE> and he was <SIL> used to <VOCNOISE> to translate it so it is <VOCNOISE> and it it's actually funny though but <ERROR-there'st=there's> <SIL> more members of the church that live outside of america <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> gotten to the point where there's <SIL> there's <SIL> more than five million outside <IVER>
less in america then <CUTOFF-the=there> <LAUGH> <IVER>
that's exactly what it <LAUGH-i=is> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
oh <UNKNOWN> there was a lot of discouraging things <SIL> just <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> i learned so much <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it <CUTOFF-w=wasn't> and it wasn't always just people rejecting you that was discouraging because that was kind of funny at times <IVER>
people would <SIL> <ERROR-you'n=you'd> <ERROR-dock=knock> on the door and they would <ERROR-yeyal=yell> <VOCNOISE> yell that they weren't home or something and <IVER>
and so <VOCNOISE> it was kind of funny but <SIL> but the <VOCNOISE> discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that don't have any <VOCNOISE> hope and <IVER>
they get so <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=?> <VOCNOISE> they're just so poor and they <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and you <CUTOFF-f=feel> i <CUTOFF-f=felt> <SIL> <CUTOFF-we=well> <VOCNOISE> we felt sometimes like <VOCNOISE> we could help them but <SIL> they didn't want any <VOCNOISE> help and <VOCNOISE> it was kind of hard to <SIL> just <SIL> say okay well <VOCNOISE> i did what i could and <IVER>
i mean <VOCNOISE> not saying that they had to believe what we believe but just <VOCNOISE> even just <SIL> the their attitude about life was so <VOCNOISE> down and <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> they were just so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
there was other things <VOCNOISE> right yeah <VOCNOISE> like we had our service we'd clean up <SIL> neighborhoods or <VOCNOISE> yeah there was a lot of different things <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no i think they liked that <SIL> it <CUTOFF-wa=was> it was really funny because here if you went into a <VOCNOISE> a <VOCNOISE> school or something and said <VOCNOISE> we wanna <VOCNOISE> help <SIL> we wanna teach a class <VOCNOISE> or <IVER>
we wanna clean or anything <VOCNOISE> they would probably say <SIL> yknow they might think it was kind of weird but they <VOCNOISE> would <VOCNOISE> let you <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> but they would be like you wanna do this and we don't have any money to pay you <SIL> oh but we don't <VOCNOISE> yknow we don't want money that's the whole point we're <CUTOFF-s=serving> <IVER>
we wanted to serve you <VOCNOISE> mm they <CUTOFF-v=?> they didn't get that at all <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> they were like <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> some people would just be like no no way it doesn't make sense <LAUGH> <IVER>
probably a little bit <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
there is yeah <IVER>
it'd be a lot more accepted i think here <VOCNOISE> even though it might be kind of <VOCNOISE> i wouldn't do that um <SIL> on my own but <VOCNOISE> if i'm <VOCNOISE> i felt like <VOCNOISE> that was what i was doing all the time so <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> full time <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
i think <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> one of the things that we <SIL> when when you're baptized is that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're really <VOCNOISE> supposed to <VOCNOISE> help other people to <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-na=?> <VOCNOISE> like if <VOCNOISE> if <CUTOFF-yi=you> somebody gives you a gift you wanna give it to someone else <VOCNOISE> but it's <SIL> easy a lot of times just to fall into the <VOCNOISE> yknow like <VOCNOISE> mold of <VOCNOISE> not letting anyone know what you believe and <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> so that they <VOCNOISE> think well what are those weirdos yknow they don't wear makeup or whatever but we <CUTOFF-we=wear> <SIL> we can wear makeup if we want <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> a lot of times people do fall in <VOCNOISE> to sort of <VOCNOISE> but i <VOCNOISE> i was not raised <SIL> mormon so <VOCNOISE> i have a lot of <SIL> my family and friends who are still not members of the church <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> also because it's so new to me that <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> am just <SIL> yknow i will talk about it with anybody and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> and i'm also <SIL> not afraid of people who aren't mormons because i think if you grow up like <VOCNOISE> a member of the church and <VOCNOISE> you might be <CUTOFF-af=afraid> <VOCNOISE> more afraid of people <VOCNOISE> that don't <SIL> believe like you've been taught <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> a lot of the <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> we don't <VOCNOISE> drink alcohol we don't <SIL> there's a lot of restrictions <VOCNOISE> i guess you call them restrictions but they're <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-el=health> <VOCNOISE> i feel like they're more <VOCNOISE> just health codes <VOCNOISE> just keep you healthy and <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it might be <VOCNOISE> it's like if we <CUTOFF-wu=?> <SIL> <EXT-if> <VOCNOISE> america <VOCNOISE> yknow we're <VOCNOISE> we're used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like <VOCNOISE> you might wanna get to know the chinese people but <VOCNOISE> you might not quite <VOCNOISE> be a little timid about <SIL> yknow <ERROR-stame=same> kind of thing <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i'm not i don't have any of those barriers <IVER>
since i've been <VOCNOISE> on both <VOCNOISE> worlds <LAUGH> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
and it really isn't though because <SIL> once <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because <SIL> i think it's actually it's really freeing not to have to drink and <VOCNOISE> all these things so you just kinda <SIL> i feel like i can get along with any <VOCNOISE> people <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> so it doesn't really exclude you from anyone <VOCNOISE> unless you would <VOCNOISE> let it i guess <VOCNOISE> and nobody's <SIL> perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so <VOCNOISE> getting over that is a <VOCNOISE> is <VOCNOISE> part of life <LAUGH> for <LAUGH-everyone> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no they were from all over the world i had <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> one <SIL> companion <VOCNOISE> who was from <VOCNOISE> russia but she was <VOCNOISE> on a temporary mission <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> uh mostly <SIL> all over america but <VOCNOISE> there was a girl from mongolia <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> there was <VOCNOISE> girls <SIL> there who <VOCNOISE> i never was companions with them but they were from russia <VOCNOISE> different <VOCNOISE> mm there was a girl from moscow <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> my mission president was actually from saint petersburg and his wife <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> they didn't speak english <LAUGH> <IVER>
you just get <VOCNOISE> sent <VOCNOISE> wherever <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
it's <IVER>
it's funny because i had studied russian but a lot of the people i served with were <VOCNOISE> fluent in spanish or something else so <VOCNOISE> it's like <VOCNOISE> i don't know why they got sent there but <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i mean we <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> really believe that <SIL> there <SIL> that it's inspired they send <VOCNOISE> our <SIL> your name and a picture and your <VOCNOISE> application <VOCNOISE> to the <SIL> prophet who is the head of the church <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> pray over <SIL> it and they <VOCNOISE> decide where you go <IVER>
so <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> and sometimes it'll take a while to get your <VOCNOISE> call what <UNKNOWN> they <SIL> we call your calling <VOCNOISE> or your call <VOCNOISE> but then you just it's exciting to find out where you're gonna <LAUGH-go> 
<LAUGH-oh> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> that's how i feel <VOCNOISE> that's that's what i <LAUGH-belie=believe> <SIL> i choose to believe that <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> oh <SIL> <CUTOFF-wo=would> <IVER>
yeah it is <IVER>
no no no it's not <SIL> you can do whatever you want <VOCNOISE> there <SIL> uh i've heard conferences where the <CUTOFF-p=prophet> <SIL> um i've heard the prophet talk about how <SIL> you should <CUTOFF-t=?> <SIL> keep in touch with the people that you <SIL> served and <VOCNOISE> or the people that you worked with and that you knew and <VOCNOISE> and that they <SIL> even if they can't <CUTOFF-re=remember> <SIL> you can't remember how to speak just try and <LAUGH> send them a <CUTOFF-le=letter?> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i've been really <LAUGH-ba=bad> about that so i feel <SIL> a lot of pressure to <UNKNOWN> i need to <VOCNOISE> i mean it's <CUTOFF-n=not?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <VOCNOISE> i just don't wanna lose contact with them <SIL> because you <SIL> get these great <SIL> friendships and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but yeah you can <VOCNOISE> there's <SIL> i know people that have <SIL> married people from their <VOCNOISE> i mean that's really not supposed to happen while you're on your mission but <VOCNOISE> when you yknow when you're done if you <VOCNOISE> wanna go back <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> is that happens too <SIL> but it's really not <SIL> looked <SIL> i mean you shouldn't <SIL> that's against <SIL> the rules <VOCNOISE> on the mission <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> if the people wanna get married <SIL> when they get home <VOCNOISE> that's fine <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> yeah that's <SIL> it's <SIL> it's another thing where you're focused trying focus on your work and <SIL> you're not allowed to <SIL> date <SIL> never alone <LAUGH> so <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> you can live where you've <SIL> served you can do whatever you want <SIL> after you're done <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <LAUGH> <IVER>
i actually <SIL> <VOCNOISE> joined the church <VOCNOISE> in uh well i don't know it was six years ago about six years ago <VOCNOISE> and they did a survey here at o s u <SIL> and they were <CUTOFF-u=um> <SIL> um just asking people <VOCNOISE> if they thought <SIL> that christ had visited america and there was a record of that <SIL> account if <SIL> do i think that would be important <SIL> and i was like <SIL> well <SIL> i think so yeah <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> but <SIL> i didn't i was kinda hesitant <SIL> i mean it took me a while to <SIL> i <SIL> read the book of mormon i really <SIL> prayed about it and <SIL> took me about six months <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and then i finally decided that i really <SIL> <CUTOFF-l=liked?> liked it and it was <SIL> what <SIL> i had been wanting <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> so that's how i decided <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no <SIL> i don't think it was because <VOCNOISE> i grew up <SIL> just <SIL> basic <SIL> not even really christian just <SIL> really <VOCNOISE> not <SIL> no real religion <VOCNOISE> and i'd been going <CUTOFF-t=to> to <CUTOFF-pre=presbyterian> presbyterian church <SIL> as i was about nineteen years old <SIL> looking for something a church <VOCNOISE> i just had a feeling that i wanted to <SIL> have that in my life <SIL> because i'd never <SIL> had that before <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> i was just looking around and i was open to anything i had listened to <SIL> eastern religions and <VOCNOISE> i've listened to the jehovah's witnesses and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and then when i <SIL> <VOCNOISE> read in <SIL> the book of mormon it's just <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> it's a feeling of like <SIL> like <SIL> i felt like <SIL> i had heard it before <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it made sense to me <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so that's why <SIL> i really <SIL> felt <SIL> at home with this and that's <SIL> why i decided <IVER>
no i never did i <SIL> i don't know of <SIL> many people that do but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> it was <VOCNOISE> also <SIL> for me i think <VOCNOISE> if i know something's true <SIL> <HES-I> <SIL> i just know it <SIL> and then <VOCNOISE> as long as it keeps on being true over and over again <SIL> if it's not just some exciting thing that <SIL> for one day <UNKNOWN> oh this is great <VOCNOISE> but like <SIL> six months later it still has the same <VOCNOISE> still ringing true <VOCNOISE> a year later two years later <SIL> then <VOCNOISE> that's how i feel <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> i read it <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i do i <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and if <SIL> i read it <VOCNOISE> every <EXT-day> <SIL> i try to <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> and i <VOCNOISE> we go to <SIL> church i have all sorts of activities that i do <VOCNOISE> and i just <CUTOFF-a=always> <SIL> always feeling like i'm reinforced <SIL> that <SIL> it's not <SIL> just some sort of <VOCNOISE> flaky idea that it's <VOCNOISE> for me that it's <SIL> um real and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and it it just <CUTOFF-a=always> always makes sense <SIL> that's important to me that i feel like it <SIL> makes sense <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yes <VOCNOISE> it does <SIL> definitely he went on a mission to texas <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> he's <SIL> he's been back for a while he's thirty two <LAUGH> well he'll be thirty two in april <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> probably it is you're right <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> i asked him what language did he have to to learn to <LAUGH-go> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no he didn't either he joined when he was sixteen <SIL> and he was catholic before <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> similar just <SIL> kind of thing with him just <IVER>
having meeting the missionaries and <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah we met <SIL> um <SIL> at <VOCNOISE> where we there's a singles <SIL> ward <VOCNOISE> where we call ward <VOCNOISE> it's on twelfth avenue <SIL> down here <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it's just where all the <SIL> single <SIL> people under thirty <SIL> go to church and there's <SIL> dances and <SIL> different activities and <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> it's at <SIL> it's at the same building actually it's <SIL> it's <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> it's used for different things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> it's kind of frustrating <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm <SIL> i <SIL> it's a <CUTOFF-go=good> it's probably good for me because <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> it's hard for me to <VOCNOISE> just sit back and let other people <VOCNOISE> believe whatever they want <LAUGH-to_believe> yknow <VOCNOISE> i just want to convince them but <SIL> i can't do that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so it's a good <SIL> exercise for me i look at it that way and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just letting them <SIL> go ahead and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> but there's things that are <SIL> difficult like <VOCNOISE> there <SIL> <UNKNOWN> the <VOCNOISE> where we go <SIL> we <SIL> we have a <SIL> temple too <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they can't go in the temple <VOCNOISE> well they can but they have to <SIL> fit <SIL> fit certain <SIL> criteria they have to be baptized and not <SIL> and follow all these health codes and all the different codes and <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> that's not what they're <SIL> <VOCNOISE> interested in doing <LAUGH-so> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and that's hard i <SIL> think <SIL> and like <SIL> going on a mission <VOCNOISE> really <SIL> they didn't understand that they're my dad was like <SIL> do they know how small you are they're sending you to siberia <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <IVER>
they didn't know <SIL> <IVER>
no <SIL> they thought it was <SIL> my dad told me later that thought i was <VOCNOISE> getting sent off and <SIL> just by myself yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
more like that <SIL> right <IVER>
<LAUGH> yeah right <VOCNOISE> real war <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<EXT-oh> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
that's all right <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
mm <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> i think his mom was pretty <SIL> yknow doesn't really talk about it wanna talk about it <VOCNOISE> he comes from <VOCNOISE> his <VOCNOISE> his <SIL> real <CUTOFF-f=family> <SIL> biological family is very <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know if guess you'd call it dysfunctional or <VOCNOISE> they're <SIL> um <SIL> he didn't live with them <SIL> after he was <SIL> fourteen or so his <SIL> it was just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so bad that <UNKNOWN> his mom couldn't take care of him and his <SIL> his siblings so <VOCNOISE> he was <SIL> pretty much on his <CUTOFF-oh=own> <SIL> own but <VOCNOISE> he was taken in by a family that was members of the <SIL> mormon church <IVER>
<NOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> mm basically they didn't <SIL> legally <SIL> adopt him or anything but <VOCNOISE> they're the ones that he considers his family really <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> i mean he still keeps in contact with his <SIL> mom and his dad <SIL> but it's always kind of a <LAUGH-challenge> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they're just <SIL> her she was drinking <SIL> i mean terrible alcoholic and <VOCNOISE> very his <CUTOFF-ma=mom> his father was very abusive and they didn't weren't even married <IVER>
that he remembers <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> he remembers the stepfathers and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and that kind of thing <VOCNOISE> it's just <SIL> not good <LAUGH-stuff> <IVER>
no it was <SIL> his mom ran away is what happened <IVER>
yeah his mom <SIL> <VOCNOISE> couldn't take care of him anymore and he was like i think he was about fourteen and <VOCNOISE> he just <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> he didn't have really anywhere to go <VOCNOISE> and luckily these families had taken <SIL> his different siblings <SIL> different families took them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know how they got connected with the church because it was all church families that <SIL> took care of them <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was good for him because he's got that example <IVER>
and <SIL> so <SIL> <IVER>
i don't know if there's any particular <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> if someone knows <SIL> if anyone knew of something like that going on they would <SIL> 
<SIL> in a heartbeat try and help them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but they don't i don't think they <SIL> make an effort to like <SIL> put out any <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
okay <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> art <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> drawing and painting is my major <SIL> and <SIL> i <SIL> i um <VOCNOISE> i like doing all sorts of different things they don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i haven't even had any painting classes yet <SIL> so it's kind of funny i'm like taking sculpture and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> drawing and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> next quarter i have a painting class <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum i've <HES-always> been into <SIL> art <SIL> in in high school i went to uh <SIL> art <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=school> <SIL> like uh <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i was <SIL> for fine arts <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> always <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> wanted to do art <VOCNOISE> because i can't do anything <LAUGH-el-else> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no it's <SIL> mostly <SIL> i'm i'm not good at <EXT-math> or i mean i could probably major in english or something like that but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not math <LAUGH> <SIL> <LAUGH-yeah> <SIL> it's is the talent <SIL> my husband's good at math so that's where i <LAUGH-go> <SIL> i'm grateful for <VOCNOISE-that> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> i did <SIL> <IVER>
well i never really <SIL> think i had <SIL> first of all i didn't have <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> motivation i don't think to put in the effort to do it but <SIL> i don't think i had very good advisors when i was first here <VOCNOISE> i didn't really understand the idea of <SIL> that <SIL> u v c was separate from <SIL> art college and <SIL> that you had to <SIL> apply and <SIL> i didn't really know i just like oh okay <IVER>
<NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i just <SIL> well but <VOCNOISE> i didn't understand as much as you <LAUGH-probably> <VOCNOISE> i just like <SIL> like <SIL> clueless as to what i needed to do to become an art major <VOCNOISE> and i'd go to my <SIL> advisor and they'd tell me what to take and it was the art <SIL> advisor but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i didn't really <SIL> think <SIL> i had to do anything special like i didn't <CUTOFF-kn=know> know about the portfolio review and all that stuff <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that was probably my own fault for not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> asking questions but <SIL> so it took me a while and and i just <SIL> kind of <UNKNOWN> <SIL> went to columbus state <SIL> and went on a mission then came back and <SIL> so i just got accepted into that college <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
it's the art school <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> year <IVER>
yeah <SIL> it's <SIL> it's a um <SIL> probably about four years left <SIL> i'm almost done with all my g e c's and everything like that so <SIL> that's about done <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> it's all <VOCNOISE> i've learned a lot it's been interesting <SIL> i've liked my classes <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <CUTOFF-ah=I> i have <SIL> um <SIL> i've <SIL> a have a <SIL> different <CUTOFF-op=options> <SIL> options i'm thinking i could either <EXT-be> an art teacher or have some kind of <VOCNOISE> um freelance type thing to <SIL> from my <EXT-home> <SIL> and <SIL> i <SIL> i really <SIL> want to just <SIL> um hurry up <CUTOFF-s=school?> <SIL> get done with school as fast as i can i <VOCNOISE> we really my husband and i really wanna have kids and so <VOCNOISE> we don't <VOCNOISE-wanna> <SIL> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we don't wanna wait very much longer <VOCNOISE> the some of the classes i'm taking are <SIL> <HES-probably> <SIL> um <SIL> kind of <SIL> dangerous though <SIL> like <SIL> the <SIL> fumes from the paints and stuff <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i can't <SIL> have to wait till those are over <SIL> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
stop yeah those are real chemicals <IVER>
yeah <SIL> you still have to <SIL> be careful and <SIL> yeah <IVER>
so you have how many kids <CUTOFF-us=just?> <IVER>
one <SIL> well that's good <SIL> that's <LAUGH-exciting> <IVER>
oh that's great <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
yeah i can't wait <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well actually he was i don't know if you've heard about <SIL> the <EXCLUDE-name> <EXT-academy> <SIL> deal <VOCNOISE> well he was one the teachers that <SIL> um <SIL> tried to start a union <SIL> and was <SIL> <LAUGH-fired> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well he's he's <SIL> yeah he taught math but they had a general curriculum was just like he taught <SIL> seventh grade <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he gave him math science <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> supposedly social studies <SIL> all the stuff that <SIL> i mean it was just <SIL> it was very poorly run <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to begin with so <SIL> we would go out and <SIL> try and find books for the kids i don't know if <VOCNOISE> you heard that they he hadn't bought them books and <VOCNOISE> so we had to buy them <LAUGH-and> <SIL> i mean they got reimbursed but <VOCNOISE> it was just ridiculous <VOCNOISE> so they were trying to <SIL> do anything they could and <SIL> just to keep their jobs and keep the school <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hum-um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah it's supposed to be an alternative <SIL> type <SIL> to the public schools <VOCNOISE> where they can <VOCNOISE> hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not <IVER>
gotten somewhere <EXT-else> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> right <SIL> education definitely <SIL> and it's military <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah uh he <CUTOFF-hi=his> <VOCNOISE> he and <VOCNOISE> three other people <SIL> well a lot of them had signed the union <SIL> they have to have almost everybody sign <SIL> for it <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> um he was one of the people that had really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> been <VOCNOISE> yes <SIL> and so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he fired him but not for that because <SIL> you can't do that it's illegal <VOCNOISE> so he <VOCNOISE> but he sent a form letter <SIL> with <VOCNOISE> everybody <CUTOFF-ever=everybody> it was exactly the same <SIL> to the three people that were fired <VOCNOISE> except for their names were changed <SIL> for the <SIL> these <VOCNOISE> like basically made up reasons <IVER>
i mean he's uh he's kind of in big trouble they <SIL> they're <VOCNOISE> wanting to pull the charter on him and everything <VOCNOISE> so that <CUTOFF-i=it?> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but he's gonna try and um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> keep the school open which is gonna be ridiculous <IVER>
um-hum <EXCLUDE-name> is his <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> it's just <SIL> it got out of <LAUGH-control> <IVER>
i guess so <VOCNOISE> i hope that they can keep the school somehow <VOCNOISE> for <SIL> the kids and <VOCNOISE> but it won't be him running it <LAUGH> <IVER>
well he's working part time at lazarus but really he doesn't have <LAUGH-anything> <VOCNOISE> so i'm working <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah he wants to teach he's <SIL> he likes football and he wants to <VOCNOISE> coach football but you have to teach to do that so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> he was <SIL> he <SIL> did some assistant coach <SIL> <EXT-work> <SIL> at uh <SIL> o s u <SIL> for o s u <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he really liked that <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh-huh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
except for last year no i'm just kidding <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i i like to watch football i like o s u i've never really gotten into anything else but now <VOCNOISE> he like he likes the um <SIL> denver and <SIL> so i'll watch that with him <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't really know much about it <LAUGH-so> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
yeah that was pretty <LAUGH-bad> <VOCNOISE> i think they <SIL> i don't know what happened <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh really <IVER>
oh you're kidding <IVER>
i do have some relatives that <SIL> are um step <SIL> my stepmom's relatives that are there <SIL> they're actually members of the mormon church <IVER>
so that's <SIL> i guess i do have some <LAUGH-family> <VOCNOISE> by marriage <VOCNOISE> but they live near bloomington <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah i guess they do i don't know what <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> <EXT-where> <SIL> where where it is or how many they have <IVER>
oh you do know <IVER>
oh <IVER>
you probably know more than i do then <VOCNOISE> i never went there with them because <VOCNOISE> uh um <SIL> my dad's very against it <LAUGH> um-hum <LAUGH> he's episcopalian <VOCNOISE> so <LAUGH> <IVER>
did you really you went maybe even to their ward that's funny <VOCNOISE> they're <VOCNOISE> they're the <EXCLUDE-name> not that you would know <LAUGH> 
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah uh she might know <VOCNOISE> her name's <EXCLUDE-name> she's um <SIL> on the school board <SIL> <HES-now> <IVER>
well i don't know if it's monroe county or <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> probably <IVER>
that is what a small world <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
wow <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>

um hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <UNKNOWN> need to pay the rent <LAUGH-and> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's <SIL> um yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
um <SIL> me <SIL> or <IVER>
oh <VOCNOISE> well we <EXCLUDE-name> really wants to go he <VOCNOISE> lived in california that's where that family i told you about was the <SIL> and when he was <CUTOFF-fourtee=fourteen> or sixteen <VOCNOISE> and he really wants to go back <VOCNOISE> so we'll probably end up there sometime but <SIL> after i finish school and <SIL> after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough <SIL> money <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean we don't need to have a ton but we just should be <SIL> <HES-at> least a little out of debt <LAUGH-and_so> <VOCNOISE> yeah <LAUGH> <SIL> something <IVER>
i don't know anything about it but <HES-he> he lived in lompoc which is <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think it's near santa barbara <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> we've talked about l a i don't know anything <SIL> <HES-I've> heard terrible things about it but <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh really <IVER>
san diego's probably why <VOCNOISE> yeah i've heard that's <SIL> a nice place <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's nice <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
columbus um-hum i went to <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <SIL> <ERROR-end=ended> up in an alternative school system all along i <HES-was> <SIL> i got into the <VOCNOISE> lottery <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> <HES-used> <HES-I> i <SIL> made it into every <SIL> school i applied for <IVER>
so went to <EXCLUDE-name> and <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> high school <IVER>
<HES-they> <IVER>
well i didn't necessarily want to <LAUGH-but_that's_where> my family started me out <VOCNOISE> they um <SIL> are alternative to the public schools <VOCNOISE> <HES-supposedly> um <NOISE> just <HES-more> <SIL> i don't know exactly how to explain it <SIL> the only thing that i know is that i never learned to do anything <LAUGH> <IVER>
i never learned math <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> we had in our fifth grade <VOCNOISE> we had the <VOCNOISE> principal realized that nobody knew <NOISE-their> times tables <SIL> he had a big pizza party <SIL> planned for <IVER>
<HES-that> <VOCNOISE> so that if <HES-you> if whoever won <SIL> yknow would get <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> we just went on field trips and had a great time <LAUGH> it might be better <LAUGH-now> <LAUGH> <IVER>
was a guinea pig type <SIL> situation <SIL> it's probably better in high school as more college prep <IVER>
okay <IVER>
no that's fine <IVER>

<IVER>
once upon a time there was a gentleman named <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot <IVER>
every time i fan myself it goes <NOISE-up_it's_a_nice> feature <SIL> sorry i'll stop go ahead <LAUGH> doesn't matter when i clear my throat and you're listening to it it's gonna be annoying as hell <SIL> yeah <SIL> my apologies in advance <IVER>
we're getting more fun stuff all the time but predominantly it's still got way too much cowtown personality <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<NOISE-where> <IVER>
oh <SIL> <UNKNOWN-upstate> <IVER>
i live in albany therefore i'm cool <IVER>
i was born in new york <IVER>
and therefore i'm cool <IVER>
yeah <NOISE-that's_how_it_works> <IVER>
since i was five that makes it twenty years <IVER>
went to <SIL> worthington high school <SIL> and <SIL> in <SIL> the end of my third year it became worthington <VOCNOISE> kilbourne high school and thomas worthington high school <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and so i got to be the first graduating class of this brand new school that they built because the old one had just overflowed beyond <SIL> all <NOISE-recognition> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <SIL> we called it the uh the taj mahal <SIL> because they'd spilled bunches of information into it <SIL> or bunches of money <IVER>
and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was pretty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was fun to be the first class in the school cause everything is brand new <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
cause they're so stylish <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
what they should do is just tell people that their kids don't get to go to school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i bet the attitude changes pretty fast <LAUGH> <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> <IVER>
but it's such a good idea did i go to ohio state yes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yes <SIL> i told you that earlier though but yeah it wasn't being recorded then so it's okay <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <LAUGH-it_was> um <VOCNOISE> well it started out as <SIL> uh computer science under the college of arts and sciences <VOCNOISE> but then there was this whole foreign language requirement and a bad incident with a counselor and eventually i became a <VOCNOISE> a <UNKNOWN-el> proud member of the college of business <IVER>

<NOISE-she> said well <VOCNOISE> you have to take a foreign language you have to i said look i'm not taking any more foreign languages we're gonna figure out how to avoid this or <VOCNOISE> no you have to take a <CUTOFF-for=foreign> i said look lady there are sixty thousand students in this university <VOCNOISE> and if you think that <VOCNOISE> i'm going to believe for a second that they all take foreign language classes after having seen the college of foreign language <VOCNOISE> you're insane <VOCNOISE> there's another way to do this experience <SIL> what is it <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-we=well> you have to take a foreign language i said <SIL> okay <SIL> we're gonna change the question a little bit here you have two options now <SIL> tell me how to avoid taking foreign language <SIL> or tell me how to talk to somebody who isn't you cause that's apparently all i've got available <VOCNOISE> said <VOCNOISE> well you <EXT-have> to take i said how do i talk to somebody else <VOCNOISE> she said well you have to talk to me <SIL> as long as you're in this college <SIL> i was like <VOCNOISE> where's the <EXT-form> <IVER>
so i became a proud <SIL> business major <IVER>
<EXT-no> no it doesn't <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<UNKNOWN-yeah> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
there are some um <SIL> foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding <NOISE-classes> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
there's <VOCNOISE> an <UNKNOWN> there's a feeble attempt to make you well rounded <SIL> is what there is but there's no <SIL> specific <SIL> language <EXT-class> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> it's curious isn't it <IVER>
yeah and as i got older <UNKNOWN> <NOISE-i> <NOISE-continued> to lose interest <NOISE-too> <IVER>
i don't have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you i just <SIL> noticed that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it continued to decline all through high school and i was like yeah you should get out before you actually fail the class <LAUGH> <NOISE> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was <SIL> it was just unpleasant <VOCNOISE> i think i was stupid <VOCNOISE> i think that's what it amounts to <NOISE> not that i was not able to pick up the data <SIL> i was just <SIL> um <SIL> that's uh unwise <VOCNOISE> in in whether or not it was worth while <NOISE> and i believe that it's uh <SIL> horribly worth <SIL> while now <VOCNOISE> and yet now i'm not taking classes <SIL> so <IVER>
<NOISE-in> <IVER>
at the end of march i go <EXT-to> <SIL> europe <VOCNOISE> i travel around for a minimum hundred days with a backpack on my back <IVER>
and outside of english <SIL> french is a <UNKNOWN> horribly popular language <SIL> for <SIL> different countries to have as a second language <VOCNOISE> so i think <UNKNOWN-it'd> be <SIL> extraordinarily useful to me now if i had a greater understanding of french <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-re=reality> reality strikes <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> wander around look at things <IVER>
talk to people <SIL> yes <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> minimum hundred days <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<EXT-ah> <SIL> i had three months <SIL> and then it got postponed then it got postponed again and i was like this is stupid <VOCNOISE> in exchange for postponing it again <SIL> my rationale was fine i'll give myself another ten <CUTOFF-da=days> <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> because it was also a nice <SIL> like <SIL> <UNKNOWN> a hundred is such a pretty round number <IVER>
um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i've a great employer <VOCNOISE> and i <VOCNOISE> i got hired in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> one of the opening lines in the <SIL> interview conversation is hi i am <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in this particular month i'm going to europe but i may or may not come back <SIL> you wanna continue talking <SIL> he said sure let's keep talking <SIL> i said okay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then we continued talking so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> it's up in the air <IVER>
i told him that he gets no guarantee that i will come back <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> in exchange <SIL> i don't get health coverage <SIL> while i'm gone <SIL> <LAUGH-that> <LAUGH-seemed> <LAUGH-perfectly> <LAUGH-reasonable> to me and i <UNKNOWN> okay super <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> my sister had gone a couple times <SIL> <EXT-and> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> basically took me aside <SIL> and i have <VOCNOISE> but one sibling <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> it's fun to have a sibling because nobody is <SIL> more similar to you than that sibling because they had to deal with the <VOCNOISE> inanity that is your family <IVER>
for a long period of time <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <HES-there> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but i imagine your sibling has a a similar world view <SIL> perhaps <SIL> <NOISE-twisted> in some <SIL> <UNKNOWN-some> <SIL> <IVER>
oh <SIL> my my sister's <SIL> <CUTOFF-particular=particularly> religious and that that <SIL> tends to warp her view of everything <IVER>
in a fashion that <SIL> makes it <VOCNOISE> almost diametrically opposed to mine a great many times <VOCNOISE> but at the same time <VOCNOISE> <EXT-the> <SIL> the <UNKNOWN> pre religion understanding of something 
thing <IVER>
is extraordinarily similar <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so what she says might not <SIL> might be diametric opposed to what i say <IVER>
but how she got there she started out somewhere <IVER>
is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> often so similar to where i'm coming from <IVER>
that once you <UNKNOWN> filter it through something it looks different <SIL> but previous to that <SIL> yeah there's a lot there <VOCNOISE> there's <SIL> <ERROR-ch=just> <VOCNOISE> way too much shared experience to <SIL> to gloss over effectively <VOCNOISE> so when she said <SIL> look if you never listen to <SIL> anything else that i say <SIL> you will listen to this <SIL> you need to go to europe <SIL> i <SIL> was like <SIL> okay <SIL> i'll go to europe <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
later <SIL> next <VOCNOISE> <SIL> afterward <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mm-hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> london paris prague budapest amsterdam venice vienna berlin munich <SIL> uh there's <SIL> probably some more on there but that's all of the ones that jump off <VOCNOISE> there's like a a <SIL> a little hit list in my head obviously and <SIL> another hit list in <SIL> my palm pilot <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> life is good <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> can i just say yes <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> i like lots of stuff <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i like games <IVER>
predominantly <VOCNOISE> i like <VOCNOISE> i like playing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i like puzzles <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i like challenges <SIL> i don't like jigsaw puzzles <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i like <SIL> anything that involves <SIL> fixing it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't mind breaking things either <SIL> because then you have something to fix afterwards <VOCNOISE> made me a very bad latchkey child <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i am <SIL> uh i don't actually think that i i <SIL> i could call myself an engineer amongst engineers but <VOCNOISE> uh i think if i was calling myself an engineer to a psychologist it would be okay <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
yeah <HES-it> says <SIL> <IVER>
double e major <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> i'll just keep them as friends <SIL> <LAUGH> that works <SIL> <IVER>
um <SIL> <IVER>
i don't think it ever really occurred to me <IVER>
honestly i don't think it ever really occurred to me <IVER>
<SIL> <UNKNOWN-ri=they're> <UNKNOWN-they're> <HES-just> like <SIL> hmm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> everybody else is taking double e's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i'm having fun over here doing this <SIL> computer science thing and happy joy <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
maybe i should go back get a degree in <SIL> electrical engineering that would be a lot of fun <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> even if they don't pay me it'd still be fun <IVER>
so am i <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i missed your question before that <IVER>
<SIL> i play with computers <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> normally when people ask me i tell them what i did that day <SIL> or what i did the day before if they ask me in the evening or <VOCNOISE> so um <SIL> what did i do today <SIL> <VOCNOISE> what i do today <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> internet information server is a product by microsoft <VOCNOISE> it lets you <SIL> house web pages <VOCNOISE> and put them out on the web <SIL> index serve is another product that lets you <SIL> put search engines on that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> then there's another product by a company called splitcycle it's called netstock it sucks <VOCNOISE> netstock basically goes out to yahoo and checks to see <SIL> what the stock prices on something are <SIL> and <SIL> so <SIL> i made netstock <SIL> iis and index server <SIL> all play nicely together today <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> both <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> today i was farmed out to bank one <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> yesterday <SIL> was monday i was farmed out to bank one <SIL> friday <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> farmed out to bank one but now i've resolved all those three issues <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they don't have anything else to throw at me interesting <VOCNOISE> so i'm leaving <SIL> tomorrow i'll be back at the home office <SIL> working on some other stuff that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> will benefit us in franchising because franchising is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a much better way to make <SIL> money than selling time for <UNKNOWN> <SIL> for money <SIL> selling time for money <SIL> for money sucks <SIL> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
selling time for money <SIL> yes <IVER>
<IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes <SIL> muchos money <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
familiar with sarcom yes <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah but it's not a good way for me to make money <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-because> <SIL> if you're farming out <SIL> people <SIL> or if you're better still <SIL> drop it down a level <VOCNOISE> if you are exchanging <SIL> hours <SIL> for money <SIL> or <SIL> time <SIL> for money <VOCNOISE> then you have a finite amount of time <SIL> and that sucks <SIL> <IVER>
should have some other thing to exchange for money <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i would much rather exchange ideas for money <VOCNOISE> or previously done work for money <VOCNOISE> or something obnoxious and stupid like a franchise for money <VOCNOISE> i'm in favor of that <VOCNOISE> i come up with a good system by which to do things <SIL> i sell it to you <VOCNOISE> you go do those things <VOCNOISE> i sit around and make money off of your efforts <SIL> yeah that <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> sure <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> um <VOCNOISE> going into business for myself <SIL> i need something to sell <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and selling my own time doesn't actually seem to be a worthwhile endeavor <VOCNOISE> i've done it <SIL> i've already <VOCNOISE> done independent consulting <SIL> <EXT-ah> wherein <SIL> i set up a contract and said <VOCNOISE> hi <SIL> you pay me i'll do this thing <SIL> and i go do that thing and you make a lot of money like that <VOCNOISE> problem is you get taxed obscenely like that because you don't have an employer paying half your taxes for you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> there's <SIL> other bunches of overhead involved <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> there's <SIL> the constant cycle of marketing oneself <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it all depends on how much you wanna market yourself <SIL> <VOCNOISE> marketing yourself is <SIL> easier for some people than for others <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it's <SIL> more fun for some people than for others <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-so> <VOCNOISE> so far i don't know if i <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it's a lot easier to market yourself <IVER>
beggars i love it <NOISE> <IVER>
<EXT-mm> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN-okay> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> end of march i don't have a plane ticket yet i have a eurail pass though <SIL> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yes <SIL> <IVER>
hi i'm approachable <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
do do do <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> bruge in belgium <VOCNOISE> b r u g e <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
bruge in belgium <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i have a game going on with a good friend of mine named michelle <VOCNOISE> i have this stupid ring here you see the ring <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so um <SIL> i have lost <NOISE> something like two incarnations of this ring just flat out lost them <VOCNOISE> because well ah i'm an irresponsible cuss <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> one of them <SIL> a third if you will <VOCNOISE> i gave to her <SIL> <IVER>
or more accurately i think she took it <SIL> but <SIL> it's a fine line <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so she wears that around <SIL> and <SIL> <EXT-I> <SIL> replaced it <SIL> so i had my own again i wear this one around so we have a competition to see who can get the most well traveled ring <VOCNOISE> you get two points for every country <SIL> and you get one point for every state or province within that country <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> it counts if you're touching the ground <SIL> or if something that you're sitting on is touching <IVER>
<EXT-I> know <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> you <CUTOFF-g=get> you get to take advantage of it <VOCNOISE> for layovers and stuff it's <IVER>
it's pretty cool <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
<SIL> i i don't hate all <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
<NOISE> <EXT-ah> <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> okay <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well i'm not adopting that rule <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fortunately the judge of our game isn't listening to our conversation so i feel kind of safe <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> a mutual friend uh much better friend of mine than of hers <VOCNOISE> but she's more attractive than i am so we figured it all balanced out <SIL> <LAUGH> we decided that made him unbiased <SIL> <IVER>
mm-hmm <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> she has already been to europe twice sadly <SIL> and has accumulated <SIL> all of forty four thirty four points <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> <IVER>
two for country <SIL> one per state or province <IVER>
<SIL> no <SIL> <IVER>
no <SIL> <IVER>
once you're in it you're been in it and that's it <VOCNOISE> i have thirty two points <SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> belgium <SIL> what do you think <SIL> western europe <SIL> netherlands holland <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> doesn't know his geography for shit <LAUGH> for the record <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
i've already learned an immense amount looking at my eurail thing <SIL> okay so belgium is <EXT-uh> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
<SIL> okay 
<SIL> belgium is it's own country <IVER>
i don't know where i'm going to fly into honestly i'm <NOISE-thinking> <NOISE-of> <ERROR-ih=of> doing a courier flight <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> mm-hmm <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
town with the chunnel <IVER>
take the ferry from <ERROR-southeastt=southeast> london <SIL> <IVER>
prague <SIL> <VOCNOISE> czech <SIL> republic <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> budapest <IVER>
that's the optimism yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> okay i have now dover <SIL> and ferry <SIL> what else do i need to remember <IVER>
<SIL> okay now i have <SIL> bruge <SIL> ferry to <SIL> i'm sorry <VOCNOISE> dover ferry to bruge belgium <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then train <IVER>
at that point i <ERROR-gi=get> to activate <SIL> my eurail pass <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i teach a class on thursday nights <NOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> how to play with computers <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-I> um <SIL> play games on tuesday nights <SIL> <IVER>
<EXT-games> <SIL> i don't know <EXT-we> we vary it from one week to the next <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE-either> <SIL> role playing games <IVER>
under whatever system <NOISE-is> popular that <SIL> day <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> <EXT-or> card games <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> not usually fifty two card deck cards but <SIL> other interesting types of cards <IVER>
or board games <SIL> or <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> anything that happens to appeal <SIL> <IVER>
is a <IVER>
group of five guys who know each other <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <EXT-mm> <SIL> no <SIL> some of them play at game stores <NOISE-but> i <SIL> done it once and said eh <SIL> it wasn't that good <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and continue merrily on with <SIL> my day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> there you go <IVER>
i had enough <SIL> friends who said to me <VOCNOISE> can you make money with computers <SIL> <NOISE-and> i said <SIL> yes you can make <ERROR-oney=money> with computers <SIL> and i said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what <SIL> could i <oney=money> with computers <SIL> <IVER>
then i finally just said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> okay <SIL> <LAUGH> training people to make <SIL> money with computers <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> <IVER>
none of these <NOISE-people> <VOCNOISE> would <SIL> well <SIL> no <SIL> some of these people would know what ebay is but probably only one or two out of like six <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what we're talking an extraordinarily low level understanding of what computers are how they work so <VOCNOISE> class one was demystifying the computer <SIL> we took it apart <VOCNOISE> we labeled everything inside i gave them all a piece i said put it back together <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we turned it on we saw if it <SIL> worked <SIL> we went back in figured out why it didn't work <SIL> took it apart again <VOCNOISE> this wasn't something can do hardware because hardware <VOCNOISE> <SIL> has <SIL> no money in it <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um it was so that they're not scared of the magic box <IVER>
and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scared of the magic box and could continue to operating systems <EXT-word> <EXT-um> <SIL> the goal of learning operating systems is real simple <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if you're playing with computer <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you screw something up <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the worst thing you can possibly do <SIL> is screw it up so badly that you have to start over <SIL> <IVER>
starting over means <SIL> putting a new operating system on it <IVER>
<SIL> <SIL> anything else <SIL> is a hardware failure and you have to go <SIL> fix it <SIL> somewhere else anyway <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> if you know how to put an operating system on your machine <SIL> you can start over <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you can start over there's no reason to be scared of anything that you do <SIL> problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they're going to break something <SIL> <IVER>
so once you convince people that there's nothing <ERROR-ne=to> be scared of here and there's nothing to be scared of there <VOCNOISE> i mean and then they start to play <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> and once you start playing you start learning <SIL> <IVER>
if you can't play <SIL> you won't learn you just sit there and follow my directions and that's dumb <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> most of them are still sadly just sitting there and following my directions but they're getting better <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <EXT-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> weekends i usually try and keep <SIL> free <SIL> so that i can <SIL> make stuff up <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> and uh <SIL> i don't <VOCNOISE-know> <SIL> because of the usually the the one night a week that isn't <SIL> horribly well scheduled <VOCNOISE> wednesday nights are preparing for travel <SIL> <IVER>
and you told me not to this that <SIL> <ERROR-s=so> <SIL> trying <ERROR-t=to> stick to that sorry <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> <IVER>
friday nights are date night <SIL> <IVER>
because i become unpopular if i have <SIL> like <SIL> <NOISE> any time away from my girlfriend <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> the more time i have away <ERROR-fram=from> <SIL> no <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> no <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh this is sherry <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <EXT-uh> i spend time away from sharon i become unpopular <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and if i continue to do that for a long <SIL> for long period time i become very unpopular <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> so to that end we have <VOCNOISE> a designated friday evening date night <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> sherry usually tries to get <SIL> all of saturday and all of sunday as date night as well <SIL> sort of like an extended date weekend thing <IVER>
this is a game we play every weekend <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <SIL> it's <EXT-a> <SIL> okay game <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> monday night <SIL> i usually <SIL> come up with something dumb that needs to occur <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> this <VOCNOISE> was something that i would have done <SIL> on a monday night <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
for whatever reason <LAUGH> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> if i'd grown up with them maybe they'd have that thing going on that my sister has which is a bunch of <VOCNOISE> shared mutual experiences but as it stands they're just weird <SIL> <IVER>

what i'm saying when i talk to them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or my mother <SIL> very nice human being <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and a bunch of people i don't know <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> mm <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<EXT-I> think my mother was okay with it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <CUTOFF-a=all> all the conversations <UNKNOWN-I> had about <UNKNOWN> since then lead me to believe <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yes this didn't traumatize her <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think it was kind of a no brainer for her as well <SIL> she's like ah yeah all your friends and your dad <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a large new experience that you don't know anything about <SIL> and me <VOCNOISE> talking to my mother was always a very arduous affair <IVER>
<CUTOFF-na=not> not <SIL> in sort of an evil sense <SIL> necessarily and but just in sort of a a challenging sense consistently <VOCNOISE> yes <CUTOFF-the=there> there was some sort of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> inherent communication breakdown my mother is kind of a flake <VOCNOISE> not that i'm not a flake but we're flaky in different ways <IVER>
yes <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE-correct> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <NOISE-that's> rude <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> trying come up with <SIL> like <EXT-uh> <SIL> <EXT-uh> a narrative that's <SIL> both fun and brief <SIL> <VOCNOISE> okay so <VOCNOISE> <EXT-um> <SIL> my friend chris and i are upstairs playing on the computer <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <EXT-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my sister's downstairs watching television <SIL> it's sunday morning <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> i am <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> trying to figure out how this game works <NOISE-trying> <NOISE-to> <NOISE-figure> how this game works and then i said <HES-I> got some information on this game out in the car i'm gonna go get it <SIL> chris you keep playing <VOCNOISE> i'll be right back <VOCNOISE> downstairs out the front door see my sister on <UNKNOWN-the> couch go over to the car <VOCNOISE> get the stuff out of the <NOISE-car> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> look up and there two police <NOISE-officers> coming towards me <SIL> <IVER>
like ooh <SIL> police officers <IVER>
ooh scary <VOCNOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> and <CUTOFF-i=it> <VOCNOISE> it was funny because <VOCNOISE> you see the cops first <VOCNOISE> but in reality the cops are behind <NOISE-two> other people i actually know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but it doesn't matter <NOISE> because you always see cops first <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> the two other people that i actually know are <EXT-my> <EXT-stepmother> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-stepmother's> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> parents <SIL> <VOCNOISE> stepmother and father have been split up for i don't know a month or two now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they've been married for something like six months now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> my sister and i both wanted to tell her ahead of time that she's making a horrible mistake but <VOCNOISE> she wouldn't have listened to us so we didn't bother telling her <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they're coming up and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh there has been like divorce papers and stuff ah <UNKNOWN> and i knew that <SIL> police officers are occasionally used to deliver important documents <VOCNOISE> i don't personally think that divorce documents are that important <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> nothing's beyond the realm of possibility for people take things way out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> way too seriously <VOCNOISE> yes <IVER>
yes <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> there's nobody at home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so i just figured <VOCNOISE> something weird's going on i didn't know what was going on but at the same time <VOCNOISE> it was all divorce related <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> basically dumb <VOCNOISE> because <SIL> the divorce wasn't going to faze me because <SIL> the entire marriage was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we knew <HES-we> knew from the beginning it was a dumb idea <VOCNOISE> and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable <VOCNOISE> so we're just kind of waiting around going oh they're gonna be divorced in a couple months <VOCNOISE> and sure enough so anyway <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <EXT-so> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i look at these people and their names are the <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> and so the <EXCLUDE-name> are coming forward with two police officers behind them <VOCNOISE> and mister <EXCLUDE-name> is kind of a large gentleman and he's way too somber <NOISE-for> <NOISE-this> experience and <VOCNOISE> if you have to like be that somber about something as stupid as a divorce i'm going to give you some sort of shit for it <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> at the <NOISE-same> <NOISE-time> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> um mrs <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> used to be a principal of mine elementary school <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh my stepmother's <IVER>
mother <VOCNOISE> used to be a principal of mine in elementary school <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh he's like <EXCLUDE-name> <HES-I> think we should talk <SIL> was like <SIL> okay great <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> okay so i was like <ERROR-ho=oh> boy you're way too serious for this particular affair <VOCNOISE> okay that's <ERROR-sine=fine> <VOCNOISE> we knew ahead of time this also coming to an end don't worry about it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i <EXT-I> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for <VOCNOISE> i don't know where that is <SIL> i never found it never saw it never it it's <VOCNOISE> anyway <SIL> not relevant at all the story but <VOCNOISE> it bugs me every time i tell the story because <VOCNOISE> doesn't exist <VOCNOISE> anyway <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> we come back inside and he's like well i've got some bad news and my sister's like <SIL> why <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-ae=and> like all <SIL> okay go ahead <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he's like <SIL> no i <CUTOFF-thi=think> i think you should sit down i'm like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
all right <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
at at this point <HES-I> <HES-I> stopped for moment i'm just like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-so> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> nobody can think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> their divorce was so important that i need to sit down to deal with it because <HES-I> <HES-I> obviously <VOCNOISE> i <HES-I> i have the curiosity that something whack is <HES-uh> <SIL> is uh <SIL> is afoot <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-and> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-tso=so> i <VOCNOISE> okay <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i sit down <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> say <VOCNOISE> your your father killed himself this morning <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i said <SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> and then there's like <HES-a> sort of a whited out <SIL> period there so <VOCNOISE> you don't get like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> decent details on on what occurred i <NOISE-don't> <NOISE-actually> think anything exciting occurred <VOCNOISE> i think mostly it's me and <SIL> my sister on my lap <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and me smelling my sister's <SIL> wet <SIL> stinky hair <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because it smelled of cigarette smoke for some reason <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> wet stinky hair <VOCNOISE> wet because i was crying into it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-and> <EXT-um> <SIL> and then more time passes so some <CUTOFF-in=indeterminate> indeterminate length of time <VOCNOISE> later <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i i look over at the police officer who's <SIL> standing on one side and the cops are there basically to make sure i don't freak out <VOCNOISE> and that's finally sunk in i was like <VOCNOISE> the cops are here so you don't freak <SIL> and like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh i'm not really in any danger of freaking out <SIL> am i <SIL> then you're <LAUGH> and <UNKNOWN> was like <VOCNOISE> what would freaking out look like <VOCNOISE> you would never know <VOCNOISE> that's why the cops are here oh <LAUGH-okay> <LAUGH-cool> <LAUGH-that> <LAUGH-makes> <LAUGH-more> <LAUGH-sense> <LAUGH-then> <VOCNOISE> i was like okay so <SIL> i looked there's a cop i said <SIL> i have a friend <SIL> upstairs and i wasn't able to put on anything more than that <SIL> and it <NOISE-didn't> come out <NOISE-anywhere> near that well <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> managed get that much information out <VOCNOISE> so the other cop goes upstairs and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> chris <SIL> chris's interpretation of the story at this point is <VOCNOISE> one moment i'm cheerfully playing on the computer and the next moment <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <NOISE> i turn around there's a large police <LAUGH-officer> <LAUGH-ih=in> <LAUGH-doorway> of your room <VOCNOISE> he said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> hi <SIL> <LAUGH> he said i think you should come downstairs <VOCNOISE> they don't tell chris anything <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so chris comes downstairs and he <NOISE-stands> beside me <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and the cops on <UNKNOWN-the-other> side of chris <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and now chris is just <SIL> <NOISE> near me trying to be <SIL> near me has no idea what <NOISE> the hell is going on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <LAUGH> <HES-I> i this <SIL> this sinks into <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> i was like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE-you> <SIL> you <SIL> don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> did they tell <CUTOFF-y=you> <CUTOFF-y=you> any <SIL> <CUTOFF-d=do> you <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he said <SIL> i have no idea what's going on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and i couldn't <NOISE-do> anything about <VOCNOISE> i couldn't tell him i couldn't communicate i was <VOCNOISE> totally <LAUGH-incapable> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <UNKNOWN-and> <IVER>
well the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> communication wasn't there <IVER>
yeah well there wasn't even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it it just <NOISE> there was nothing there there was no ability to communicate there was a <VOCNOISE> he needs to know this piece of information at the same <NOISE-time> there's no way i could tell it to him so <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> is like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> so i'm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah you don't know and there's <NOISE> nothing else to do about it and continue on merrily and he's i he said eventually he said it was some time later when i actually found out <LAUGH-what> <LAUGH-was> going on i said i had some suspicions <VOCNOISE> because you can do a quick party count and figure out who's not there and assume something bad has happened but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um but <SIL> he said <SIL> but it <NOISE> was a while before i found out actually <SIL> so <SIL> so we can stop <SIL> we can stop the story here or we can go on because this story <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> it's a fun story but <IVER>
okay <EXT-so> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> chris and i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-uh> spent <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the rest of the evening <SIL> calling people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> i got it in my head that i didn't want anybody to call and to say how's your dad doing <VOCNOISE> and so the best way to deal with that situation was to call <SIL> <EXT-globally> <VOCNOISE> cross the board <VOCNOISE> plus it was a fun psychological experiment just <VOCNOISE> as <SIL> as they go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> cause <VOCNOISE> how often do you get to tell <LAUGH-people> <LAUGH> your dad just killed himself this <SIL> morning <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <EXT-I> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-I> <SIL> <EXT-hi> how you doing <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> no i haven't talked to you in a little while is everything going okay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> actually no my <SIL> my father killed himself this <SIL> morning <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're kidding <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> you you end up <VOCNOISE> after a dozen or so people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> narrowing it down <VOCNOISE> you've got you're kidding <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you're not serious <SIL> <EXT-no> <IVER>
<EXT-really> <VOCNOISE> oh my god <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then you can hash mark them if you want we didn't but you could <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> we had two people who who <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> said <VOCNOISE> you're kidding <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> never mind i'm sorry pretend i never even said that <SIL> i was like <SIL> wow <SIL> somebody must've done this before <LAUGH> because everybody is just like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's no other response <VOCNOISE> but <IVER>
<ERROR-thi=there's> so there's there's no faulting i mean these folks but <SIL> still there's nothing else do and there's nothing creative in response to say to this experience so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you end up with you're kidding again and again and again <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you had two individuals who said you're kidding and then immediately following it <CUTOFF-ya=you're> <UNKNOWN-like> <SIL> never mind pretend i never <NOISE-that> that <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah he was he was giving me phone numbers for <SIL> at least <SIL> two or three hours <VOCNOISE> we had <SIL> uh several phone books <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> church calling list and some other <SIL> <ERROR-nauseous=obnoxious> stuff we had just bunches of numbers <VOCNOISE> and so he just fed me names and numbers <VOCNOISE> and i <NOISE-went> <NOISE-through> <NOISE-them> <VOCNOISE> it's not ten after <VOCNOISE> okay <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so let's see at the end of that <SIL> um <NOISE> there was a lot of supporting <SIL> uh <SIL> erin <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then there was some calling of like family people <VOCNOISE> younger <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> so there was supporting of erin and then there was calling of girlfriend <VOCNOISE> but you can't do the calling of girlfriend until you've arranged for ride because girlfriend lives two and a half hours away <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so if you call the girlfriend and tell the girlfriend that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that your father just killed himself <VOCNOISE> she freaks out because she <UNKNOWN-hh=has> no way to get there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <NOISE> you have to arrange for ride first <SIL> <VOCNOISE> ended up having a guy who lives in logan drive up to bowling green <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to get her <SIL> and then drive back down <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-to> <SIL> uh bring her back <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he said is there anything i can do i i'm gonna come up there <SIL> i said sure <SIL> drive <SIL> by <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I> <LAUGH-said> continue on to <VOCNOISE> he's like okay <SIL> fine <SIL> no problem <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i said <VOCNOISE> then i <SIL> then i could call <VOCNOISE-evan> and say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he will be there <EXT-in> three hours <SIL> <UNKNOWN-there'll> be a nice silver r x seven at <NOISE-this> location get in <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so <SIL> she spent the next <SIL> two and a half hours canceling classes and stuff <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <SIL> he <VOCNOISE> he's polite i'll give him that much <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE-okay> well <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i defended my stepmother <SIL> uh <SIL> against the rest of my family immediately following my father's death because there was ah some bitterness between the rest of my family and my stepmother <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so my sister and i defended my stepmother against the rest of my family <VOCNOISE> stepmother eventually shafted us <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> so stepmother is evil <IVER>
they're fun <IVER>
just saying stepmother makes <SIL> me go <UNKNOWN-ih> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
hope your father doesn't drink <IVER>
oh well that's unfortunate <LAUGH> <IVER>
okay <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> 
<IVER>
my name is <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
what department <IVER>
<NOISE> oh just <NOISE> was going down like <IVER>
<SIL> oh i tightened this good <NOISE> it's like it's falling i oh it there it can go <SIL> <NOISE> <NOISE> cool <SIL> perfect <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
okay <SIL> uh my name is <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> <EXT-I> <EXT-uh> am an undergrad double major in german and history currently working on a senior honors thesis <VOCNOISE> in history <VOCNOISE> i will be graduating next quarter <VOCNOISE> after a grand total of six years as an undergrad <VOCNOISE> an impressive uh somewhat <VOCNOISE> disturbing six years as an undergrad <SIL> ah i live in german village <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> i like it here <SIL> grew up here <SIL> like it here <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i think of it as a big city <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> having been to other big cities it <SIL> feels more like that then small towns which <SIL> i've also <SIL> been to of course but <IVER>
my thesis is on the sudeten germans those are the germans who lived in czechoslovakia <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> before the <VOCNOISE> second world war <SIL> and uh specifically i'm looking at how they perceived their condition <VOCNOISE> switching from being part of the austro-hungarian empire <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and the germans being sort of the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> the majority <SIL> uh even though they weren't the majority but sort of the the uh the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the master nation within the austro-hungarian empire to becoming uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-mit-minority> a minority within czechoslovakia <IVER>
ah i've always had an interest in <VOCNOISE> german history <VOCNOISE> and also in eastern european history <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i mean it seemed to be a natural way that i could tie those two together for a thesis <SIL> <IVER>
german <SIL> yeah <IVER>
all right well <LAUGH> as most people don't like to hear <VOCNOISE> uh relatives and stuff i'm taking a year off <IVER>
and then ah <SIL> <ERROR-abtending=attending> grad school <IVER>
uh i <VOCNOISE> plan at this point to <SIL> pursue history to the <SIL> p h d level <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah <SIL> anything of course can happen <IVER>
but <SIL> that's my plan <IVER>
uh relax <SIL> uh get a a dead end job that doesn't come home with me <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> try and pay off my debt <SIL> and maybe make a little bit <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i i i uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> grad school yeah <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> also enjoy all the things i didn't get to do <IVER>
uh <SIL> while <SIL> working on this thesis this is <CUTOFF-be=been> project that has been ongoing for about a year <VOCNOISE> and i've <VOCNOISE> voluntarily given up a lot of things i like to do and i'm looking forward to catching up <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> music <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> painting <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> that sort of thing <IVER>
yeah just having fun <IVER>
yes i have several times <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> well one of the things i'm doing is i'm applying for a number of research grants to go to germany continue my research so hopefully i'll get one of those <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i <SIL> think i'm in pretty good <VOCNOISE> shape to get one of those so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh that's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that might <SIL> cause me to put off grad school for a year but <SIL> i don't think the grad schools will mind if i <SIL> <IVER>
if they have <CUTOFF-so=someone> someone who gets a grant who's already <SIL> planning to go to their school so <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
not too much <SIL> uh i was planning on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i hadn't always planned on taking a year off but getting into the research uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-ha=has> like one of the things i sacrificed was looking into grad schools and applying to grad school this past <VOCNOISE> <SIL> year so <VOCNOISE> yeah so <SIL> uh <SIL> i mean i i'd like to go here it's one of my <ERROR-s=?> choices cause i like the faculty and i like the program but <SIL> uh uh <SIL> i plan to spend the next couple months well <SIL> the first few months after i graduate looking at other schools <SIL> <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> take care of that soon <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
cool <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
ah <IVER>
right <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i would like to teach <SIL> um <SIL> mm the <SIL> the field is <SIL> particularly saturated right now so i'm not <VOCNOISE> holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean i'd like to think that i could distinguish myself within the field and get a job but <VOCNOISE> i mean right now those jobs simply are not available <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> uh i'm <SIL> approaching things like whatever happens happens i'm gonna pursue my interests and then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about <SIL> career plans after i finish my schooling <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> oh yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i got into painting somewhat recently <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i've always done a lot of art <SIL> uh <SIL> my mom is an elementary school art teacher so i was always exposed to <SIL> art <SIL> as child <SIL> uh did pretty good <SIL> too <VOCNOISE> i never got into painting it was mainly drawing that kind of thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and just uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah three or four years ago i thought i'm gonna learn how to paint <SIL> and i learned how to paint <SIL> <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i like painting <IVER>
so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> most of my paintings uh uh <CUTOFF-thi=this> this is gonna sound funny most of my paintings <SIL> are of <SIL> uh <SIL> images from star wars <IVER>
now <VOCNOISE> this <SIL> most of my paintings were completed <SIL> uh before <VOCNOISE> uh like nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six before <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it came back out it was more of a thing <SIL> like images from my childhood coming back out <SIL> and now it's suddenly <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> you hear about it more often so <VOCNOISE> that's why i'm a little funny but <SIL> used to be impressed like i paint star wars <IVER>
<UNKNOWN-like> i paint sesame street or something i don't paint <CUTOFF-ses=sesame> sesame street just something from childhood <VOCNOISE> that i paint and now it's <VOCNOISE> somewhat mainstream so it sounds a little funny i also i've <SIL> painted <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a <CUTOFF-cou=couple> couple of portraits <NOISE> pretty happy with of some friends i <SIL> have done a self portrait <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> that kind of thing <SIL> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ye=yes> kind of <SIL> uh i mean it was something i was really into <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> until <SIL> i don't know maybe about fourth or fifth grade at which <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> point things sort of switched to <SIL> yknow like i don't know like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> killer robots or something like transformers that kind of thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh in high school <SIL> i uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know i think i cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys i'm like star wars is fun i'm gonna watch star wars more often i had them on tape so i <SIL> started watching them and got <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't wanna say into it because i know people who are <SIL> really into it <VOCNOISE> i'm pretty into it but it's not the same kind of thing i don't think but <SIL> back when i started doing the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the painting uh <VOCNOISE> i i graduated from high school in ninety four just to put things in a little perspective <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> so something like my first couple years of college <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh from <HES-m> sort of the second half of <VOCNOISE> high school to my first couple years of college i was just sort of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just <SIL> i don't know i liked the story <SIL> um 
<SIL> i liked looking at the stories from a <SIL> different perspective as a kid as a kid i was i was always like <SIL> <IVER>
oh boy like <SIL> action <SIL> oh <SIL> fight the bad guys yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and now it's <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow like <SIL> looking <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> sort of postulating deeper <VOCNOISE> meaning to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> what the characters have to go through using <SIL> elements of the story as a metaphor <VOCNOISE> for <SIL> things in real life <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child and <HES-upon> our culture i think it's kinda interesting and now that it's coming back <SIL> out <SIL> uh <SIL> i mean i <SIL> look at things from a little different perspective but <VOCNOISE> i mean yeah <SIL> <SIL> of the <SIL> maybe <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think i've done about ten twelve paintings of which i'm <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> consider to be done and <SIL> and like <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh i'd say <SIL> eight of them <LAUGH-are_Star> wars related kinda thing <VOCNOISE> so the recent ones have been the <LAUGH-portraits> actually but <SIL> i like star wars <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i didn't like it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> i liked elements of it <SIL> and <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> unlike the the first star wars movie <VOCNOISE> this one really is meant to be part of a trilogy <VOCNOISE> the first star wars movie when it came out <SIL> i mean it was <SIL> uh uh in <CUTOFF-s=some?> many ways an experiment it was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> part of a of a larger story <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> because the larger story was too large to film in one <CUTOFF-f=film> <VOCNOISE> one movie <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> this one as a as a <SIL> as a part of a whole <SIL> i i'm <SIL> reserving complete judgment until <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> until see what else happens i mean from what i know <VOCNOISE> <SIL> this story was kinda happy and it was it <UNKNOWN> <SIL> many ways a children's story <VOCNOISE> but what has to happen within the larger story between now and <SIL> and <SIL> yknow the end of <SIL> episode three <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like <SIL> the republic falls <SIL> and the empire takes over and all the jedi are killed by this cute little eight year old kid <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i'd always maintained that uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> back in the day uh <SIL> the darth vader was the tragic hero of the star wars thing it wasn't <SIL> yknow about <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> the innocence of luke skywalker <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> rebellion and <IVER>
<SIL> casting off authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a bad choice <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow gaining power because of it <SIL> and then ultimately seeing the the folly of the ways and dying <SIL> in the classic <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> tragic hero sort of <VOCNOISE> way <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and so i'm looking forward to how they build up to that point <VOCNOISE> um lot of people when i was in high school they're what the hell are you talking about bo <VOCNOISE> but uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> yeah i'm looking forward to seeing how things <VOCNOISE> <SIL> come about <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
ah i like star trek <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not so much old star trek <SIL> uh i like deep space nine of the new ones <SIL> um <SIL> i mean <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> back when it was new i liked the next generation but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> once deep space nine came out and it had a grittier <SIL> darker story that <SIL> wasn't so <VOCNOISE> cookie cutter in fashion there was <CUTOFF-ki=kind> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode <SIL> and <SIL> more character development <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it wasn't like these perfect <SIL> people on this ship going and facing bad <ERROR-peo=people> the the characters themselves had flaws <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that caused for better drama so i like that don't like <SIL> voyager so much i <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=see> <VOCNOISE> i see that it <SIL> when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it <SIL> as something that would be even grittier <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-eve=even> <SIL> they had the the potential for for <SIL> excellent <SIL> intercharacter conflict <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but they glossed over all those immediately <VOCNOISE> <SIL> within the first season <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> that <SIL> really bothered me and then <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> ultimately the story's like <SIL> they're trapped <VOCNOISE> but they don't <SIL> really pursue like the <SIL> issues of being separated from home in <SIL> two factions that had <IVER>
very big differences <SIL> stuck together on a small ship <VOCNOISE> they just <SIL> glossed over those and it became just like the next generation except for they didn't <SIL> talk to the federation as much anymore so i didn't like that one so much but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
her her little boyfriend who was the <SIL> the captain kirk <VOCNOISE> commander riker <CUTOFF-per=person> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> stud persona <VOCNOISE> i see in many ways <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean i agree in deep space ah um <SIL> big deep space nine fan it's like i don't dislike voyager i just don't like it to the same degree <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> in deep space nine they had major kira who was a soldier <SIL> and a revolutionary <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> <HES-ih> i thought in many ways she <SIL> like <SIL> completely broke out of traditional gender roles i <SIL> also like deep space nine in that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they address the issue of different people living and working <CUTOFF-togeth-together> different people of different <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean these were <SIL> aliens rather than different <CUTOFF-eth=ethnic> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ethnic denominations of humans but it it <SIL> approached that from a less <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> from uh a more realistic standpoint in instead of having it yknow like an old star trek yknow everyone gets along then we <SIL> come to people who don't get along and we look at the problems <VOCNOISE> it was <VOCNOISE> centered on that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <NOISE> <SIL> i i'm getting off topic i wanted to go back to to <VOCNOISE> Voyager what you were saying about the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the <SIL> the uh <SIL> generals i <SIL> i liked <CUTOFF-h=having> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at first having <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> captain janeway being a female in the leadership standpoint but i <CUTOFF-f=feel?> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i still think that <SIL> uh <SIL> the <CUTOFF-f=female> <VOCNOISE> the women on the show particularly <VOCNOISE> seven of nine <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> there are used as sex objects <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh for the for the viewers <IVER>
yknow she doesn't have to be wearing that tight outfit i think that's for ratings <VOCNOISE> i really do think it's for ratings <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
she wears high heels why would she wear high <LAUGH-heels> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> story elements <IVER>
her forceful personality too <SIL> <IVER>
is <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i mean i don't see any particular reason for her to wear the spandex <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=except> except for to appeal to a <SIL> uh eighteen through twenty five male audience which <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think it does <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> let's watch seven of nine <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> with the the children yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> my favorite character <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> on that show <SIL> had always been chacote <SIL> and i don't like how <VOCNOISE> i don't like how his character has been portrayed in <CUTOFF-r=recent> <SIL> in the <ERROR-recis=recent> couple of seasons <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i liked the fact that he was someone who had been a star fleet officer <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> because of a matter of principle <SIL> uh left star fleet joined the makee but was still <SIL> uh fundamentally an honorable person <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and <SIL> had to deal with being welcomed back into the fold of star fleet <SIL> by being <SIL> uh first officer on the ship but still had to balance <VOCNOISE> his his new life <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i saw so much <SIL> potential for <SIL> uh <SIL> interesting stuff with that <SIL> but i feel that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's <SIL> become just the <SIL> just another character to <UNKNOWN> deliver lines for most of the episodes that i've seen from the <SIL> this <SIL> this past season i stopped 
watching it for a while <SIL> period and then since <SIL> deep space nine left i needed a little star trek fix every once and a while <VOCNOISE> so i started watching it i also don't have cable so ah it's on <VOCNOISE> u p n and fifty three doesn't come in terribly well so <VOCNOISE> um i mean sometimes it's like i don't want <SIL> kind of see what's going on but <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i liked it there's an episode i think it was in the third season where they were stuck on an island <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> island <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it's an island but a planet together i liked it <SIL> there i kinda like and i figure <VOCNOISE> they'll probably hook up but <VOCNOISE> i don't like how the show <VOCNOISE> <SIL> this show and this happened with deep space nine two and <SIL> even with <SIL> next generation for a little bit <VOCNOISE> how the show's become <SIL> soap opera like <VOCNOISE> um i mean the romantic aspects of the stories don't <EXT-really> appeal to me very much <VOCNOISE> um i'm more interested in the social things and yknow good old special effects <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i i think i like <SIL> that how it's kept with a sort of <SIL> i <SIL> tension and it's not <SIL> like <SIL> <UNKNOWN-yknow_I_mean> they're not <SIL> completely thrown together like <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> b'elanna and tom <SIL> which <SIL> i don't like that at all <IVER>
and it's just sort of like uh whenever it comes on i roll my eyes <VOCNOISE> that episode where they were stuck out in space and <VOCNOISE> <EXT-uh> just <VOCNOISE> if the tape can catch me rolling my eyes it's oh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
every week <SIL> i record them <LAUGH-too> <LAUGH> i <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> like x-files <LAUGH> <IVER>
i love that <IVER>
no i don't want them to get together i love the tension if they get together it's dead <VOCNOISE> whenever they get <SIL> uh <SIL> <UNKNOWN> any of there are like five or six examples where it looks like there gonna hook up i mean that one where there's like a <VOCNOISE> a <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> a the duplicate mulder <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> well that guy who can change form <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> in the movie they're about to kiss and <HES-I> i don't like it when they get that close <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i like the <VOCNOISE> how their <CUTOFF-per=professional> their relationship is still professional <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they interact with each other on that level first and they're very good friends <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they have that tension but they don't <SIL> succumb to it and <VOCNOISE> i really like it i just dislike it a little less <IVER>
or <CUTOFF-dis=dislike> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like it a little less or dislike it a little more when <SIL> when it <SIL> it looks like it's gonna come to <CUTOFF-clipping=someu-something> it looks like they're <SIL> it feels like they're trying to tease me <VOCNOISE> as an audience and uh uh i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's not something i feel peased by <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> particularly <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> which one are you <CUTOFF-talk=talking> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it felt innocent to me <SIL> and i liked that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um because all the other times where they started to kiss <SIL> it's always been like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> stereotypical romantic da da da da da <VOCNOISE> and that's like <SIL> wow two friends alone <SIL> it's new years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> perfect <SIL> yknow it wasn't it wasn't like they were gonna jump in the sack or anything like that <IVER>
it was just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i didn't object to that one at all <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i feel that the past season <SIL> the past two seasons really haven't been as strong as the earlier seasons <VOCNOISE> and so <SIL> in some ways i'm <SIL> yknow <HES-I> i <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> i'm not as upset about <SIL> the x-files <VOCNOISE> <SIL> completing it's run as i have been about other shows i mean it's also the simpsons <SIL> final season i've heard <IVER>
ah <SIL> i've heard it it hasn't been as <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I've> I've heard it from <SIL> less reputable sources <IVER>
so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> i love that show i've nearly every episode on tape but this past <SIL> this past season i've <SIL> i've been really disappointed <SIL> with the simpsons <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-wid=with> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
been highly <SIL> critical of of organized religion <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i mean i i think that the stories haven't been <SIL> ah i i mean i'm <SIL> some of my favorite <SIL> like lines from the simpsons is where there highly critical <UNKNOWN> one of my favorites is uh when bart <NOISE> <SIL> the one with where <SIL> bart thinks he loses his soul <SIL> which in some ways is kinda preachy <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> cause i mean <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> lisa takes <VOCNOISE> other positions like ya whether the soul is is real it doesn't matter da da da da da <VOCNOISE> but i love it one scene while they're <SIL> cleaning out the <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well <NOISE> bart and <HES-Milhouse> are being punished they're cleaning out the pipes <SIL> of the organs <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> the the pipes of the organ and uh <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> bart's like there's no such thing as a soul milhouse is like why would they lie to us what would they have to gain and then they <UNKNOWN> it cuts to uh <SIL> <ERROR-revel-reverend> <SIL> reverend lovejoy <VOCNOISE> emptying <VOCNOISE> the uh <SIL> uh <SIL> uh what are they uh the <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> tip jars the <UNKNOWN> the donation thing into a little change counting machine <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't hear cleaning <LAUGH> what would they have to gain <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah it's like what religion are you <LAUGH> oh that one it has all those <UNKNOWN> those great rules <NOISE-that_don't> work out in real life <VOCNOISE> christianity <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> you're happy and you know it clap your hands <IVER>
<LAUGH-Christians> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i <IVER>
i like that aspect i mean i don't know i don't pay attention to who the writers are <VOCNOISE> um so maybe the writing <SIL> has changed <IVER>
south pacific yeah <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
gambling <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i mean <SIL> i want to see how the season ends out it's just <SIL> a lot of the one's this season to me have just been disappointing the <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows <SIL> peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of <SIL> level off i mean the the simpsons had a stretch <VOCNOISE> from like their third year <SIL> through like their seventh where things were just <SIL> like <SIL> unbelievably funny and <SIL> then they had some writing changes i think and this <SIL> this season is just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <UNKNOWN> been <VOCNOISE> completely outrageous story lines <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> like <SIL> the jokes aren't as integrated into the story <IVER>
i mean there'll be <UNKNOWN> there seems to me there more one liners <VOCNOISE> so i'm a little disappointed i'm sad that the show's going off <SIL> the <CUTOFF-th=the> the show's gonna stop but i'm not as <VOCNOISE> sad because the product i'm getting now it <SIL> with the simpsons <VOCNOISE> having it being replaced by futurama which <SIL> ah i find to be <SIL> absolute genius <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> so it's not so bad it <SIL> x-files <VOCNOISE> i'm sad but not as sad based on the past couple seasons when deep space nine went off the <SIL> the air that one really bothered me <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> they even had a star trek replacement <IVER>
still on but uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
um <IVER>
kinda yknow we know but it's <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> what i've <SIL> liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then <SIL> you find out that it's not right <VOCNOISE> and that it's wrong i mean <SIL> there was the episode 
<SIL> uh the two parter <SIL> uh last season where it was <SIL> the advertises full disclosure <IVER>
and <IVER>
what <SIL> and the first episode the first half was <SIL> excellent had the cigarette smoking man just <SIL> it was from his perspective <VOCNOISE> he was talking that then the second half got like <IVER>
oh no <VOCNOISE> and it turns out it was the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the uh the faceless aliens set a trap for the <VOCNOISE> for the guys and <SIL> i didn't like the way it was resolved but i like the fact that it wasn't <SIL> resolved the way that they set it up <VOCNOISE> so i think that <SIL> i mean <CUTOFF-w=we> <SIL> we supposedly know about samantha <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-f=?> <SIL> she's out there somewhere <VOCNOISE> yknow we don't <SIL> have <SIL> again we don't have clear evidence <VOCNOISE> where she is and there were couple times where they <SIL> where we thought we knew where samantha was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> and when there were all those clones of her <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i think that was in the second season or so <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think if <CUTOFF-th=the> <VOCNOISE> if they were gonna end it they were gonna have to have like three episodes in a row that just were tieing up all these loose ends that they keep having <VOCNOISE> i suspect they probably won't do that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they'll <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> leave things open ended for <SIL> future tv movies or maybe another <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> feature length movie <SIL> uh <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and they're also talking about <SIL> cause <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> the actors <SIL> the the reason they're <SIL> ending it <SIL> is because the actors don't wanna do it there was talk i don't know if there still pursuing this <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> they'd have new <SIL> characters <SIL> take over the roles and <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the character development is the most important part i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so i think that'll be a failure but that also <SIL> sorta <SIL> tells me that they're gonna leave things kinda open <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it> <IVER>
they they could've taken <SIL> <EXT-other> <VOCNOISE> i mean well they killed all these people off but <CUTOFF-i=?> they <SIL> could've <SIL> you'll put them into the background <SIL> you have them do a couple of shows a season <VOCNOISE> and then had <VOCNOISE> yknow i don't know the adventures of <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> oh <CUTOFF-S=Spender> <SIL> agent spender and <CUTOFF-w=what> <SIL> the hell what's <VOCNOISE> what's her name <VOCNOISE> but then they they killed off <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all those like <SIL> supporting <SIL> former x-files associated people <IVER>
so they they couldn't go in that direction they'd have to just bring in new people which uh <VOCNOISE> i think it <SIL> probably wouldn't be a good idea <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
i <VOCNOISE> i used to kinda worry about the effect that tv had on me <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i when i was little i used to watch a lot of tv <SIL> i'd come home from school and plop myself in front of the tv <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and watch <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i like yknow four cartoons back to back or so everyday after school or i <SIL> that kind of thing and then saturday mornings it would be uh a block of <SIL> yknow from six in the morning until afternoon <VOCNOISE> or something these days i don't watch <SIL> nearly that much tv <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i don't buy these <SIL> arguments that people make that say that <SIL> like <SIL> children <SIL> are <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> like violence in tv is affecting children i mean <UNKNOWN> i i've seen some <CUTOFF-e=evidence> evidence of <SIL> of <SIL> exercises where in schools the <SIL> kids will watch uh <SIL> like a a violent cartoon like <SIL> i don't know like <SIL> roadrunner or something <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> be a little <SIL> rougher <VOCNOISE> but i <CUTOFF-d=don't> <SIL> i don't <EXT-think> <SIL> that it <SIL> it goes into like values i don't associate like <VOCNOISE> rising crime <SIL> or something with <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> like crime on tv or something i <VOCNOISE> i mean it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if there is a correlation <SIL> i mean i <VOCNOISE> i'm more of the <SIL> yknow like <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> parents have a greater influence on the <SIL> children then tv ever could <VOCNOISE> i mean i <ERROR-laugh=?> watched a lot tv but <SIL> i feel that my parents taught me was right and wrong and <SIL> i watched a lot of <SIL> rather violent tv violent movies all that kinda thing and uh <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
<CUTOFF-y=yeah> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i have become visually desensitized to <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> the violence that i see in movies and on tv <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i still see a distinct difference between that <SIL> and <SIL> real violence <SIL> um <SIL> i mean <SIL> in studying history i'm exposed to a number of <SIL> like <SIL> rather <VOCNOISE> gruesome events in history <SIL> that still <EXT-are> <SIL> <EXT-very> <SIL> i still find disturbing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <UNKNOWN> also <VOCNOISE> hang out in low life bars and every once in a while there'll be a fight and it it still it <SIL> i mean it <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <HES-it> <SIL> it still is <VOCNOISE> disturbing to me i i'm <SIL> i have a distinct difference in my head between <SIL> reality and fiction <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> maybe kids <SIL> like aren't making that distinction but <HES-I> <SIL> <HES-I> i don't think so and i think if if <SIL> someone isn't making that distinction <SIL> it's <VOCNIOSE> i don't know that <SIL> that they're not <CUTOFF-r=?> <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-d=don't> i don't know i don't have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have it <SIL> i feel that i have a distinct <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-distinction> uh uh very clear distinction between what is <SIL> uh <SIL> fact and what is fiction what is <SIL> true and what is imaginary <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> for me i don't think that television has affected me <SIL> in that way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i mean one way that <CUTOFF-tele=television> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> television has affected me <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> i am full of media references when i speak yknow when i'm hanging out with friends someone <SIL> mentions a <SIL> a subject i'm like hey <SIL> simpsons made fun of that <SIL> yknow at some point <SIL> ah <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> that's the effect that it sees on me i don't think that's too big an effect people always used to <SIL> yknow like <SIL> quote <SIL> shakespeare or something i guess that's <SIL> ten times more <SIL> elevated so like oh <UNKNOWN> references that shakespeare line or something but <SIL> i mean it <UNKNOWN> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's a part of our culture and i'm a part of <SIL> it <IVER>
but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't see it as negatively effecting me i still get all the stuff done i need to get done <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> well i found that <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> i mean <CUTOFF-e=every> everyone <SIL> has <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-s=stereotypes> <SIL> people from outside the united states have stereotypes about the united states and when they actually get to know someone <VOCNOISE> <SIL> those stereotypes dissipate <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i actually had a conversation very similar to <SIL> this <VOCNOISE> the other night <SIL> with a <CUTOFF-G=German> <SIL> couple of germans that i met <SIL> at a coffee house <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i mean the <SIL> the stereotype that most <SIL> americans have of germans are those of bavarians <VOCNOISE> uh and not real bavarians but stereotypical bavarians uh <VOCNOISE> beer drinking bratwurst eating <VOCNOISE> sauerkraut eating <VOCNOISE> lederhosen wearing <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow <IVER>
blond haired blue eyed <SIL> overweight people <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah well <HES-I> <SIL> i asked these germans what the <CUTOFF-stere=stereotypes> what stereotypes they <VOCNOISE> like are <SIL> prevalent in germany <VOCNOISE> uh of americans and they said <SIL> yknow americans are cowboys <SIL> and eat at mcdonald's <SIL> three meals a day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> 
<SIL> and <SIL> now it's our turn to deal with the issues <VOCNOISE> we see our parents we see this generation that all these things that are still popular it's that we don't look down on the sixties i mean i <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=think> think the sixties sounded like a pretty fun time to live <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i would get into politics in a second <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> those things are popularized but no we can't do it anymore because we got all these problems <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> aids being one of them <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> politics <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> we grew up <SIL> or came of age <SIL> after the cold war was over <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i'm <SIL> very cynical about this i have a <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-f=fairly> fairly leftist <SIL> uh political <CUTOFF-s=stance> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=stance> <VOCNOISE> uh stance <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
which i feel <VOCNOISE> has been <SIL> <CUTOFF-complete=completely> completely devoiced in america because of the effects of the cold war <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i've inherited this world where there was <SIL> of uh <SIL> uh where am i going with this <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i mean the generation before us had <SIL> like vietnam <VOCNOISE> and protested against it <UNKNOWN> i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> and when it came down to it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean the <VOCNOISE> what was the protest really about <SIL> yknow and <VOCNOISE> i'm not being clear so i'm not exactly sure where i'm going with this i very cynical of <SIL> uh about <VOCNOISE> about the world i've inherited <VOCNOISE> uh cause i see a world in which <SIL> my political views <SIL> have been silenced by <SIL> fifty years of <SIL> of <SIL> you know like international politics <SIL> <UNKNOWN> sort of like <SIL> propaganda <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> that says yknow like <VOCNOISE> to be left of a certain point is bad <UNKNOWN> like among conservative circles the word liberal is is like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> almost like calling someone a communist in <SIL> in the forties <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> where as <UNKNOWN> <SIL> i'm very cynical about that cause it <SIL> they feel that <VOCNOISE> it it wasn't <SIL> it it it's been a cultural process that has been developed <VOCNOISE> and now i'm being handed <SIL> this current situation which i <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=see> see is completely unfair <VOCNOISE> i mean i think the reason <SIL> that our generation is <CUTOFF-cyn=cynical> <CUTOFF-cy=cynical> cynical and the reason i'm cynical <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> because <SIL> we're handed a world <SIL> in which <SIL> we see <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the injustices of the past or <SIL> not the <CUTOFF-i=injustices> the the hypocrisy <VOCNOISE> i mean i guess injustice <UNKNOWN> <SIL> also applies in <SIL> terms of things like <SIL> the cold war and stuff but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's why i'm cynical <VOCNOISE> i hope that answers your question at least a little bit <SIL> i don't know <SIL> i feel kinda preachy <LAUGH> like this is my position <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> the technology <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> like living <CUTOFF-i=in> <SIL> in a world where technology puts everything i need at my fingertips <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i mean <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i think that something that would not have happened had there not been <SIL> a uh <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> a highly <SIL> a <SIL> highly populous generation suddenly that <VOCNOISE> was competing and <SIL> within itself <IVER>
mean i <VOCNOISE> some ways i think <VOCNOISE> competition is a bad thing because in our society it's usually not fair <VOCNOISE> someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> i like the fact that we've got this super high tech tape recorder not a big reel to reel thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a <SIL> a computer internet <VOCNOISE> rather than <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are <CUTOFF-h=here> <SIL> that are not in our library and then <VOCNOISE> where do i go from there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i like being able to look oh <VOCNOISE> library of congress has it <SIL> i'll just drive out to washington <SIL> or have them send it here <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> that i think is a major contribution of the past generation <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
civil rights <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> well i i take the <SIL> extreme position <SIL> that civil rights <SIL> are an illusion <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yeah they're on paper <SIL> which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing <SIL> when <SIL> uh there were laws that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender <VOCNOISE> but i think in many ways <VOCNOISE> it has had <VOCNOISE> little <EXT-effect> <SIL> on creating an equal and fair society <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> some my leftist positions will come out right now <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> people have the freedom <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i believe that based upon where <SIL> where in the social stratum where you were born <SIL> in the united states <VOCNOISE> uh you have a <SIL> a limited ability to move <SIL> upward <SIL> and that the these <VOCNOISE-cla-classes> i mean i <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> i don't want to say class lines because that has so many <SIL> like <SIL> historical connotations cause it's <SIL> not the <SIL> exact same as say class was in the marx's sense <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> class lines still today very much <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> follow race lines <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> what good is <SIL> like <SIL> knowing that you have the freedom to vote <SIL> when you know painfully well <SIL> that <SIL> you are not going to be able to get a job that's gonna <SIL> buy a house <VOCNOISE> for your family and let them live in a relative comfort <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=in> in real terms in things i think are <VOCNOISE> valuable to the individual <IVER>
uh civil rights <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ha=has> <SIL> <CUTOFF-w=went> <SIL> only went so far <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they haven't <SIL> corrected the wrongs of the past they haven't <SIL> uh created uh a a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a sense in our <VOCNOISE> society that anyone can achieve like the american dream in in my opinion is an absolute lie <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
and that the <SIL> the <UNKNOWN> the people who <VOCNOISE> whom most face that lie <VOCNOISE> are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so what <SIL> i mean civil rights was an <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-a=an> an important step but once that step was made it was stopped <SIL> and now i believe today there are <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i mean it <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> see a a growing movement of people who want to <VOCNOISE> who <SIL> curtail the advances that were made <SIL> in the sixties <SIL> and it's not our generation who's curtailing it it's still <SIL> the uh <SIL> like <SIL> our <SIL> parents' generation <VOCNOISE> um <NOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
mm <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
ah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it <IVER>
yeah yeah <IVER>
we have definitely made some progress in that direction <SIL> i still think that there is considerable <CUTOFF-progresh=progression> <SIL> progression that needs to be made <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who's a fellow history major <VOCNOISE> her <VOCNOISE> and actually her brother's a <CUTOFF-fellah=fellow> <VOCNOISE> fellow history major too and a friend of mine i don't know him all that well which <SIL> <HES-apparently> her family <SIL> i mean she's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she's double major in history and chemistry <VOCNOISE> she plans to go to med school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> her parents <SIL> her family supports her in this but they've made it painfully clear <SIL> that <SIL> when <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> she shouldn't plan on having a career because <CUTOFF-i=it> she's gonna hafta raise children at some point which is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's not the way things should work in my <VOCNOISE> <SIL> belief uh and and <SIL> the fact that it's like the males telling the daughter <SIL> like <SIL> this is <SIL> how things need to be i think <SIL> i mean <SIL> yknow i think an <HES-individual> <SIL> individual should have the choice <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i feel i mean <CUTOFF-I=I'm> i'm concerned about a <SIL> a uh <SIL> like this push to the right <VOCNOISE> that's sort of going on hoping it's sort of dieing out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four ninety five but uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think uh uh <SIL> we've reached a point <SIL> where <SIL> because not all of the <SIL> advances <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> have <VOCNOISE> been one hundred percent successful <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the the opposition is <SIL> criticizing the advance <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> and <SIL> and trying to stop it <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> uh i'm trying to think of some <SIL> good examples <SIL> i mean <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> when politicians start talking about like biological functions 
<IVER>
well i live on the south west side and work in dublin <VOCNOISE> i don't get to campus very much <VOCNOISE> i get to campus but it's usually up to the o s u stadium of the o s u stadium <SIL> uh studios <IVER>
yeah i work on the auction <SIL> up there <VOCNOISE> so i sorta avoid the <CUTOFF-ca=campus> <VOCNOISE> main campus <VOCNOISE> it's been a long time since i been around here <LAUGH> <IVER>
uh fawcett center so it's <SIL> it's not even really on campus <SIL> yeah <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> uh okay wait you know where the schott <SIL> is <IVER>
yeah it's over <SIL> <CUTOFF-the=there?> it's on olentangy down there <VOCNOISE> north of there <IVER>
okay <SIL> <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah they did it is warm in here <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and now <SIL> now it's <VOCNOISE> now you <IVER>
uh huh <IVER>
that's fine <NOISE> <IVER>
<HES-um_I'm_um> <SIL> well my title's senior consulting data base specialist <VOCNOISE> work for company called <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> it's in dublin <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i work in <VOCNOISE> it's hard to say what i do i consult on a lot of projects <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
we do <CUTOFF-ah=?> we develop a lot of software and <VOCNOISE> projects and <VOCNOISE> i consult on the data base side <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no we run an online system where people <SIL> <CUTOFF-us=use> <VOCNOISE> connect to our system and build a data bases <SIL> or or access the data bases <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> it's <CUTOFF-da=data> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-din=?> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-da=?> uh <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ev=everything> everything o s u has <VOCNOISE> in their library collection <SIL> is in our system <SIL> their records came from us <SIL> uh-huh <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-th=the?> well they yeah <VOCNOISE> and we do that for <HES-uh> <SIL> tens of thousands of libraries <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
uh essentially all the big academics most the <CUTOFF-U=US> <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-i=it> it's actually <VOCNOISE> all over the world it's international <IVER>
the <CUTOFF-li=libraries> <IVER>
yeah probably cause we have some public systems <SIL> most of them are for the librarians but there's some for public too <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <SIL> yeah we don't have a web browser version that's what we're working on now that's what i've been working on <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <IVER>
<CUTOFF-tha=there> there is a web access to some of our systems when that's all <CUTOFF-la=?> we're <CUTOFF-ma=?> putting a more uniform one up for everything <VOCNOISE> and i don't it may be <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> o s u has some system but they can also connect to our system <SIL> for things they don't have in their system and it's <SIL> so i'm not sure what <SIL> system you're talking <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah and <VOCNOISE> i don't know what o s u's is set up like <SIL> yeah <SIL> they might connect to us they might not <IVER>
it's a lot of the it's looks a <EXT-look> and feel is a lot a lot the same <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yes <IVER>
and your display might be different but it's it's basic information and i and <VOCNOISE> we developed the system that people started doing that on is sharing the data <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> actually it started here on o s u campus and now we're independent <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
no i worked at the library when i was a student <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> actually i <VOCNOISE> that's what got me interested and so i went to library school and <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
uh case western <SIL> cleveland <SIL> you're not from around here are you <LAUGH> <IVER>
well <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh okay <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <VOCNOISE> a lot of exciting stuff going on now at the libraries it's not <VOCNOISE> not the old <HES-yknow> <VOCNOISE> old lady in the bun <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> and the web has really changed that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no i work for the company but i consult on a lot of projects <VOCNOISE> within the company <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> yeah we're doing pretty well it's about a hundred fifty million dollar business <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh thirty <SIL> forty thousand it's international <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah i don't <VOCNOISE> well we just sort of started making a big splash in <SIL> australia in about the last three years <SIL> so uh they they may now they may have <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah they they <CUTOFF-a=all> all of them there's <VOCNOISE> actually other systems too and they all have pretty much the same look <VOCNOISE> but as you said there's little details that are different and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> i've been doing it i've been there twenty over twenty years so <SIL> yeah i'm enjoying it <VOCNOISE> it's always changing <IVER>
oh <VOCNOISE> the technology is changing i mean the web is really revolutionized what we're doing <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> well it's <SIL> anybody can connect to the web <IVER>
uh before we used to have a <NOISE-system> that only people in the back <SIL> room of the libraries connected <EXT-to> and it was <VOCNOISE> all mainframe and then people got p c's <VOCNOISE> on their desk and suddenly the whole world of <VOCNOISE> who could access <VOCNOISE> any system and what they could do on their desk <VOCNOISE> changed <VOCNOISE> uh and now we've gone more out in the public work in the public scene do it's not just for the people in the back room <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and then the web yknow people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with libraries before now we're trying to figure out <VOCNOISE> how do we deal with anybody who just can wants to connect to us <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
most of them that are our site now we have more of a distributed system where we can actually go out and connect to others <VOCNOISE> people <VOCNOISE> connect to us and then go out as a gateway to other places <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> we're <VOCNOISE> getting more into that now <VOCNOISE> but that wasn't easy <SIL> so easy before either the <SIL> yknow the web again <IVER>
then that has changed it <IVER>
no we <SIL> we haven't <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> yknow there's always that <LAUGH> uh but we haven't <NOISE> <IVER>
yeah it can be a problem uh if you get hit <IVER>
know like if our system would shut down it would cost us <VOCNOISE> i don't remember what it is yknow tens of thousands of dollars for every hour <SIL> that we're down <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <SIL> if our data base would be trashed <SIL> our main <NOISE-data> base would be trashed we'd have real serious problems and it could take weeks <VOCNOISE> or <SIL> months to rebuild it <SIL> uh yeah so it could be a problem <VOCNOISE> uh we've got people working in that area <IVER>
wait a minute i don't know what you mean <IVER>
oh <IVER>
uh <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> yeah well librarians traditionally have problems with <SIL> and it's like a form of censorship <VOCNOISE> yknow big brother things <NOISE-librarians> have <VOCNOISE> always had problems with that <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i don't know it's <SIL> it's hard to balance it <VOCNOISE> if somebody's out there actually doing criminal work <VOCNOISE> criminal activity <VOCNOISE> and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you <VOCNOISE> do that and still protect the rights of everybody else it's <VOCNOISE> i don't know how to balance it <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
what do you mean <IVER>
<CUTOFF-ri=right> right right and that <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> and again if it's criminal activity <VOCNOISE> you want <CUTOFF-someon=someone> you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it's <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I'm> <VOCNOISE> i'm not doing anything i want anybody to know about <VOCNOISE> yeah and then what's to prevent them from going and finding out what some companies doing what research is <VOCNOISE> and that's the part that's a threat on the web too is that <VOCNOISE> you can connect in somebody's system and they don't know that you're there and you can see what they're doing if <NOISE-they're> doing research <VOCNOISE> uh yknow developing a new product or something you can <SIL> yeah <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> corporate espionage <VOCNOISE> and i'm sure that's going on and i've heard cases of it <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> and the thing is people are real sharp and no matter what you do they'll find a way <CUTOFF-aro=around> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> nobody's found a way to prevent people from <NOISE-getting> in <VOCNOISE> and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
ah yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <HES-I> yeah i guess so there i mean there people who spend seem to <ERROR-psend=spend> hours doing computers doing this type of thing <VOCNOISE> just going out there and seeing what they can find <IVER>
i know i <HES-do> i do not want to go i don't want to touch a computer when i go home <IVER>
uh no that's okay <EXT-I> ya know don't <VOCNOISE> i just don't want to touch it i just <IVER>
i'd do anything but touch the computer and sometimes it's like six and seven hours a day at the computer and <VOCNOISE> i just don't wanna do it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
no no and <NOISE> <NOISE-whoop> <NOISE> too many wires here got it <VOCNOISE> uh no it's a it's a <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> basically eight five <SIL> yeah monday through friday <SIL> uh just <SIL> i i traveled some and so i had to travel on a weekend so i got to <SIL> ya know comp time <IVER>

yeah i got a son he's a senior at otterbein <IVER>
yeah <SIL> about four five years <SIL> it's not that bad <SIL> <VOCNOISE> how old <SIL> oh that is very young yeah <VOCNOISE> you don't want another one <LAUGH-yet> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-you> <LAUGH-want> <LAUGH-at> <LAUGH-least> <SIL> <CUTOFF-die=diapers> and ya know diapers <SIL> out of the way before you go to the next one <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> it worked out fine for us <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> uh was just the usual thing since she touched my things <LAUGH> ya know because they were far apart enough they had their own social groups <VOCNOISE> they had their own friends and so <UNKNOWN> ya know so that <SIL> and interests so it <SIL> there wasn't much of that but there was the usual ya know <VOCNOISE> she's breathing on me in the car he's humming too loud <LAUGH> i don't know if you've got brothers and sisters but yeah <VOCNOISE> you've probably been you've went through it all yeah well there were five of us and <LAUGH> a lot of that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no no i think with five of em it's just it's more <SIL> more constant <LAUGH> <IVER>
well no well <NOISE-both> kids went <UNKNOWN-through> catholic schools up through eighth grade then he wanted to switch to public school <IVER>
it was columbus <SIL> he went to uh fort hayes <IVER>
um <SIL> pretty good he liked it a lot but it was a big change from the catholic school <SIL> big change <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> he liked it a lot but i don't know if you're familiar with fort hayes it's a um it's um <VOCNOISE> college prep <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE-I_don't_know> they call it alternative school it's called magnet school in most places <VOCNOISE> um <CUTOFF-s=it's> it's college prep <SIL> with an emphasis on the arts and there's some career programs there <SIL> so it was a good good for him <IVER>
yeah and <SIL> uh and a lot of performing arts you were expected to take something in performing and visual arts every year <SIL> <UNKNOWN> uh <VOCNOISE> which is good for him <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> the catholic school he was going to go to was big on sports and my son's <NOISE-not> athletic <SIL> and so this was <VOCNOISE> that's why he <NOISE-didn't> wanna go so this <VOCNOISE> this was a good choice for him <SIL> or that <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> uh i don't know <UNKNOWN> um <SIL> yeah well <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think the teachers are every bit as good as dedicated but i think there seems to be <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> the whole administration up through the board and <SIL> just <VOCNOISE> it's not as focused <SIL> ya know i don't know how to describe it's like <SIL> the teachers are <CUTOFF-sah=sort> sort of <CUTOFF-hae=have> it seemed like they almost had the feeling they're on their own <SIL> where it's more cohesive within the catholic schools like that <VOCNOISE> seems to be very clear they're all going in the same direction and working as a team <SIL> i don't know if you ever listened to any of the uh <SIL> columbus board of education meetings are on the radio <IVER>
uh pretty interesting <VOCNOISE> everybody talks and frequently nobody's listening <LAUGH-it's> it's <NOISE-and> yeah it's it's pretty interesting um <VOCNOISE> talking about how they don't have the money for this and they don't have the money for that and then somebody comes up with <SIL> well let's spend the money over on something else and nobody acts on it then they go on to something else <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
well uh it's like the <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
well you <CUTOFF-ha=how> how long have you been here <IVER>
uh okay <VOCNOISE> well there <NOISE> few years ago there was this big fuss so ya know <NOISE-we've> got to close some schools <UNKNOWN> <SIL> ya know <NOISE-enrollment's> dropping it's <SIL> ya know <NOISE> it's the way <NOISE> population goes <VOCNOISE> enrollment's dropping we can't afford to keep them all going so let's close and they did this big study and they <SIL> targeted some to close <VOCNOISE> well there was a big uproar from the people <SIL> who's kids went to that school <SIL> like there will be whenever you close a school so the board backed down and changed it's mind <SIL> the next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools <SIL> but there wasn't the money for it so there was a big fuss about that then <SIL> two years later they came out with another study <VOCNOISE> it says well they need to refurbish or not <VOCNOISE> some schools close a couple then knock some down and rebuild em <SIL> and it's like every two years it's a different direction and it's like they're almost afraid to take a stand that somebody's not gonna like <SIL> well if you're gonna shut a school down somebody's gonna be really ticked off <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
i my <CUTOFF-s=UNKNOWN> my kids went to a school that <VOCNOISE> well my son had already left it but in <SIL> the fourth grade they announced <SIL> took all the kids in the auditorium and said <SIL> we're closing next year <SIL> and it was hard but <SIL> yeah once it's reached the point that's decision is made and announced and <SIL> i mean there <NOISE-were> good reasons for it <SIL> um <SIL> and they explained the reasons and <SIL> ya know <SIL> at some point <VOCNOISE> you have to figure out how much do you wanna fight something <SIL> when it's inevitable <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well that's the problem i think 
<SIL> school board they're always stopping something and they don't seem to move forward very well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> i don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know if that's what percolates it <VOCNOISE> it's very different in the public schools the catholic school the public school <SIL> you have all the problems of society school you have the drugs you have the absentee <EXT-parents> you have the delinquency <SIL> in the catholic school they just <SIL> you don't have that for one thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh ya know it's oriented around the church even though we're not catholic <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's still oriented as so there's lot of values <SIL> that permeates everything well they don't do that in the public school because if you do that somebody's gonna get ticked off it's the wrong value and <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> why are you doing this to my kid <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> so i think that's missing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's a problem within the school <SIL> the public schools <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so just seems to be more distraction from the educational process know mean when you're in the catholic school and you're in classroom <SIL> they deal with the discipline <SIL> if they need to <SIL> <SIL> course part the <HES-problem> way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them <HES-oh> back to the <LAUGH-public> <LAUGH-schools> <VOCNOISE> uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think <HES-that> <SIL> <HES-it> <SIL> <UNKNOWN> it's harder for the teachers to teach <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> cause there's too much stuff in the way of <UNKNOWN> they <HES-need> <SIL> really they're there to do <IVER>
i don't know i hadn't thought about that <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-I> i don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i don't <SIL> i don't get the impression the values as anything <SIL> <VOCNOISE> to do with what they're doing in the school <IVER>
well i get the sense that if there are discipline problems it's so hard to get anything done <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> solve them unless you unless somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school ya know that's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the big thing now but just that ya know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just so hard to get anything <EXT-done> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they don't see the support <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> throughout through the administration and if they do have <UNKNOWN> <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> they have to wait til something's pretty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> pretty egregious before they <SIL> before it's dealt with <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> they're <HES-UNKNOWN> <ERROR-error=prevented=preventive> from doing much <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah i yeah i just don't think that they <SIL> can do much <VOCNOISE> and i <UNKNOWN> i'm sure it's very frustrating for them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well and i know it is <UNKNOWN> we got friend who's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was a teacher she just retired a couple years ago she's about our age <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <SIL> it's it's very different now <SIL> uh <SIL> you know it's she said it's scary going into the classroom sometimes <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and before it wasn't that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a <HES-UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> know go and get something dealt with it <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now you can't get backing on it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> no <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and she said ya know and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the <HES-word> the last three or four years she just rode it out so she could retire <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and she used be very dedicated <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> uh very dedicated teacher she just <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> it was a job then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <HES-so> i hate see that happen to good teachers <IVER>
right <SIL> right when it's just frustration after frustration <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> but i don't see that in the catholic school now in the catholic school they're not even paid as well as the public schools <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but the environment is <SIL> better for education <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> no <SIL> <IVER>
well my son <HES-started> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah i son started <VOCNOISE> public school for kindergarten <VOCNOISE> and he just <SIL> my son is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my son is a very social <VOCNOISE> <SIL> child we'll say <CUTOFF-he's> <SIL> he's the one that talks too much <VOCNOISE> as the teachers say he's the social <SIL> child <VOCNOISE> he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured <SIL> i mean he needs time to run around but he needs something very structured you get him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> near a bunch of <CUTOFF-kids> other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them cause he was ready to play <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah and <SIL> yeah my and my <CUTOFF-daughter> my daughter's the opposite that <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> but he would do that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> so he wasn't <SIL> he was very <CUTOFF-UNKNOWN> he wasn't <VOCNOISE> learning things <SIL> and he was constantly getting in trouble <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <UNKNOWN> i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we would be told he was a <SIL> problem but he didn't understand what was going on and it <ERROR-wasn't> there wasn't structure he would go to school everyday and not know what to expect <SIL> because there wasn't like <SIL> this <SIL> we'll do this and then we'll do this and we'll do this <VOCNOISE> so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it just was a better <CUTOFF-match> better match for him <SIL> and then <SIL> <ERROR-error=when> my daughter <SIL> went to school was just easier to take them to the same school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-and> and that goes back <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about why the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> discipline and <SIL> and behavior may be different in the catholic school is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're paying big <SIL> you're paying bucks <SIL> yknow it's four <CUTOFF-thousand> <VOCNOISE> forty five hundred dollars a year for <SIL> us <VOCNOISE> to send her to school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> and if we find out she's not doing her <SIL> work <SIL> it's <SIL> very different <LAUGH-perspective> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i think she's getting a better education than he did but <SIL> it's because she's doing the work and and she knows she's expected to has to and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he <SIL> my son's the kind he'd rather play than work and so he <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he rode a lot and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> and he and he paid for it when he got to college it was rough <CUTOFF-start> for him to start out because he was behind then <IVER>
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> no mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
oh they have religion they have a religion class they have religion everyday but some of it is just starting with prayer and bible stories and some it's more the values <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh lot those teachers aren't catholic <SIL> which <ERROR-ahvah=I i was surprised to hear that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh in fact the religion teacher that my daughter had in ninth grade she had religion class everyday wasn't catholic <IVER>
<SIL> <SIL> yeah i thought that was interesting <SIL> uh so <CUTOFF-it> it is a values <SIL> yknow <SIL> the the <UNKNOWN> christian <SIL> values thing <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i don't have problem with we had little problems like my son had to learn the hail mary <VOCNOISE> and we had to find somebody to teach it to us <VOCNOISE> write it down for us because we didn't know and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they wrote it down wrong so he learned it wrong and he got marks off <LAUGH> and we and we didn't <LAUGH-know> yeah little things like that <VOCNOISE> but it wasn't a problem <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> there was a problem <VOCNOISE> with my son for a while because the priest they had there wouldn't let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion <VOCNOISE> and that's pretty much the priest decides that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he <SIL> and he felt <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> singled out <SIL> and he was i mean he was the only one <VOCNOISE> and he was uncomfortable with that <SIL> uh <SIL> but it hasn't been a problem <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm <SIL> not a religious person myself <SIL> but i'm not against it <SIL> and if i <HES-and> <SIL> maybe i've justified it to myself by saying well they're teaching values <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no well he right now he's really interested in eastern religions i'm not sure where that came from <VOCNOISE> yknow when they go to college and they're gone and you don't see them much <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> that's what he's interested in right now <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i don't think it it it it really took <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <SIL> <ERROR-error=yeah> and <SIL> <HES-and> <HES-and> if my daughter doesn't seem ah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we have talked about some things that are <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow the pope says this is <SIL> what is and <SIL> knowing full well that this is not what we think at home <VOCNOISE> we <SIL> abortion and homosexuals and <VOCNOISE> we're <ERROR-fwer=if much more liberal than that and <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> <CUTOFF-clipping=it_just> that's where there's been a problem but we're very open about that at home <CUTOFF-clipping=and_with> with <VOCNOISE> my daughter is strong willed <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well no she sort of knows this is what she <CUTOFF-has> has to say at school <VOCNOISE> if she's asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade <IVER>
but she doesn't believe it <VOCNOISE> yeah yeah she's very pragmatic <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-yeah_she> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I_mean_she> she could probably <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well she's she's interested in physical therapy <SIL> is that what your wife is <LAUGH> oh <LAUGH-okay> <IVER>
and so you had <IVER>
physical therapist did it yeah <NOISE> <IVER>
but it fixed it <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> drugs <SIL> right <VOCNOISE> yeah so that's what she's interested in right now she's looking to see if she can find someplace to <SIL> work this summer <SIL> even if it's just a day a week <VOCNOISE> some clinic or something just to <SIL> to see whats goes on day to day <IVER>
why's that <IVER>
<NOISE> really <IVER>
you mean instead of a doctor 
<IVER>
huh <IVER>
i wonder if that's also socialized medicine there <SIL> it is socialized isn't it <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> yeah my best friend lives in <VOCNOISE> on <VOCNOISE> outside canberra <VOCNOISE> and she has a lot of medical problems but <SIL> huh <IVER>
they're covered but it was real tricky because she sort of had some of she was a u s citizen <SIL> she fell in love through email over the internet <SIL> back in the early <SIL> like nineteen ninety it was real early <VOCNOISE> and went over there and married the guy <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> and so she had some of the medical problems when she emigrated and <SIL> <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> uh it was just <SIL> it took years to get that straightened out <VOCNOISE> but she's covered now <NOISE> <IVER>
hm <IVER>
it's medicare type thing <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
and as <VOCNOISE> more and more people are getting older and older there be more <SIL> need for it <LAUGH> it be a lot of things there's gonna be more need for as people get older <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
tests <SIL> uh yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> well and i think chiropractors will be <VOCNOISE> more popular for the same type of reason <SIL> yeah <SIL> huh <IVER>
i uh i've gone to one but i had a back problem that's how <UNKNOWN> dealt with it <VOCNOISE> and it worked <IVER>
the same thing yknow i think they're terrific <VOCNOISE> for the right things <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
oh okay <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh you don't ask an easy one do you <LAUGH> that's a that's really <IVER>
yeah that's i mean that's really a tough one <VOCNOISE> uh because it's <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and yknow i don't think it's violence on tv <VOCNOISE> i don't think it's working parents i think <EXT-it's> <SIL> and i don't know what it is <VOCNOISE> it seems to be something more pervasive than <SIL> could be solved easily <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <SIL> <HES-I> i don't know it's a tough one and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> i mean your daughter <SIL> uh you said <SIL> daughter's yeah <VOCNOISE> is still young so you have to deal with but is scary <VOCNOISE> you send your kid to school and you hear these things and it's just <VOCNOISE> no matter where it is in the country or the world <VOCNOISE> you hear of it yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> really worries you <IVER>
<HES-well> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm very <SIL> much in favor of gun <VOCNOISE> control very strong gun control <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <UNKNOWN> i it they just seem to be too available <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <SIL> but then some of the things that the schools are doing about it <SIL> know the kid who comes to school with a paper gun gets <SIL> suspended that's <SIL> a little much but <IVER>
i don't know i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper <VOCNOISE> he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out <IVER>
and was threatening kids with it <SIL> and so they suspended him <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> it's it to me that's sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you've done it what the kid did and you don't want him to do it again and let it go <VOCNOISE> they suspended him i don't know <VOCNOISE> course <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um i probably say this <VOCNOISE> i got this version of the story from the columbus dispatch so it's probably not the whole story <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> it it is <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> and if you want something local that's all you <UNKNOWN> got <VOCNOISE> i mean there's one paper <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't even read it much <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> it's very conservative very republican <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
then there's <VOCNOISE> probably columbus it's <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> it's the democrat <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah franklin county usually votes differently than the rest of <VOCNOISE> at least the metropolitan areas of the state <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh okay <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well and it's not just in the schools it's in society <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> i mean violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things <VOCNOISE> and i <EXT-it's> <SIL> i i just <SIL> can't <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it's> it's hard to imagine that the <SIL> there's an easy fix if there is a fix i <VOCNOISE> it's kinda frustrating because <VOCNOISE> you can't point to one thing and say this is what needs to be fixed <VOCNOISE> yknow it's pervasive <SIL> <HES-uh> it's like the <NOISE> i don't know if you've heard about this in the news a woman <SIL> two of them were having an argument and one of <VOCNOISE> one of them set fire to the other one <IVER>
it was real close to my home <LAUGH> <IVER>
it's the grocery we <LAUGH-use> <LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no i haven't been over there since then <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> but it's like <VOCNOISE> i mean you <SIL> there's these stories almost everyday you hear them <SIL> and that's <SIL> i mean that's even a big change from five or ten years ago <IVER>
or maybe it's <SIL> well <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> or maybe it's crime that's going down in the sense that it's supplying <VOCNOISE> yknow it's <VOCNOISE> criminals aren't as active but there's more and more of these <SIL> acts of violence <VOCNOISE> maybe it's because they're so dramatic <SIL> that you notice it <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah i mean maybe break ins are down <LAUGH> <SIL> or holding up seven elevens are down but <SIL> then you hear these yknow <SIL> murders <IVER>
and then they seem like random or just spontaneous <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's no way <CUTOFF-wa=?> nothing you can do in life to really avoid it except <EXT-hide> <VOCNOISE> hide in your basement or something <SIL> and that's <UNKNOWN> yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and that's not a life <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> and you <CUTOFF-n=?> got it walking down the street <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-uth=?> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there seems to be an awful lot of <SIL> publicizing some of it i mean some of it's pretty dramatic a woman setting fire to somebody what happened in columbine <SIL> it's very dramatic but <VOCNOISE> when it happened in columbine it was <SIL> all that was on the <EXT-news> <SIL> for a whole <SIL> day <CUTOFF-i=it> <CUTOFF-see=seemed> seemed like you <SIL> anywhere you looked <VOCNOISE> that's where it <NOISE-was_this> thing <NOISE-is> <SIL> <NOISE-coming> loose a little <SIL> there <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and that's <SIL> all you could see and it was like <SIL> well how much do <EXT-you> <SIL> how much new is there to say from minute to minute on every channel <VOCNOISE> how much do people really need to keep hearing it <IVER>
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lotta places they pick something that's sensational <HES-and> <SIL> keep <CUTOFF-m=?> <SIL> they're making it <SIL> even more sensational like <SIL> when <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> john kennedy died <IVER>
fortunately we were out <SIL> we <VOCNOISE> weren't <SIL> in the country so <SIL> we didn't know so <SIL> we had <SIL> heard just <IVER>
well we were uh <VOCNOISE> we weren't that far we were in vancouver so it's not that far away <VOCNOISE> we didn't hear about it for a couple days but i heard that that's <SIL> all that <SIL> was on <VOCNOISE> every aspect of his life every aspect of the search <VOCNOISE> did people really need to know that <SIL> do they need to have it driven <EXT-home> <VOCNOISE> and i think in <CUTOFF-ih=?> and i think at that point that's where the media are just <SIL> they're sensationalizing it <HES-and> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <SIL> everyday <VOCNOISE> <EXT-everyday> <VOCNOISE> there was something <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> it's like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i felt felt like i knew more about clinton's sex life than i knew about my own <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow_it's_about_the> <LAUGH> and it was far more then i wanted to know about anybody else's <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> where as yknow in the past there's been presidents who had affair the press never even acknowledged it even if they knew it <SIL> i mean at least that's what <SIL> ya 
we hear <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and now that's <SIL> the most newsworthy story out there <VOCNOISE> so i think yeah the press have a lot to do with it <SIL> the media <IVER>
well hide in your basement i guess <VOCNOISE> and <CUTOFF-I=I'm> i <CUTOFF-m=mean> but i mean what <VOCNOISE> you can <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not as an individual <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well see that's a problem <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> it's hard to find a balance between censorship and <SIL> yknow free flow of information <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and as long as people <VOCNOISE> i mean some people <VOCNOISE> like this information uh <SIL> jerry springer's still running <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> which i i actually kind of enjoy watching <LAUGH-once_in_a_while> when i get the <CUTOFF-ch=chance> <VOCNOISE> it's kind of <VOCNOISE> interesting to watch these <EXCLUDE-people> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but i mean <VOCNOISE> i mean where do you draw the line what people should see and not see <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i don't want somebody telling me i can see something or telling me what my kids can see <VOCNOISE> uh i that's my job <SIL> and if i don't wanna see something on tv i'll turn it off <SIL> if i don't want my kids to see something on tv <VOCNOISE> we'll i have an argument <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> it used to be easy when they were little yknow now <LAUGH> yknow <VOCNOISE> you're dealing with a a twenty one year old an eighteen year old is not as easy <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
you're much bigger <VOCNOISE> and you can control the thing and keep it away from her <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> yeah but <VOCNOISE> but i don't want somebody else telling me what <SIL> they can watch and not watch that's my job <VOCNOISE> but i don't know how you i mean the <SIL> the media <ERROR-per=?> supposedly i mean <VOCNOISE> may <VOCNOISE> not supposedly this may be the way it works the media presents this stuff and people watch it or read it <CUTOFF-ju=just> <SIL> or whatever they don't <VOCNOISE> but it's when it's like the constant barrage that this is what you get <VOCNOISE> the monica lewinsky stuff and <VOCNOISE> every day there was a new twist on the story that <VOCNOISE> or they announced that the news was that there wasn't a news twist <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> i don't care <SIL> but you couldn't turn it off because that's all that was on <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
well they are now in a sense <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> it's easier to <SIL> to go somewhere else i think on the web on tv if you have yknow like <VOCNOISE> four news <CUTOFF-cha=channels> <UNKNOWN> four local news channels and they're all saying the same thing <VOCNOISE> and emphasizing the same things there's no <SIL> choice there if you want the news you're gonna get it one way or the other but on the web you can go somewhere else <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and yknow major newspapers are all over the web <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> you can pick and choose and you can see different <VOCNOISE> perspectives on the same story from different parts of the country and <SIL> i think you get a a wider view <SIL> yeah <IVER>
well yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh that was the monica lewinsky <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think it's been good i mean the economy has been very good <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> it seems like society seems to be <VOCNOISE> improving <VOCNOISE> yknow even though we talked about this <IVER>
crime and stuff <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the republican years and carried over <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but people have been better off financially <VOCNOISE> overall <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> and i and i don't think he's made anybody i don't i wouldn't say he's made any <UNKNOWN> major mistakes <VOCNOISE> policy wise well <SIL> yes the <VOCNOISE> his personal life <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> he's well <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
he's really just <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <SIL> yeah he just doesn't think through the implications of things real well in his personal life <IVER>
well <SIL> yeah he does back down too often <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> you uh <SIL> well <SIL> yknow the well the health insurance didn't have a chance <VOCNOISE> i mean <CUTOFF-i=if> <VOCNOISE> no matter what position he took on the health insurance trying to radically change things it wasn't gonna get through congress <VOCNOISE> and so yeah he backed down but i would've liked to have seen something else happen to it <VOCNOISE> but it was also he i mean he gave up because it was <SIL> it was useless to fight it <SIL> he didn't think it wasn't gonna get through congress <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> why spin your wheels on that <SIL> i mean he raised the issue <VOCNOISE> it was clear that it wasn't gonna go anywhere <VOCNOISE> and maybe it'll <CUTOFF-c=come> <VOCNOISE> it's i think it's regrettable it hasn't come back <SIL> yeah but <SIL> he's <SIL> pretty much out of the picture now <VOCNOISE> as of this week <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the gays in the military <VOCNOISE> i mean they've always been there <SIL> <LAUGH> i really <VOCNOISE> uh they've always been there <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i don't have problems being around gays <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i never have my <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> have a brother in law who's gay my <VOCNOISE> son's godfather's gay <VOCNOISE> it's not a problem <SIL> um <IVER>
oh clinton's position on it <VOCNOISE> well he sort of backed down from what it was gonna be and then <SIL> just hoped that it would drop and <SIL> i mean what <VOCNOISE> what you hear and read lately is that it really hasn't changed much <SIL> uh <SIL> and it but again that's i think part of that too is society's not ready <SIL> on some level to accept that <SIL> i mean gays in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gay marriages and <IVER>
well uh <IVER>
was it was <SIL> they actually had a law or they <SIL> or was it referendum <IVER>
oh really <SIL> i hadn't heard that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> know it it uh <VOCNOISE> some of it when clinton has backed down i think i <VOCNOISE> sorta summarized what i just said is <VOCNOISE> yknow for the health <VOCNOISE> insurance and reform with that <SIL> all that health insurance <VOCNOISE> area <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yeah he backed down but it wasn't gonna happen <SIL> so he could keep <SIL> know the furor going for months and months or years <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> still nothing was gonna happen it was the wrong time <SIL> or <CUTOFF-mo=move> try to move on to something else <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i think it's regrettable it hasn't come back <VOCNOISE> like you said it's like <VOCNOISE> well i made the one attempt and didn't go anywhere so let's let it drop and <VOCNOISE> count for somebody else to pick it up well <VOCNOISE> clinton's in <SIL> lame duck it's <VOCNOISE> why can't he bring it back <IVER>
it's a good <CUTOFF-ti=time> i mean what are they gonna do <VOCNOISE> i mean he's been through enough hell on his personal life this can't be much worse i wouldn't think <VOCNOISE> uh and he does <CUTOFF-ba=back> he does back down i think too much on stuff like that <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's a <EXT-long> time <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> if they can't say it in three months they can't say it in eight months <IVER>
oh george oh <SIL> w <VOCNOISE> i don't know i haven't <VOCNOISE> really formed an opinion i can't <IVER>
i can't see a lot of substance <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then <VOCNOISE> sorta <CUTOFF-ba=backtracks> <UNKNOWN> not really backtrack it's just like it's not anything really firm <VOCNOISE> i mean with mccain and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was what <SIL> the points they wanted to make and that <SIL> i don't hear that coming from bush <IVER>
well i don't <SIL> i hear some of that from gore but not as much <IVER>
it'll be a <EXT-long> campaign <VOCNOISE> i thought it was interesting that <VOCNOISE> that gore suggested <CUTOFF-that> <CUTOFF-reco=recommended> suggested <SIL> two <CUTOFF-campai=campaign> two debates a week and i just can't imagine <VOCNOISE> watching two debates a week for months <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow> it's like <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> at least they could get things out into the open but <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> they have the chance but who wants to watch that much <VOCNOISE> who has the time to watch that much <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't think we need eight months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries it's just <SIL> too long <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> people start tuning out <VOCNOISE> and there's only so much you can say <VOCNOISE> yknow it's like the candidates 
<SIL> aren't really saying much new where if they have a more compact time they could be so i'd like to see them <VOCNOISE> see the time reduced <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the conventions used to be interesting because they debated the platforms and <VOCNOISE> that's all settled now <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> and it's just sort of a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow the celebration type stuff well that's not <SIL> interesting <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> they couldn't change and move the primaries <SIL> like to may <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well that's it's competition to be earliest and the <CUTOFF-st=stupid> <VOCNOISE> the federal government's trying to stay <SIL> stay out of the state's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> face and <VOCNOISE> so again that's another one of those things that <VOCNOISE> just live with it i mean there's enough of there's enough things to do and fight in were it life but that's not worth it <VOCNOISE> ya know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's <VOCNOISE> probably what i'll do ignore it <CUTOFF-ti=till <CUTOFF-un=untill till like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> august or july and then start paying attention <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> wait right <UNKNOWN> the amount of money that is spend is just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i could just can't imagine <VOCNOISE> uh ya know millions and millions have been spent already <SIL> hundreds millions and <VOCNOISE> it's just starting <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
my background <IVER>
<UNKNOWN-what_do_you> mean <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i grew up in columbus i was born here <VOCNOISE> uh went to went and here at <SIL> o s u at <CUTOFF-sch=school> <VOCNOISE> for school as an undergrad <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i went to columbus public schools <SIL> uh didn't <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um um <SIL> always over on the west side same area of town <VOCNOISE> always lived there <CUTOFF-s=since live there now <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> came up here to o s u <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> got my bachelors in uh <SIL> english lit <VOCNOISE> and then went to case <UNKNOWN> western reserve for a masters <VOCNOISE> then i decided i wanted to go somewhere else in the country <VOCNOISE> after i got my library degree <SIL> and the only job i could find was here in <LAUGH-Columbus> <IVER>
it was a <CUTOFF-ti=tight <VOCNOISE-it> was real tight job market for librarians then <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-hell_yeah> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well it's good now <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> well the web again has changed that there's <VOCNOISE> computers <VOCNOISE> have made a big difference <SIL> uh it's more exciting now <VOCNOISE> for people who in that area um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> who are interested in <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's more emphasis on <SIL> information not books and <VOCNOISE> things <CUTOFF-a=are> going to the library it's <VOCNOISE> getting the <CUTOFF-infor=information> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
making information available so it's <VOCNOISE> i think it's attracting a different group of people and it's <SIL> it's <SIL> more interesting <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but it was real <VOCNOISE> <SIL> tough job market then so i ended up at the state library downtown <SIL> <VOCNOISE> worked there for five years and decided i <CUTOFF-ha=had> <SIL> wasn't anything else there for me <VOCNOISE> uh and got a job at this company <EXCLUDE-name> which was still relatively new there were like <VOCNOISE> hundred hundred and fifty employees <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> was in seventy eight <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and then i've just <SIL> i have <VOCNOISE> stayed there and it's <VOCNOISE> grown a lot and the work changes it's an interesting place to work because <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well first the job is almost a different job every year <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because so many changes are happening we're trying to stay out in front of what <VOCNOISE> in front of what library innovations in front of web <SIL> and net <ERROR-innervations=innovations> and trying to incorporate it all so it's <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> ya know it's <SIL> kind of exciting because you're <CUTOFF-i=in> getting in on things that are really new and <VOCNOISE> trying to master it the project i'm working on now <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> it's trying to find a way <CUTOFF-s=so> <SIL> to automatic to <SIL> create data that describes <SIL> web resources <SIL> so that libraries can take this data and put it in their catalog and integrate it with the regular collection <VOCNOISE> and we're doing a lot of <VOCNOISE> with a <SIL> yeah it is it's pretty <SIL> it's pretty neat project a lot of new things <VOCNOISE> who at <SIL> uh java and the web <LAUGH> give us <VOCNOISE> opportunities do things that we've talked about before but <VOCNOISE> couldn't really do very well <VOCNOISE> so it's pretty neat <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> well we didn't even have computers <IVER>
at our desks we had terminals that connected to a system <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah it was <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and ya know you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and isn't very ya know it was very slow and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> key in a few characters and send it and wait and <UNKNOWN> much different now <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
very different <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> just been a lot of innovations and <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> mm-hmm <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> my first job over here at the o s u main library was key punching <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
for the system they have now key punching the old card data into that <SIL> that was my first <SIL> first library job <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> i started at the real bottom of it <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> and i don't <CUTOFF-rea=really> <IVER>
uh it's <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> you just sit at the computer and <VOCNOISE> key the data in or <VOCNOISE> well the system we're doing now is you can put in like <VOCNOISE> um the address the u r l for a web resource <VOCNOISE> it goes out and extracts data analyzes what's there <VOCNOISE> and comes up with <VOCNOISE> ya know subject terminology and call numbers and <SIL> presents it back to you and then you can edit and do whatever you want with it <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> ya know it's <VOCNOISE> it's doing some of that <VOCNOISE> some of that the automatic assigning and <SIL> subject headings and call numbers that's <VOCNOISE> that's a lot of <VOCNOISE-re-research> we're doing a lot of research on that it's <VOCNOISE> got a ways to go it's getting better <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it's i mean it's a lot better than it was even a year ago <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well we put all kinds of information out on our own website <VOCNOISE> which there's so much it's very hard to find what you want <SIL> ya know it's <VOCNOISE> that's a constant problem with information is <SIL> the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want <VOCNOISE> but if you can't get to it <VOCNOISE> if it's not out there you can't find it <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> it it's a problem for us and for libraries because there's just a barrage of what they're getting and it's not just from us it's from the literature <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> there's literally <CUTOFF-do=dozens> <SIL> ya know <VOCNOISE> hundreds of library publications <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and it's a problem that <VOCNOISE> librarians are facing all the time they can't keep up <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
there's too much information and too much change <VOCNOISE> uh librarians <VOCNOISE-se-seem> <SIL> and this is against probably of the image of librarians are they're very <VOCNOISE> very <SIL> eager to embrace change <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> internet came out and <SIL> ya know <SIL> and when it <SIL> and when it got out of the area that was being used by universities or whatever for research that's what it was at first <VOCNOISE> librarians were right there they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they could do with it <VOCNOISE> um when p c's <VOCNOISE> we didn't <SIL> you know it was revolutionary when we announced we were gonna use i b m p c's <VOCNOISE> for access to the system and we provide you software you can do some of the work that you used to doing but <SIL> with us <VOCNOISE> in your computer <VOCNOISE> and it's like it was incredible that <SIL> i mean <SIL> we had trouble with the demand it was <CUTOFF-f=fantastic> <SIL> ya know like triple what we expected <SIL> librarians were ready for it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah make their job earlier and faster <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> ya know and <CUTOFF-librarian=librarians libraries like <SIL> so many other places especially at universities or <VOCNOISE> they've seen budget problems and <VOCNOISE> the subscriptions for <CUTOFF-seriou=serious> <VOCNOISE> periodicals are just outrageous <IVER>
some of those <VOCNOISE> triple every year <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah they do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well that's what <VOCNOISE> that's what they've done <SIL> well they've done that here too they've done every university <IVER>
well <IVER>
right but the ones that are raising are the ones that are the standards in the fields <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> right <SIL> and but more and more those are also available <SIL> on the web but you have to subscribe to them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so it's still and institutional subscription <VOCNOISE> i mean that's a constant problem for the serials people everywhere i mean <VOCNOISE> just it's incredible what's happened with the costs <SIL> ya know <SIL> i mean i've seen <SIL> articles that say some of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year <IVER>
but if you do that to <SIL> ten things it's some but it's in <SIL> integral to the university's collection <VOCNOISE> that really hits your budget <VOCNOISE> ya know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then there's always the professor who wants a particular journal because they like it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that you really didn't need <VOCNOISE> because then you could get more bang for your bucks <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah we do a lot of inter library loan too <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's it <IVER>
oh okay that was easy <IVER>
yeah it was easy <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah it was yeah it was interesting <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i usually don't have trouble <CUTOFF-talki=talking> 
<EXCLUDE-four_five_six_seven_eight_nine_ten> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is that <VOCNOISE> just to get a volume level <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
excuse me <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-you_didn't_screw_it> on right and <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> okay <IVER>
um-hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <LAUGH-okay> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
here in columbus yeah i've <CUTOFF-aw=always> i've always lived in columbus yeah <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> west side <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
eh <SIL> not really <LAUGH> he's kind of between the west and the south area southwest yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh the area i live in's uh now is the west gate area <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh we grew up on the hilltop area <SIL> right now i live in the west gate which is a little further west <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's gone downhill a lot <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-yiy=yeah> yeah they uh near <CUTOFF-uh=west> <SIL> near west side is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> always been in <SIL> pretty bad area well in the last forty or fifty years and it's starting to creep west <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> into the hilltop area <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
we were just talking about that last night my wife and i been thinking that another five years we might wanna get out of here <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> we're buying it yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and we should have it paid off about five years so <SIL> we're talking about moving someplace <SIL> a little simpler to take care of <IVER>
a condominium or something <VOCNOISE> one floor plan <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah it's seventy years old <IVER>
um <SIL> so there's always something going wrong <SIL> with the wiring or the plumbing or the something <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> it seemed like a good idea about twenty five years ago to get a house a <SIL> older house <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh no not anymore <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i've uh one son nineteen <VOCNOISE> he's trying to find himself <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's been a lot of uh <SIL> a lot of problems with him he's a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> brilliant kid <SIL> uh they told us in elementary school he had the highest i q they'd ever had tested <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's very creative uh <SIL> very talented musically <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he was taking lessons from um <SIL> gene walker that teaches jazz saxophone here at the university <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he said that he thought charlie had the makings to be a <CUTOFF-profess=professional> to make a living <SIL> career as a jazz saxophonist <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh but there's <SIL> also in the last four years or so a lot of uh mental health problems <IVER>
<ERROR-creep=crept> crept up multiple <SIL> health problems <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he ran away for a while there was drug abuse <VOCNOISE> alcohol <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh he was essentially asked to leave high school <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> uh and he went to columbus alternative which is considered one of the <SIL> top high schools in the state and he was asked to leave <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um he <ERROR-wims=was> in a psych ward for a while <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> in some ways he's seemed to have gotten it together <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh he's working full time at united dairy farmers <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he's involved with an uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> very much involved with uh having a baby in another month <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh well not <VOCNOISE> not really she's only sixteen and he's nineteen she <VOCNOISE> <SIL> quit high school the end of ninth grade <SIL> uh within a few months had her g e d <SIL> is filling out forms now to start <VOCNOISE> go to college in the fall <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> in becoming uh an engineering <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> tech <VOCNOISE> she's looking at two or three different areas so i'm <VOCNOISE> not sure which uh she can't convince him to <CUTOFF-gi=get> he says he needs the g have a g e d <VOCNOISE> but he <VOCNOISE> hasn't done anything about <UNKNOWN-I_don't> <SIL> think he <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we've always had the feeling that he had a uh um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a fear of failing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because he was so good at anything that he really wanted to do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that the areas that he was not good at <VOCNOISE> math for <UNKNOWN-per> instance is an example <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he just got very frustrated with and just wouldn't try <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh he's very talented he's had artwork published <SIL> poetry published <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he's won <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he won a statewide award <SIL> a gold medal for <VOCNOISE> bagpipe playing <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's doing none of that anymore <VOCNOISE> so it's very frustrating for us and the baby they're giving up for adoption <VOCNOISE> so that's a <VOCNOISE> whole different <SIL> problem <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> not really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh he's come to accept it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but uh it was her decision <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah it was one thing to know that it's the best thing for the baby <UNKNOWN-kid> but it's another thing <VOCNOISE> my wife and i are trying to deal with emotionally that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we're very family oriented <VOCNOISE> that this is a grandchild we'll never <SIL> get to see watch grow up and that's very hard on us <VOCNOISE> but it's is an open adoption <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh they've met the couple several times <SIL> uh they've promised to ya know send pictures and keep <SIL> keep them updated and stuff like that so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <UNKNOWN-uh_they> <UNKNOWN> uh westerville <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's difficult for us to deal with <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and and i'm gonna hold you to this confidentiality cause <VOCNOISE> very few people know about this <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> my brother knows about it and my mother and that's the only ones in my family that are even aware of it so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> we just don't wanna be bothered with a lot of questions <IVER>
<SIL> cause it's hard for us to deal with <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-n=no> <SIL> no this all started long before that actually <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just recently he seems to <SIL> have accepted the idea that yes the baby's gonna be born i i think he just kind of <SIL> tried to ignore it for a long time but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> it's all very obvious now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and she's <VOCNOISE> she's great <IVER>
we really like her and she has helped us straighten him around a lot <VOCNOISE> he has been under a psychologist's care for about <SIL> three years <SIL> and a psychiatrist for about a year and a half <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> she's very bright she's very <CUTOFF-di=different> she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her um <SIL> parents divorced when she was about four <VOCNOISE> her mother's an alcoholic her father said that he would <SIL> take her <CUTOFF-w=with> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> with him and then after they got divorced he changed his mind so she's pretty much raised herself <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-et=it's> it's a <HES-big> <SIL> it <VOCNOISE> it's terrible things what she's <LAUGH-had> to go through <VOCNOISE> and she's made it very clear that <SIL> she will not live with an alcoholic <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that's helped straighten him out some <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and our feeling was never that <SIL> the alcoholism or the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the drugs <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was not the problem <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> and we've dealt with several counselors and that's all they wanted to deal with our <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-prom=problem> has always been it's a symptom <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> took the psychologist a year and a half but he finally <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-agre=agreed> <VOCNOISE> charlie is <VOCNOISE> he's very intuitive <SIL> and <CUTOFF-eh=even> even as a toddler he could do this he <CUTOFF-wu=would> <SIL> he'd <SIL> seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from him <IVER>
as a toddler and it's <SIL> it's not intentional it's just the way he is <VOCNOISE> so he was able to circumvent anything that the psychologist was trying till he had finally admitted it yeah he had a problem <SIL> and then things went much more smoothly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and that there's still not <SIL> really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> convinced of the diagnosis cause there's multiple problems and <VOCNOISE> they haven't ruled out that some of the other things yet <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he could he just knew how to get around anything <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah it it's <SIL> it's <LAUGH-difficult> <LAUGH> <IVER>
to deal with <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> he was tough but he was uh he was always tough and we didn't realize it for years we didn't have anything to compare to he's the only one kid we got <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh he was <VOCNOISE> very <VOCNOISE> the psychologist told us that <VOCNOISE> ya know we were talked about things that happened when he was growing said you must had a terrible time <CUTOFF-gra=growing> <SIL> <UNKNOWN> raising him cause he was not an easy kid we didn't know any different <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> was our job <IVER>
so we <LAUGH-did_it> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's well he's always had some problems it's <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> his problem's staying focused on things <SIL> unless it's something he's extremely interested in then you can't get him away from it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> if it's something he <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> just an example in school he would sit there and <VOCNOISE> he'd be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they're trying to teach something in class or <CUTOFF-spe-supposed> <SIL> working on a writing assignment or something <VOCNOISE> and half hour to work on it he'd be <SIL> the last five minutes <VOCNOISE> the teacher say you know you really need to get that done he'd <SIL> sit down and write it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-in> the fifth grade he was writing on a college level and <VOCNOISE> he'd could do it that quickly <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think he's lost ground on that now but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and that was just an example in the second grade <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the school he went to was an open classroom <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he had been through some couple the traditional schools already <VOCNOISE> and the <SIL> <EXCLUDE-the> principal said we had told the <CUTOFF-pren=principal> talked to the principal about the problems we were having with him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> staying focused and she said well we can work with that well <CUTOFF-ha=halfway> about halfway through the year she says it's not working <VOCNOISE> and they have an arrangement and with <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> i doubt if most the <CUTOFF-p=people> <SIL> people in the <CUTOFF-schoo=school> parents in the school are even aware of this with childrens hospital <SIL> the counseling center they set a room aside and they <SIL> send counselors in once a month to work with the students <VOCNOISE> it's open classroom <VOCNOISE> it's experimental so there's people coming and going all the time and no but how we were never aware of it i i doubt if most the people are aware of it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they met with us and then a week later they went and observed him <SIL> and <SIL> he was they were <SIL> the teacher was telling a story and then asking questions about <VOCNOISE> and said he was <SIL> the counselors said he was up and walking around and running around and <SIL> playing with his shoes and stuff like that she said but if came time to answer the questions he knew every answer <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so he said he that they decided not to precede at that time because <VOCNOISE> this is frustrating too <VOCNOISE> it was our wedding anniversary and my wife said now how about for our wedding anniversary <SIL> we just get a good report for the whole week <VOCNOISE> but that was unusual <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he wasn't <SIL> a bad kid <IVER>
he's just disruptive <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <SIL> he said <SIL> okay <SIL> week later she said we didn't get any bad reports thank you and he said she said are you gonna continue he said yeah it's a lot easier <SIL> for the rest the year we got no bad reports from <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> first grade <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed and but the principle wouldn't let her give it to him <VOCNOISE> to give him something had to do what everything anybody else in the class was doing <VOCNOISE> he was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it <SIL> the last grading period she'd give him <VOCNOISE-sh-she> everyday she'd give him a <CUTOFF-m=math> math <SIL> paper to work on and he said i showed you i <SIL> i know how to do this i'm not doing it <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> we were up talking to her almost daily <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> on the phone in her office <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the ya know the last week he <CUTOFF-sd=said> she said you know there's only one week of <SIL> school left she said well i better do my work and sat down and did it <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> extremely difficult to deal with <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and he had been through a counseling experience before and it <CUTOFF-jih=just> and it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he just played along with it then <SIL> to get out of it i think that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he does <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> his love <CUTOFF-fuh=for> <VOCNOISE> he <UNKNOWN> <SIL> he <VOCNOISE> his music is extremely good he <SIL> taught himself so he by ya know <SIL> sixteen he's playing eight instruments <SIL> very well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh he just <SIL> and he can't do that now where he lives now he lives with <SIL> uh this <EXCLUDE-is> another thing that boggles my mind <VOCNOISE> his uh <VOCNOISE> girlfriend's mother she he's afraid her <CUTOFF-girlf=girlfriend> his girlfriend that her daughter was gonna run away so she let's them sleep together in their house <SIL> <VOCNOISE> when she her daughter was fourteen <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
it's a little hard to accept <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i <CUTOFF-thing=think> <ERROR-s=it's> it's it's hard to know what he's going through <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <ERROR-wa=what> how much of it <SIL> <EXT-is> <SIL> um <SIL> normal <SIL> teenage rebellion <SIL> and how much of it's just 
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-h=he> <SIL> and plus the mental health <SIL> aspect of it and everything <IVER>
and some of that's controlled with medication now but <SIL> not all of it <SIL> because they because of the drug and alcohol they won't put him on some of the medications so <VOCNOISE> but as far as i can tell he's been pretty clear and clean on that end uh <SIL> yknow like <SIL> once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she's taking very good care of herself she uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she <SIL> lately has been going with him to the psychologist <SIL> and oh <SIL> uh we've been paying for it but we don't have a problem with that <SIL> because he's <LAUGH-going> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> he likes the psychologist so <VOCNOISE> took a long time to get to that point but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> so we've been talking to the psychologist about it and he said this should be <SIL> <ERROR-she=he> he said <SIL> most people that raised in that background he said they go two different ways ones they <VOCNOISE> they just fall into the same <SIL> uh pattern as their parents or they're survivors she appears to be a survivor <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> she's never really had <SIL> what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us <VOCNOISE> uh which i'm glad <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and she we really like her she's <SIL> really <SIL> it <SIL> we enjoy being with her but <SIL> sometimes more than being with my son <VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
so it <SIL> it's been very difficult <SIL> for us particularly the last four years and <SIL> about the time he ran away <VOCNOISE> was er between the time my father in law died and my mother in law died which was in a five month period so my wife's had an awful lot to deal with <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she's had a lot to deal with in that time <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> plus a lot of work stress that she's had and stuff <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh she works at franklin university she's assistant vice president there <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so there's been a lot of pressure there <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> every time she thinks she's got it fully staffed and everything covered somebody quits but uh <VOCNOISE> and that's what the main problem's been <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i retired about uh four years ago <VOCNOISE> from the state i worked there for thirty years actually i started working for the state when i school here <SIL> i worked here <VOCNOISE> and that <CUTOFF-c=counted> <CUTOFF-f=for> counted <CUTOFF-f=for> those five years counted towards retirement so i was able to retire early <VOCNOISE> and then the last uh about the last two and a half years i've been working the symphony <SIL> in the box office <SIL> started part time and then i was full time for a while and then <VOCNOISE> i requested to be cut back to part time again <VOCNOISE> because uh <IVER>
i don't need to work that many <LAUGH-hours> <LAUGH-what_the> <SIL> <LAUGH-I_mean> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <SIL> right i didn't need to <SIL> so i didn't want to <VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'm fifty two <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i was forty eight when i retired <VOCNOISE> so it's great <SIL> it's terrific <IVER>
uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> all those years and <VOCNOISE> after i left at school <SIL> here i was at the bureau of employment services i worked for about uh <VOCNOISE> twenty years <SIL> with uh <VOCNOISE> research and statistics labor market information uh federal state programs collecting information on <SIL> three different programs in that time <VOCNOISE> then i worked for about a year and a half on a special project <SIL> uh <SIL> they were automating the employment services activities and they were going in a complete different <CUTOFF-der=direction> direction to match um <SIL> job needs of employers and <SIL> applicants <VOCNOISE> to <VOCNOISE> to get <SIL> <VOCNOISE> more placements for interviews and that sorta thing <VOCNOISE> and i developed <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> method the the mechanism that check lists and stuff i did uh <SIL> worked on that <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and i worked for the last three years in jobs training <SIL> uh for economically disadvantaged youth adults and dislocated workers <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> the <SIL> uh <SIL> technical assistance and policy end of it <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> hated it <VOCNOISE> the other years were fine but those last three were pretty bad <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-y=yeah> oh yeah <IVER>
and they are actually offered an early retirement because the funds <VOCNOISE> i don't <CUTOFF-re=remember> <SIL> you may not remember about three years ago <VOCNOISE> four years ago the <SIL> the federal government was not gonna pass a budget and all this stuff so when that doesn't happen on budget <ERROR-UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> cuts in at seventy five percent of what the previous year budget was or something like that <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-which_was_actually> more money than they were gonna give us before that <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> so <SIL> they had to <CUTOFF-d=do> <VOCNOISE> they would either have go lay off people or offer retirement <VOCNOISE> so i took the retirement <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because i was not happy there anyway <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> then <SIL> took couple months off and did some consulting <SIL> was worked on a consulting project at a borden's for <SIL> about six months <SIL> <VOCNOISE> then when that project ended <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> same time it ended my <SIL> father in law was diagnosed terminally ill with cancer <VOCNOISE> and he needed daily treatments here in columbus and they don't <SIL> they were from chilicothe so <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i became his caregiver for about three months till he died <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then took a couple months off and started working part time at the symphony <SIL> <VOCNOISE> have been since then <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
answered an ad in the paper <SIL> uh <SIL> but i've sung in a <VOCNOISE> well shawn sings in the symphony chorus too <VOCNOISE> i've sung in it for sixteen years <IVER>
um <SIL> so i just you know was something i was a little familiar with anyway <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i was just looking for something part time <IVER>
so it worked out well <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it is really is <LAUGH-not> <LAUGH-it_really> <VOCNOISE> it really is great <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i just haven't enjoyed it you're right yeah before that i was fine if i ever still it if i i made a mistake by applying for that one job i just wanted to get something different because i didn't wanna go back where i was well i would've been better off back where i was <VOCNOISE> i would've been better at the job for one thing <VOCNOISE> and i knew uh knew <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> kind of insanity i'd be dealing with there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh uh <IVER>
yeah yeah i applied for it and went after it aggressively <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i was good in the <LAUGH-interview> <LAUGH> i mean <VOCNOISE> i knew what i was doing i kind of wish i hadn't been as prepared but <VOCNOISE> uh <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but it was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a lot of the <CUTOFF-peop=people> i moved into a management position <VOCNOISE> i was in it was a lateral move wasn't even a pay raise or anything it was a lateral move <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the people that i was supervising some of them been doing it for twenty years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they made it very clear to me that <SIL> they knew the program and i didn't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
and uh <SIL> and <CUTOFF-y=you> you know i was there for <SIL> three months before i got hit with a <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-ra=race> <SIL> <HES-race> discrimination suit and <VOCNOISE> but then i found out later this woman had <VOCNOISE> in the twenty years she been there had filed twenty suits so <VOCNOISE> 
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE=brrr> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she couldn't <CUTOFF-uners=understand> accept the fact that you could just disagree with her <VOCNOISE> it had to be because she was black or she was an older woman or <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you couldn't just disagree <VOCNOISE> had to be a reason there <VOCNOISE> but fortunately <CUTOFF-m=my> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-shuh=she> she accused me of that in front of my boss who was black <SIL> who <SIL> didn't believe it <VOCNOISE> he knew better so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah it did and then she <CUTOFF-tuh=?> <VOCNOISE> but she was <VOCNOISE> kind of a gossip she went around talking to everybody trying to get them all support her and nobody would support her <IVER>
they'd uh heard it all before and they <UNKNOWN> <SIL> some of them had known me for a few years <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i was told <ERROR-lafter=after> i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there than anyone else <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i don't believe <LAUGH-that> <LAUGH> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i wasn't i was in <CUTOFF-manager=management> for about thirteen fourteen years and it wasn't bad where i was before <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> this management it was it was the whole department it was uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know what it was people they were always arguing and fighting it was just the whole <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> atmosphere like of that place and it was just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> people that i'd known for years and gotten along well with were just <SIL> they were different when they went in there they just changed it was just <VOCNOISE> it was just not a good place to work <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i think there's been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i really think <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> even though i <SIL> would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking him away from the <CUTOFF-otha=other> <SIL> the cousins <VOCNOISE> i mean they've the cousins have been stressing all along he needs family he needs family well there's not much closer family than your father <VOCNOISE> and that that that they love this country and this stuff well then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> accept the laws and follow them whether you <LAUGH-dont> agree with them or not <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-th=think> <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i it was very unfortunate the way it happened uh but i think the government should <SIL> <VOCNOISE> not <UNKNOWN> let it go on as long as it had <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
its the way i feel <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-wah=we> <VOCNOISE> we were talking about this at work one day and they said you know i'm <CUTOFF-su=surprised> <SIL> surprised you think that way because <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> tend to be a little left of center on most things <VOCNOISE> sometimes far left but <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i said now this isn't <VOCNOISE> i she said <VOCNOISE> seems like that would be the conservative view my opinion the conservative view is <VOCNOISE> they don't want him to go back to cuba <VOCNOISE> not to the communism or <VOCNOISE> but people i've talked to even <VOCNOISE> extreme conservatives <SIL> and liberals they all pretty much feel the same way that the ones i've <CUTOFF-ta=talked_to?> i haven't heard anybody <IVER>
that's accepted the other <VOCNOISE> the cousin's side yet <IVER>
right <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> yeah but it <VOCNOISE> the conservatives and liberals are all agreeing on this <IVER>
that's what <IVER>
i <VOCNOISE> it's not a presidential <CUTOFF-iss=issue> candidate issue as far as i'm concerned but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah <IVER>
even my mother who is a <VOCNOISE> she said if nixon were running today she'd vote for him she's that much of a conservative <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> agrees with what's happened <VOCNOISE> but most people will say the same thing there should have been another way to get him out of there but <VOCNOISE> at this point i don't think there really was <SIL> a <VOCNOISE> a few months ago yeah but <IVER>
i think the news media have hyped it up too much really <VOCNOISE> i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that's <VOCNOISE> trying to escape from cuba to united states that's found at sea is immediately returned to cuba <VOCNOISE> whether you agree with it or not <VOCNOISE> that's the accord and that's what <CUTOFF-kee=?> that's what <SIL> castro's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's the premise he's operating on <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> you know and the news media they haven't really been <SIL> a <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ji=just> <VOCNOISE> they just <SIL> they haven't been real objective about it <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> you know like there two fisherman that <SIL> found him at sea you never hear about the other one because that this was on one <SIL> just briefly i heard on the news because <VOCNOISE> he thinks he should go back to his father <SIL> but you don't hear about him <VOCNOISE> there's three cousins two of them think he should stay <VOCNOISE> miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you don't hear about him <VOCNOISE> i was reading about him <VOCNOISE> news week or someplace <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> so i think the news media is not been <VOCNOISE> totally objective about this <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh sure <IVER>
i'm sure <VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
it's it's <SIL> it's more a <VOCNOISE> it tends to be more of entertainment <VOCNOISE> i don't remember that being that way thirty years ago but <SIL> it does now <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> that's something i've noticed in the local news particularly <ERROR-latrih=lately> they say exclusively on our channel and stuff <SIL> and it's usually not that big of a deal what they're talking about uh but they're making a big point that you heard it here first and <VOCNOISE> i mean if you hear it five minutes earlier on one station than another what difference does it make <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'm just kind of appalled what they put on the news anyway it's not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> usually what i consider news <VOCNOISE> it's lot a human interest stories and things like that which <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> nationals getting that way too they're all heading that way anymore <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> used to be an <SIL> analysis with the news you don't get that at all anymore <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> kind of the u s a today syndrome <IVER>
light news <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's why i read <VOCNOISE> tend to read the alternative newspapers and things because you do get a <SIL> different perspective it's <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> probably just as slanted <VOCNOISE> but it is different <VOCNOISE> you're right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh usually whatever ones i can find uh <VOCNOISE> hey you got <VOCNOISE> columbus alive and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just not quite that <IVER>
yeah the local ones more than anything <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<SIL> <VOCNOISE> oh no never have <IVER>
years ago there was a <CUTOFF-citiz=citizen> i don't know if you were <UNKNOWN> what your background is where you <CUTOFF-we=were> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ih=?> <SIL> were here but or not but <SIL> citizen journal was a daily paper <VOCNOISE> and it was <SIL> it was the opposite of the dispatch <VOCNOISE> was much more liberal <VOCNOISE> they used this and <SIL> it <SIL> it was a morning paper and the dispatch is an afternoon paper <VOCNOISE> evening paper <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> they shared the same facilities <VOCNOISE> the same printing presses and everything and then dispatch <SIL> when their lease expired wouldn't renew their lease <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and at least it gave you a lot different <SIL> view <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh but the dispatch <SIL> the only reason i get the dispatch is i do wanna know what's going on locally <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you <IVER>
right you <VOCNOISE> you you can't really ignore <VOCNOISE> i've heard people say i refuse to read the dispatch well you got to know what's going on locally i'm sorry <VOCNOISE> but uh <IVER>
the day your trash is picking up <VOCNOISE> what movies are playing <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but i don't really rely on heavily for news <IVER>
even they don't get facts right a lot of time <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh not very right on <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i would <VOCNOISE> twenty the twenty years the first twenty years i worked at the bureau <VOCNOISE> i was worked in statistics <SIL> so i learned a lot about <SIL> numbers and how to use them and <VOCNOISE> what you can do with them how <SIL> easily they're misinterpreted <VOCNOISE> and my wife <VOCNOISE> does it it has been a director of institutional research at the university <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> data <SIL> research <SIL> uh uh <VOCNOISE> they don't really have other kinds of research there <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
and she says <SIL> it's amazing you can <VOCNOISE> give these <CUTOFF-pep=people> give people numbers <SIL> and they immediately <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> use them wrong <VOCNOISE> they just don't know how to use them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh they <VOCNOISE> completely misinterpret even though it's very clearly stated what they're doing <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> the newspapers do that a lot too <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
people want a number <SIL> they don't wanna know the methodology that goes into it <SIL> or the the disclaimers or footnotes <SIL> they don't wanna read the footnotes they want a number <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> when i worked for the state one program we worked on was uh occupational employment statistics which was collecting uh <SIL> numbers employees by different occupations in different industries in different areas <SIL> of ohio <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> which actually used <SIL> originally started here the university in ohio it was a federal program department labor it was administered state level <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> it didn't <SIL> didn't turn out very well so they switched it over to me <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for a variety of reasons which is not entirely the university's fault <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they had to rely on confidential information which we couldn't give them because it was confidential <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> by federal law it was confidential we couldn't give it to them <SIL> but they needed it <VOCNOISE> so it <CUTOFF-ju=just> it was just not a good one <SIL> good way to do business <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and we would present information ok there <VOCNOISE> for <CUTOFF-ins=instance> <VOCNOISE> there's this this number of people in an occupation <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> but there was also a range of error on there where people wouldn't notice that <VOCNOISE> and they would take that number as gospel <SIL> and you just could not convince them that <SIL> well it really means more than that <VOCNOISE> uh the big one would be uh wage levels and we didn't really <VOCNOISE> at that time collect wage data so if we were kind of a conduit for <VOCNOISE> there's several different departments in the <SIL> the state <SIL> and the federal government collect <VOCNOISE> occupational data and we were kind of a conduit for the state for that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> people would they wanted an hourly rate they didn't want a range they didn't want <VOCNOISE> they uh they wanted a number and that's what that was gospel <VOCNOISE> but it's based on survey data so and and you know there's always statistical error in there and stuff <SIL> and <SIL> try to explain that to we spent more time <SIL> uh <SIL> when people call up and give information explaining <VOCNOISE> <SIL> this is what this really means then the just giving them the number <SIL> that we spent more time doing that <SIL> uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think a lot of people don't <SIL> understand <VOCNOISE> a lot of people don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a mindset <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> they don't wanna deal with <SIL> numbers a lot of people or they want something easy and simple <VOCNOISE> and that's what they're looking for <SIL> they don't really wanna know <SIL> what it means <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and a statistic under <VOCNOISE> any <SIL> <CUTOFF-ter=term> uh any <SIL> definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind <IVER>
and people <SIL> don't seem to understand that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh it's not like you're <SIL> collecting data for a hundred uh the the entire population of the entire universe you you're working with a sample trying to <VOCNOISE> represent the entire universe well <SIL> sometimes <VOCNOISE> it's good and sometimes it's not <IVER>
they tried sampling <VOCNOISE> well my brother rich was one of the families they sampled <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and it just didn't work <IVER>
and uh and the <SIL> data they collect is just <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> well i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but <VOCNOISE> the basic <VOCNOISE> <SIL> data has essentially how many people live in the household and what are their ages and race and that's it <VOCNOISE> and that's not a <SIL> i don't think that's a big secret myself but <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> i think <SIL> uh some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh <VOCNOISE> is is <SIL> colored by the fact that i collected data <SIL> for twenty years from <SIL> employers <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i'm a lot more sympathetic <SIL> to that sort of thing <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah just lot more sympathetic to people collecting data <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i had did one time <IVER>
i had somebody call and they were doing a survey and they wanted know what i did for a living and when i told them they said well we're done <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-we're> we're finished <LAUGH> 
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> oh sure <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> oh <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's not enough <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah and <HES-UNKNOWN> and I think it could work <SIL> uh but I don't think people were <SIL> ready to accept it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and if <SIL> the people <CUTOFF-filli=filling> giving the information aren't ready to accept it then <SIL> <IVER>
it's not gonna work <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> I'm not sure <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I'm not sure that the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the federal government has the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ability to convince enough people <SIL> to do it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and I don't think it's I I think the people that are going to be <SIL> ready to accept it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> go with it are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I don't think <EXCLUDE-you're> gonna get a <SIL> good cross section population <SIL> I think the people would be willing to understand it and go with it more if gonna be the more educated in this sort of thing then you're leaving out a large part the population so I'm not sure it's gonna give valid results anyway <SIL> <IVER>
period <SIL> and it's that's a long process I mean this has been going on for two hundred years this way <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and people are suspicious of government <SIL> asking questions <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah and you just you just send that right on over but if you don't want to tell how many people live in your house <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> see checking to see what kind of things you're ordering where you're <VOCNOISE> hits are on the inter net <SIL> and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> that's just because it's in the name of government <SIL> they're suspicious and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> difficult you feel alone a lot of the time <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and I'm not as liberal as I used to be <SIL> uh <SIL> it's I think <CUTOFF-someb=somebody> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> with age it gets tempered a little bit <SIL> but still <SIL> <VOCNOISE> tend to be a little more liberal and it's uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know <SIL> it doesn't matter who I vote for they're gonna lose <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and I just stay out a lot of <SIL> <LAUGH-discussions> <VOCNOISE> was <CUTOFF-interest=interesting> my <VOCNOISE> our mother raised us <SIL> in a way that we were always allowed to discuss <SIL> politics and religion anything we wanted to <VOCNOISE> uh but you know she'd stop if we got to <EXCLUDE-the> point where we were <VOCNOISE> getting physical or name calling or something like that and it was <VOCNOISE> long <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> after I left home I actually before I realized that not everybody's <LAUGH-that_way> <VOCNOISE> not everybody wants to hear your views <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so I <CUTOFF-ih=in> particularly around my in laws they're very conservative <SIL> of southern Ohio <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> raised during the depression <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> in a depressed area <SIL> so it <SIL> I've learned <VOCNOISE> my mother in law <VOCNOISE> <SIL> took anytime you disagreed with her as a personal attack on her so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I just learned <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're not to say anything <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> uh <SIL> my father in law wasn't that way but my mother in law was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> I think <IVER>
I think they do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN-who_knows> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> my uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my brother in law was very much opposed to any kind of gun control <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh the whole family was hunters hunters and things like that and now my <VOCNOISE> father in law was a hunter <SIL> but he was not opposed to gun control either <SIL> uh <SIL> as long as he could hunt <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <SIL> and they're not the kind that would go out and just shoot any animal <UNKNOWN> shoot it they would <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> use it food they sometimes they <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I know one time that <SIL> they gave it to a family that was uh didn't have any money and didn't have any food they did <SIL> went and killed some animals and gave it to and I don't have a problem with that <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> but my brother in law was very much opposed to <SIL> any kind of gun control <SIL> he <SIL> he believes whatever Charleton Heston tells him <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh I think that <IVER>
I 
think that that you with all the violence in the schools and that sort of thing I think people are starting to look at it a little differently <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah and it's not <VOCNOISE> I mean it gets it <SIL> any is too much but it's not that big a proportion that it's happening <VOCNOISE> but I remember even my son the third grade somebody kid brought a gun to school <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
he went to Columbus schools uh <SIL> uh <SIL> and the kid didn't know what he had he just found it laying around <SIL> his father's car in the <SIL> glove compartment <VOCNOISE> brought it in to show the other kids <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> that was very upsetting to my son he's very sensitive <SIL> uh <SIL> he used to be <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> again I don't know if that's normal for teenagers or not but he used <VOCNOISE> used to be very sensitive to other people and <SIL> but uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I don't think I <VOCNOISE> I don't know if he is or he just doesn't <SIL> won't let him be himself be right now but <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> and that's normal we understood that we <ERROR-ka=came> knew we knew a lot of stuff we were gonna <VOCNOISE> we raised him to be very independent <SIL> and I always said that we're gonna regret this someday <VOCNOISE> I said another ten years we'll be pleased but <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or I to be very independent <VOCNOISE> uh so it gets to point that <SIL> when we were first married pretty it was hard to make it simple decision on anything <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> yknow we've worked through that after twenty five years but <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> or to stand on our own or anything but <SIL> you know we learned to do it but <SIL> we always he was always very independent <SIL> <VOCNOISE> his teachers said <SIL> independent we said it said stubborn but <VOCNOISE> it's like even <SIL> go to Mcdonalds or something and he was <VOCNOISE> didn't want onions on anything he <SIL> if he ordered a <SIL> a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as <SIL> six and seven years old and <SIL> and tell them <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> which <HES-we> we encouraged that <IVER>
because we could know that <SIL> he'll need that someday I would never have done it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but it uh he he would he's <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and he's very opinionated <VOCNOISE> and it's interesting when he talks about <SIL> uh <SIL> anything <SIL> he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> you can tell that he's thought he's uh thought about it <SIL> and his <SIL> yknow clearly formulated what his stance is on it <VOCNOISE> and he's <SIL> very articulate about it <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> sometimes <SIL> his responses are immature but he's nineteen <IVER>
I mean <VOCNOISE> I'm sure at nineteen I was saying some really bizarre things too <VOCNOISE> uh but you can tell that he's thought about it <IVER>
so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because he and I always discuss <SIL> politics and stuff <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he had <CUTOFF-va=variety> <VOCNOISE> a variety <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> eighth grade is when he was probably in some ways his better year <SIL> uh <SIL> he was taking a <CUTOFF-com=computer> <SIL> had taken computer class for grading period <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it wasn't going well they were teaching keyboarding well he learned that when he was in third grade <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so we were talking to the teacher about it says well he's disruptive he's supposed be doing keyboarding exercises and he's writing programs <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> so anyways <SIL> and he said I knew the first day he was in here he knew every <CUTOFF-th=thing> thing that I was gonna teach this <UNKNOWN-couldn't_do_anything> <SIL> grading period well that <SIL> kind of flew up a red flag to me and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> can you give him other assignments <VOCNOISE> oh no he's got do what everybody else is doing <VOCNOISE> so we went to the principal and <SIL> I was <SIL> president of the <SIL> uh parent's advisory committee at the time so I had an easy access to the principal <VOCNOISE> he took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library and the librarian worked <SIL> with him one on one teaching data base and spreadsheet <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> applications to him <VOCNOISE> but then <SIL> but he had another teacher in the ninth grade who contacted us his english teacher <VOCNOISE> and <ERROR-he=she> she <CUTOFF-se=said> said told us uh said he knows everything I wanna teach <VOCNOISE> so I want your permission to give him a separate curriculum and she did she but he was <SIL> using reading books like invisible man <SIL> my <CUTOFF-e=Ellimon> <SIL> Ellimen Ellison <VOCNOISE> Ralph Ellison <SIL> and Ellimen guess it is <VOCNOISE> anyway um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and writing papers on it he was reading like three books by an author and then trying to write a short story in that author's style <VOCNOISE> and she still tested him with the other kids just make sure she hadn't missed any he hadn't missed anything <VOCNOISE> and she was he was using her grad school notes to write papers and stuff like this <SIL> and uh <SIL> it was <SIL> he loved it <VOCNOISE> and that's what he needed <VOCNOISE> though when he got to high school <SIL> and we would talk to teachers about they said no they couldn't do that <VOCNOISE> uh it was very frustrated <SIL> frustrating <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
in the kin <IVER>
in uh <SIL> first grade his teacher <SIL> knew that he needed that but the principal would not allow her to do it <SIL> and that's one reason we put him in different school for second grade <VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah and uh <SIL> in the eighth grade he took the ninth grade proficiency test and passed all four parts <SIL> the first time <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> so he was learning what they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> were <SIL> teaching which and that's another problem teaching to a test but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> that's a whole different problem <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <IVER>
right <IVER>
and you learn what you have to to get through the test course I did that <SIL> when I was here at school <IVER>
uh <SIL> if was a class I <SIL> knew I had to take I didn't really want to <VOCNOISE> that's what you do <VOCNOISE> uh you just get through it <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
I was bored in high school and I wasn't all that bright <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh he needed <SIL> that but uh if I uh <IVER>
it it was difficult <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I can't tell you how many times he had papers or projects due at school that we'd just have to sit there with him to keep him focused on doing it <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> one of the <SIL> uh diagnosises probably <VOCNOISE> A D H D which has trouble <VOCNOISE> with uh working memory how and how to get a project done and stuff like that <VOCNOISE> uh we taught him how to do time lines and <VOCNOISE>  <ERROR-gat=got> charts and things like that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but it was very difficult for him be task oriented <IVER>
and it still is <VOCNOISE> uh and that was the problem with school he just wouldn't do the work <SIL> I mean he give him a test and he could pass it <VOCNOISE> do really well but <SIL> he just wouldn't do the work <SIL> <IVER>
well he wasn't really diagnosed then until just the last couple years uh <SIL> and part of the problem was it was fairly new and everybody was being diagnosed A D H D uh and it wasn't really there weren't really good screening instruments for that there are now <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> and we've often felt that he needed to have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> gifted <VOCNOISE> emphasis for gifted children because <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and the uh <SIL> the schools wouldn't do that for him because his grades weren't good enough because he didn't do the work <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <SIL> the state of Ohio's definition of <SIL> a gifted child is uh anyone who goes scores seventy percent or higher on <SIL> some test that they give <VOCNOISE> well uh yknow they saying half the students in Columbus schools were gifted students now that's not <SIL> it can't it's impossible <VOCNOISE> gifted students there's fourteen different characteristics to look at you can't just look at <SIL> one thing <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> one of them they'd looked at in columbus was <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> how well he was doing in school <SIL> well gifted children you <SIL> <CUTOFF-ofte=often> have the high uh one of the highest drop rate of <SIL> out rates in schools they're not doing well <VOCNOISE> so they need to be taught differently <SIL> and then they cut this moneys uh <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-mu=my> my feeling is you know there's lot of <UNKNOWN> programs in school there's sponsored by the federal government particularly <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh to help the the students are that are behind and that's important <IVER>
and it should be important but there needs the students that are the other end need the help too <VOCNOISE> lot of people think if you have a child that's gifted that all your problems are solved but it's not it's a different set of problems there's personality quirks that go with that emotional issues <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
and the they're not willing to do that for gifted students <IVER>
only if for those <UNKNOWN> students who are <CUTOFF-achu=acheivers> high achievers who are very bright <VOCNOISE> talented may be truly gifted <VOCNOISE> who are willing to <VOCNOISE> jump through the hoops <IVER>
and those the and the other students were lost <VOCNOISE> to the system <SIL> and that's what happened with him <IVER>
and and it's just <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well we figure in a few years he will <SIL> um <IVER>
that's what we figure in a few years he'll be fine <SIL> it's just getting there <SIL> it's been very difficult <VOCNOISE> I mean there's times when we didn't know where he was <SIL> for <SIL> a week at <CUTOFF-tay=time> a week at a time he <VOCNOISE> I was driving <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lane avenue once and saw him begging money on the street and <SIL> that's <SIL> it's it's hit pretty heavy load to go through it really is <IVER>
right <IVER>
no I had no idea where he was <SIL> uh and at the time <VOCNOISE> my mother in law was in a nursing home had Alzheimers and my father in law was in the hospital <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh essentially dying <SIL> and so we were dealing with all of this <VOCNOISE> at the same time and it was I mean there was one night I remember we were ready to leave the hospital about seven thirty we checked to see if there was any messages at home to see if we'd heard from him <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and got a message that my mother in law had fallen and she was in an <SIL> emergency room the same hospital fortunately so went down there <VOCNOISE> then on the way home <SIL> got a phone call on the cell phone <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> from the hospital that my father in law had to had some bleeding so we had to go back to hospital <SIL> and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was all and this was not unusual <VOCNOISE> it was a horrible period <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> I think what <SIL> made my wife and I the angriest was that he's the only one that really could control his behavior the others couldn't <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and their needs were <SIL> immediate <IVER>
he's admits now that he felt neglected at that period <IVER>
well <SIL> how he felt and knowing that weren't neglecting him were two different things <VOCNOISE> we've always emphasized that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> knowing what's right <SIL> or knowing that <VOCNOISE> what's just is one thing it's dealing with the emotions is another one <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> like dealing the with this adoption of the baby we know that that's best but dealing with the emotions of it this is a you know it's grand <VOCNOISE> we're very family oriented <VOCNOISE> and it's this is a grandchild we'll never see <IVER>
and it's very hard on my wife and I <SIL> but we'll get through it <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> it's uh well you're right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes <SIL> so it's tough to go through but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he uh I guess he always did take things a little on the extreme <IVER>
so it's <VOCNOISE> probably wasn't unexpected we just weren't prepared for it I don't think you could be prepared for it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right and he just pretty much <SIL> cut ties with all of his old friends and <VOCNOISE> we still see them all uh a lot <VOCNOISE> and we were close with their parents and <IVER>
hasn't for about four years he refuses to <VOCNOISE> refuses to live with us <VOCNOISE> because we have rules <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he seemed confused <SIL> parenting with controling <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> I mean we would like when he was fourteen years old we wouldn't let him go out and take a walk at <CUTOFF-el=eleven> three in the morning and he couldn't understand that <LAUGH> I'm <LAUGH-sorry> <LAUGH> I don't think that's being <VOCNOISE> a bad parent <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to tell you no <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <IVER>

<IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and he did that too <SIL> uh <IVER>
no and he <IVER>
yknow he had he had <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he <VOCNOISE> was living with this one family for a while <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they were nudists and taking him to nudist camps and stuff like this <UNKNOWN-and_I_thought> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-wa=what> <SIL> what do you think they would <VOCNOISE> they never had any contact with us they just let him move in <VOCNOISE> can you imagine letting your <SIL> fourteen year <EXT-olds> friend just <SIL> move in <SIL> and not <SIL> find out why or <LAUGH-anything> <IVER>
i just <VOCNOISE> he uh he did <VOCNOISE> talk to one of his friends who <SIL> he wasn't really a <CUTOFF-w=?> did <CUTOFF-wa=?> didn't really know that <SIL> this friends mother and i grew up together <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh so he was <SIL> he <SIL> asked if he could move into their house and the mother said there were three things <SIL> one i need something in writing from your parents <VOCNOISE> two i need to talk to your parents <VOCNOISE> and three there are rules you'll have to obey <IVER>
of course that never happened <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i think he really does <IVER>
uh yknow he's paying rent at his mother in law <SIL> <HES-as> wasn't not really his mother in law but in her <VOCNOISE> so she can <VOCNOISE> <SIL> right <SIL> uh <SIL> he's he has become more responsible <SIL> but responsible about a lot of things <VOCNOISE> which is again <SIL> <CUTOFF-n=normal> <SIL> at normal maturation <VOCNOISE> and he's just doing it the hard way <IVER>
he was <SIL> yknow pretty much promised a free ride through o s u's music program <VOCNOISE> and he turned that <VOCNOISE> and he's thrown that away <SIL> and i <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i don't even know if he regrets that <SIL> i really have no idea <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he just doesn't want talk to us about things like that <VOCNOISE> he does talk to <VOCNOISE> his girlfriend about it and she's become very close with my wife <VOCNOISE> she's <SIL> never had an adult <SIL> really the <VOCNOISE> um a mentor of any kind even <VOCNOISE> my <CUTOFF-wi=wife> she wants to go to <SIL> school my wife's <VOCNOISE> agreed to go with her when she goes for the interviews and stuff <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=she> <SIL> she says she doesn't know what to ask or anything and <IVER>
course my wife's worked in higher education for thirty years so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and she wants go to columbus state <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh wants to get into <VOCNOISE> one of their engineering tech programs <SIL> um <SIL> um hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i i hope she does <SIL> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-ca=because> she <CUTOFF-be=because> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she never fit in in high school she is very bright <SIL> she's <VOCNOISE> mature in <CUTOFF-so=some> many ways but she's had to be responsible for herself her whole life <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but she was never interested in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and never really interested in boys or in sports in high school <SIL> or uh <SIL> make up <SIL> and clothes and things like that and <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-yo=you're> <VOCNOISE> you're setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that <VOCNOISE> and that's what happened she'd come home in tears because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally <SIL> she just stopped going <SIL> and within a couple months <SIL> she got her g e d <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> may be kind of hard in a <SIL> when she gets into a <SIL> engineering tech program because she hasn't had all a the <SIL> math prerequisites <SIL> because she just didn't stay in school long enough <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i <IVER>
i think she yeah she will <IVER>
and <CUTOFF-she=she's> and she's very determined <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she has said that <SIL> <CUTOFF-ha=had> <VOCNOISE> having this being pregnant having this baby has made her focus on things a lot differently <VOCNOISE> she <CUTOFF-doe=doesn't> she doesn't wanna go back to being the way she was before she doesn't want go back to the <VOCNOISE> the drugs and the smoking and the drinking <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-hu=well> <CUTOFF-everyth=everything> uh <CUTOFF-th=the> all focus changes it really does <IVER>
and it never goes back to the way it was before did you just know that there's someone that's completely dependent on you for <SIL> everything <IVER>
everything you do <SIL> right <IVER>
right <IVER>
and she's taken very good care of herself she followed all the doctor's <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> orders and <SIL> she's very careful what she eats and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and they've met the couple that's gonna adopt the baby <SIL> which <SIL> seems kind of odd to me but <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh right and <CUTOFF-th=they> they were actually able to select the couple from a they talked to <HES-a> a lawyer who arranges adoptions <SIL> and she had a file and they <VOCNOISE> yknow threw kind of a bunch of questions and answers type thing were to limit to <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=three> down to three couples and they liked the first couple <SIL> they met <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
but uh you know with people <SIL> coming back later and saying that <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> they <ERROR-di=did> changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents i'd be concerned about that but <VOCNOISE> that's not gonna happen in this case i don't <SIL> think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the <SIL> because of her age and this makes no sense to me <VOCNOISE> the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for seventy two hours <SIL> before she can give it up for adoption <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> because of her age and it <SIL> doesn't make any sense to me but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so the yknow they're <SIL> talking to a social worker now to find out they don't want take the baby home <SIL> because they're afraid of being too attached to it then <VOCNOISE> and they don't think it's a good <HES-atmosphere> for it <SIL> because her mother smokes constantly her mother's alcoholic <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> they <IVER>
<NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <IVER>
<SIL> uh so she does not want <SIL> to take the baby home so they're <SIL> arranging some other things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we have actually talked about taking the baby home ourselves for that time but we think that's gonna be too hard for us <IVER>
we even talked about adopting the baby <VOCNOISE> but at our age <IVER>
that's <SIL> i mean we'd be seventy years old when the kid graduates from high school <VOCNOISE> uh and that wouldn't be fair to the kid <SIL> <CUTOFF-an=and> and we were doing it for the wrong reasons too so <SIL> we talked about it decided it wasn't a good idea <IVER>
i'm not sure i'm ready to go back through <LAUGH-all_that> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> as much fun as it was the first time <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> i just not <IVER>
ready willing to do that again <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it's a great experience it really <CUTOFF-i=it> <CUTOFF-wa=was> <CUTOFF-i=it> <CUTOFF-wa=was> <SIL> even when <SIL> yknow we were having problems with him and stuff it was great <SIL> uh he couldn't understand <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> my wife's once said told him she says yknow <VOCNOISE> something about spending time together <SIL> she <SIL> she said that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there is no time that we spend with you that's wasted <VOCNOISE> and he couldn't understand that <VOCNOISE> she said you mean this is fun i said i didn't say it was fun <LAUGH> <LAUGH-ju=just> <IVER>
it's just not <LAUGH-wasted> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't <SIL> think he really understood that he might someday but <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and i really think both of them will be good parents someday <VOCNOISE> but she says <SIL> we're not ready <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> she's <CUTOFF-be=been> <IVER>
she's been very mature about it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and she has <SIL> they are working on an arrangement with the <IVER>
uh <SIL> couple that are adopting baby will get <SIL> counseling for her <IVER>
afterwards too and that's one things they've asked for in the <SIL> adoption agreement <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and the <VOCNOISE> couple's <SIL> willing to do that <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <SIL> and yknow <CUTOFF-th=the> <VOCNOISE> while the baby's in the hospital be covered under my son's insurance and she's covered under her father's insurance so <VOCNOISE> their medical expenses are not gonna be very big <IVER>
so <IVER>

mm-hmm <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you get into a <VOCNOISE> situation where you really where there's a no win situation from the get go and uh <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i think that <VOCNOISE> had we been able to <SIL> do what we went over there to do initially <VOCNOISE> it would've worked out okay but we weren't so <SIL> so it became a political war as everybody knows that knows anything about it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah there was a lot of positive things <SIL> uh from it as far as discipline as far as uh <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> growing up <SIL> faster and everything yknow sometimes when i see a girl like my daughter or like other <SIL> other <VOCNOISE> people at that age yknow and everything i <VOCNOISE> yknow they tend to act grown up yknow or <SIL> i felt like i was <SIL> forced to grow up yknow <IVER>
a little bit faster <VOCNOISE> uh but <VOCNOISE> and then in <SIL> then when i get out of service like at twenty two yknow i was kind of like behind everybody yknow as far as my age group and stuff <SIL> that didn't have to go <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i had <CUTOFF-h=had> <SIL> had a lot of uh <SIL> good times as far as that goes and <VOCNOISE> yknow cleanliness and next to godliness and all that stuff yknow i mean a lot of people don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's just a lot of lax <SIL> stuff goes on today <SIL> in my opinion but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i i think that <VOCNOISE> my opinion is that if you ain't going to school and you're not going you're not working and everything you should uh <VOCNOISE> be doing something besides <SIL> causing problems yknow <SIL> and a lot of kids that's all they really wanna do nowadays is just <VOCNOISE> cause aggravation to people <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> the lack of discipline at the home <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well i've been <CUTOFF-th=the> see i wasn't much i <CUTOFF-w=was> <SIL> my <VOCNOISE> being here and my daughter being there i didn't really have the uh <SIL> time with her that i wished i would've had yknow but uh <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> her mother would yknow wouldn't did her all right and everything but <VOCNOISE> i wished that i would've been more involved in her <VOCNOISE> growing up <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i think two people families are generally better <SIL> yknow for <VOCNOISE> not necessarily living being <CUTOFF-lo=loved> yknow its about being married and everything but <IVER>
at least being able to be a part of their <SIL> your kid's <VOCNOISE-life> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i believe it's quality not quantity <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> ideally <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow um one parent would be there be it <SIL> male or female well yknow man or <CUTOFF-wi=wife> <VOCNOISE> man or <CUTOFF-wo=woman> or lady <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but yknow your quality time's more important <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> maybe go come home and you <VOCNOISE> and all you wanna do is sit down and start watching tv or drinking beer or whatever yknow and not spend any time with your child it doesn't matter <VOCNOISE-wheth=whether> you're <VOCNOISE> there all day or whether you're there for two hours <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> well i believe that's way it was originally set up you know so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
i personally don't believe that they should be allowed to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because i believe they they should have the male gender as well as the female gender <VOCNOISE> for a proper bringing up <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
balance <VOCNOISE-parent> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hum-um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i don't see any reason for it myself but uh <SIL> that's <VOCNOISE> interesting uh um <VOCNOISE> yknow when they when the first when the uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> when time began yknow according <SIL> my <CUTOFF-f=philosophy> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what i believe in and everything yknow it was <VOCNOISE> man and woman got married yknow and <VOCNOISE> and reason they got married was because of procreation yknow keep the <VOCNOISE> keep the uh population going <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i think that's the way it was set up originally so <VOCNOISE> i have no problem with a man being with a man or woman being with a woman but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> if <VOCNOISE> if that was the relationship <VOCNOISE> for everybody <IVER>
<LAUGH-then> uh <VOCNOISE> then obviously the <SIL> the civilization gonna be dead yknow so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
mm-hmm <SIL> well i've i've had gay friends and uh <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> one of them worked at a t and t and he retired <SIL> and then uh <SIL> and the other one was on a disability and everything so uh <VOCNOISE> that never even came up in their relationship <VOCNOISE> nor did it come up in uh a <CUTOFF-d=different> <SIL> another couple friends that i've had yknow that they uh <VOCNOISE> they more or less <SIL> took care of each other yknow <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i don't agree with it we had gays in there when i was in there yknow so <IVER>
yeah i mean you generally <SIL> could <VOCNOISE> i mean they didn't broadcast it obviously but <IVER>
<SIL> yknow they uh <SIL> i mean my personally would i would personally wouldn't care yknow as long as uh if i was in a foxhole with somebody i could care less whether he is gay or not <LAUGH> as long as he's shoot a gun yknow to help me out if i was in trouble so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
i think it's good and uh <SIL> i've yknow i think women are are capable of doing that my only <SIL> disagreement with it is that i'd have a real problem <SIL> being in that foxhole and have a woman beside me and <SIL> uh <SIL> she'd get shot yknow i don't know how i could deal with that it'd be <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> men i don't know if you you <SIL> you <SIL> women have <VOCNOISE> yknow different feelings but with about each other than they do with men and men have different feelings about each other <VOCNOISE> uh than they do with women and everything and they tend to be more protective <IVER>
<SIL> so <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> where a man yknow you kind of feel like he can carry his own weight yknow a woman you may not <SIL> you may <SIL> feel like you have to <SIL> do <SIL> a special thing in order to uh <SIL> uh to keep her from getting killed yknow or something or <CUTOFF-k=killed> just shot or something <VOCNOISE> so i wouldn't <SIL> personally i don't like that myself <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but i ain't had no problem with them being like a pilot or something like that yknow <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i wouldn't like it to be that way but uh basically when i was in the service the <CUTOFF-ta=unknown> the women uh <SIL> had their own <SIL> area of the service that they <VOCNOISE> were allowed to be basically nurses and stuff yknow <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> 
<NOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> they had they you know they went through their own training and everything we didn't <VOCNOISE> interface with each other or nothing like that you know i mean you might see one <SIL> walking <VOCNOISE> or marching somewhere but <SIL> as far as fraternizing you weren't allowed to <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um <IVER>
no not really i mean different cultures and everything uh <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i i went to school with blacks so i mean that wasn't that big a thing except for the <SIL> influx <VOCNOISE> of the you know <SIL> i didn't realize how many <SIL> were being drafted or being enlisting into the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the <SIL> in the country you know <IVER>
but it didn't bother me <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> religion's basically everybody when i was in there back in the sixties the i mean everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity either catholic or something like that but uh <SIL> nowadays you know you have the uh <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> more outspoken <ERROR=isla=islam> <CUTOFF-mus=muslims> muslims and <ERROR> uh <VOCNOISE> islam and uh <CUTOFF-Judia=Judiasm> and judaism and everything so <VOCNOISE> and there again i don't have a problem with that you know because you <SIL> you got to <SIL> meet yourself <VOCNOISE> you know you got to make your peace with your maker because you know <VOCNOISE> if you believe in religion you're <VOCNOISE> you're here temporarily for an eternity later on you know <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
well i <HES-?> one thing uh you know being uh <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i came from basically a poor <CUTOFF-neigh=neighborhood> <ERROR-poo=poor> poor uh <VOCNOISE> uh lifestyle uh early life and everything you know so uh <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> if anything i guess it kind of made me negative uh <SIL> towards people that <SIL> had an influence had money <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> didn't do any <SIL> thing good with it you know <VOCNOISE> i'm a firm believer that if you got something that you should share it with other other people <VOCNOISE> i don't always <SIL> practice what i preach but <SIL> you know that's <SIL> i'd be a good philosophy to live by <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and people of other religions and everything um <VOCNOISE> you know i learned a lot about religion when i <CUTOFF-w=was> i was raised baptist basically but uh <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> practice more catholic than anything else now uh <SIL> but i'm <SIL> generally pretty knowledgeable about judaism and muslims and <VOCNOISE> everything just because i find it <SIL> interesting <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> you know was in sixty nines when i went in so <VOCNOISE> you know you can <VOCNOISE> kind of figure that it was <NOISE> the <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was kind of uh <LAUGH> it was different when i because see because when i went in <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and you know well i never had any problem with a black person or or i didn't really care you know as long as they uh <VOCNOISE> did their job and everything i'm basically the same way today <VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
but people coming from other <VOCNOISE> cities <VOCNOISE> like chicago new york yknow and places like that where they were <VOCNOISE> treated poorly by whites you know they <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> they tended to <SIL> act differently towards you and everything <VOCNOISE> until they realized that you weren't like that you know <SIL> uh we only had one racial incident when i was in the service uh <VOCNOISE> where it was <SIL> we were predominantly white <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> platoon <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so uh <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> then <SIL> the security cops were <ERROR-pa=predominantly> <SIL> above us and they were predominantly black you know <VOCNOISE> and i don't know what happened something <SIL> happened one time there was only like twenty people in our <VOCNOISE> whole uh <VOCNOISE> platoon it was all in the same barracks <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> some guy said something <VOCNOISE> off color to one of them or something like that you know and <VOCNOISE> got kind of out of hand for a while but <VOCNOISE> you know thank god nothing <CUTOFF-r=really> really happened <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
i think that the <IVER>
i think society is today of today is less tolerant of uh <SIL> a lot of things that they see where getting by with stuff you know <VOCNOISE> and they're more vocal about it as opposed to being violent about it back in <VOCNOISE> the sixties and stuff you know uh <SIL> not here <SIL> but you know down south there were people still getting <SIL> hung and stuff you know for being <SIL> a black or something and uh <VOCNOISE> know there are bad blacks and there's bad whites too you know <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> but not all of them are <VOCNOISE> you know <SIL> are that way <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
but that's what i mean it's more you know it's they're they're more vocal about it more uh uh more 
t v about and everything that stuff's been going on for years so <SIL> <IVER>
um hum <SIL> <IVER>
well i think it's more <SIL> capable of being violent because of the uh <SIL> information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> before you know if somebody got mad at somebody you know you <VOCNOISE> might <SIL> they might shoot them or something but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not <EXT-kill> a hundred innocent people for no reason <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i i personally don't because uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i've seen maybe not to the degree of the violence but mean i still knew it was violent uh <SIL> stuff when i was kid you know that didn't make me a violent person <SIL> so <IVER>
<SIL> i think that's a cop out myself <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i wish i knew the answer uh <SIL> but <SIL> the reality you know uh <SIL> i just feel sorry for the the people <CUTOFF-w=?> that not only feel that they have to do that <SIL> but <ERROR> and also for the people that <SIL> are involved in it on the other those victims and everything and their parents and everything <VOCNOISE> the only one i really had a <VOCNOISE> i was really upset with uh was the columbine deal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that was because uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the one kid <SIL> was making bombs and stuff like that in the basement and the parents <HES-knew> nothing about or or they did they didn't even think anything about and i don't think that behavior <SIL> it's uh appropriate for a <SIL> sixteen seventeen year old kid <SIL> um <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and but you know that there and goes back to uh <VOCNOISE> you know the quality or the quantity i mean if <SIL> obviously this <SIL> poor kid you know apparently <VOCNOISE> was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs in basement to <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to <SIL> figure out some way of uh <SIL> reaching his <VOCNOISE> <SIL> nirvana or whatever you know and uh <SIL> then his parents didn't have a clue <SIL> or if they did they didn't care you know <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
hum um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
hum um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-mah=?> <CUTOFF-y=yknow?> well <VOCNOISE> nowadays <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> i grew up my dad hunted and everything you know so we had always had uh <SIL> guns in the house and everything you know but uh <SIL> you know i wouldn't <SIL> no more <UNKNOWN> go <SIL> near one unless he was around because i uh <VOCNOISE> i was told not to you know <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> they they always used to say you know if you if you stop letting <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh normal people get a gun and the criminals will always have a gun well obviously that's not true you know <SIL> uh <SIL> my personal belief is that we have the right to bear arms <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> if you're of a legal age and everything i'm not really sure the background checks <SIL> really do that great of a job <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> how they going to how are they going to judge <SIL> how they going to <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> make sure the lock is on a gun i mean <SIL> that just seems like a waste of money to me <SIL> all you're doing is <CUTOFF-get=getting> letting a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a company <VOCNOISE> sell a a trigger lock <SIL> for a gun <SIL> or and make it make the guy make somebody have to buy one <VOCNOISE> but you're not going make you put it on the gun so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> just seems like a waste of <SIL> legislation <VOCNOISE> money <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well <HES-the> <HES-the> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> definitely this happened to me when i was in the <SIL> third grade uh a friend of uh two of our friends were uh <SIL> uh <SIL> went home after school we were playing with a gun and everything and one uh one of them shot and killed the other one yknow accidentally <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> it just goes to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow my dad always had a gun he <HES-didn't> didn't have it locked up all the time but yknow wasn't necessarily in the same place all the time either yknow i mean so <VOCNOISE> if you weren't really looking for it <SIL> and you know ah you <CUTOFF-hap=happen> to <CUTOFF-happenstan=happenstance> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> happenstance on to it or something you know uh <SIL> uh <SIL> i believe nowadays you know that <VOCNOISE> perhaps with the uh with the <SIL> the guns <UNKNOWN> you know the availability being more people having guns that don't know don't <SIL> shouldn't have them <SIL> apparently <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> you know they should be uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-loc=lock> under lock and key <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and as for the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know the parents <VOCNOISE> somebody's responsible for you know <SIL> but see then you get in to catch twenty two because of the legislation i mean you can't require <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't see how you can require a <LAUGH> <SIL> uh <SIL> a guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe for the <SIL> for the gun and and and do all that stuff because that <VOCNOISE> in the case of a burglar comes into your house <SIL> which is why <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> why you have a <VOCNOISE> gun anyway you have some fear of something like that happening otherwise you shouldn't have one unless you're a sportsman <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> then you know you're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not gonna be worth it to have the gun in the first place so <IVER>
uh <SIL> i do believe that in some the cases <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> the parents or the uh <SIL> responsible adult <SIL> should be uh <SIL> found guilty of that <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
um <LAUGH-hum> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <EXT-I> well <NOISE> that's a <VOCNOISE> that's a tough one uh <SIL> i remember when you know when we were we had you know <SIL> some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know or <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was <VOCNOISE> you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but <VOCNOISE> and to me that's fake <SIL> and uh uh <NOISE> and i never really thought about when was growing up that it was <VOCNOISE> what was real and everything uh i always knew that <VOCNOISE> by i there again know by my dad being a hunter and everything you know i knew that when you shot something that it died it wasn't a it wasn't a game you know <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> i'd hate to think that that would <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> cause some kid to go off his rocker and shoot somebody out <ERROR-shi=shoot> shoot another human being i mean that doesn't <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> i don't even know why there should be any concern for it guess is what i'm saying <IVER>
<SIL> no <CUTOFF-we=we> <VOCNOISE> we uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i generally tried to keep her childhood her childhood yknow <SIL> there's a time to grow up and there's time to be a child and and uh <VOCNOISE> we divorced when she was eight years old so <VOCNOISE> i would get up every saturday morning and watch cartoons with her and stuff like that yknow <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> tried not to let her watch some of the ones that i <SIL> that i didn't like yknow so <SIL> and then on movies and stuff uh <SIL> we'd let her see some <SIL> shoot them up movies and everything but <VOCNOISE> the the weirdest movie she's seen uh <VOCNOISE> was e t <SIL> i remember that i mean <SIL> 
<VOCNOISE> her and her mother went and seen it and everything we were <VOCNOISE> divorced at the time and uh <VOCNOISE> then i went and bought the movie <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
and brought her over to my house on the weekend and everything and <VOCNOISE> showed her the movie and <VOCNOISE> i said this is e t we're going to watch <VOCNOISE> e t she goes all right you know we was eating pizza you know and <VOCNOISE> and put it on and then when he <EXT-dies> <VOCNOISE> she starts bawling and everything and i'm going <VOCNOISE> well what's the matter and she goes <VOCNOISE> well he's going to die i said no he ain't you've seen the movie <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but you know it wasn't <SIL> to her <VOCNOISE> the way i <VOCNOISE> took it was that you know <SIL> it wasn't the same it <SIL> it was just wasn't the same movie so <IVER>
and in this one he could die so <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <LAUGH> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
no there's a lot of people go to church that aren't worth anything too you know so i don't really believe that <CUTOFF-per=person> <VOCNOISE> going to church you know uh <VOCNOISE> uh <CUTOFF-r=?> <SIL> makes you a better human being than another human being <VOCNOISE> i believe that the you know your <VOCNOISE> i believe that most people with basic <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> structure in their life if it's <VOCNOISE> based similar to the bible <VOCNOISE> or you could say buddhism or whatever you know uh <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> that you'll tend to have a better <VOCNOISE-life> than you will if you <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-practice> <VOCNOISE> non <VOCNOISE> quote unquote religious <CUTOFF-w=ways> <VOCNOISE> religious ways <VOCNOISE> but i don't believe somebody going to church makes them a better human being than the next person <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-because_there's> a lot of <VOCNOISE> hypocrites that go to church <VOCNOISE> now these kids i <VOCNOISE> i think more just more than anything else i mean <VOCNOISE> one thing i <CUTOFF-r=remember> <VOCNOISE> i remember hearing it a lot about too was they <CUTOFF-we=were> they were picked on <IVER>
i mean <LAUGH> come <LAUGH-on> <VOCNOISE> who wasn't picked on you know <IVER>
i mean just because you're i mean i wasn't really a <VOCNOISE> an athletic i did <CUTOFF-s=sports> play uh <SIL> sports when i was in in high school but i <CUTOFF-wa=was> <VOCNOISE> damn sure wasn't any good you know <UNKNOWN> like <VOCNOISE> other guys but <VOCNOISE> whether i did or whether i didn't you know i <VOCNOISE> i don't <VOCNOISE> i don't <VOCNOISE> nobody picked on me <UNKNOWN> i mean one time i got into it <ERROR-wha=with> <VOCNOISE> with one of the uh <VOCNOISE> centers in football you know big old guy <VOCNOISE> and then uh <VOCNOISE> and i <VOCNOISE-was> still about the same size but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh he said he's going to <VOCNOISE> kick my you know what and everything i said well be outside you know <IVER>
no he <VOCNOISE> he didn't even come <ERROR-ba=bye> i mean he came out but <VOCNOISE> it's like he went the other way i thought well you know he <VOCNOISE> you take it if he'd <VOCNOISE> get a big kick out of kicking my skinny little butt you know then <IVER>
but you know <VOCNOISE> and years ago it was kind of funny we'd seen him uh seen each other and everything and uh <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> at the <VOCNOISE> someplace around and he sit there and went <VOCNOISE> hey remember that time i said yeah yeah yeah <IVER>
he says i didn't <IVER>
he said i didn't think you'd stand up to me i said well you know what the heck <VOCNOISE> you know <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> only thing you could do is <VOCNOISE> beat my rear end you know so <IVER>
i think there's a heck of a lot more to it then what we'll probably ever know um <VOCNOISE> you know <CUTOFF-tho=those> they really haven't checked into the background of the parents you know they're still <CUTOFF-b=?> <VOCNOISE> what their beliefs were and everything <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and i think that's a shame because you know you mentioned it <VOCNOISE-before> about <VOCNOISE> something accidentally <ERROR-happingening=happening> <VOCNOISE> where uh <VOCNOISE> some kid shoots another kid you know and then the parents are <VOCNOISE> are responsible <VOCNOISE-for> it and everything you know these two kids <VOCNOISE-deliberately> went in <VOCNOISE> to kill <VOCNOISE> and they wanted to kill more than what they killed <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> then they killed <EXT-themselves> so we'll never know <VOCNOISE-from> their endpoint why they did it <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i think there's got to be something <VOCNOISE> that we could <VOCNOISE-find> out <VOCNOISE-from> you know uh <VOCNOISE> from their parents as to how they lived you know they could have been <VOCNOISE> anything you know <VOCNOISE> they could have been down there they could have been <VOCNOISE> making him making him do it you know <IVER>
uh uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i just think it's a different time now i don't think i think everybody's <VOCNOISE> living more <VOCNOISE-for> today <VOCNOISE> and talking about the future you know <VOCNOISE> hoping that the future's <EXT-there> <VOCNOISE> i think there's a <VOCNOISE> quote unquote uh <SIL> in time aspect to life you know <IVER>
everybody's living longer everybody's uh there's more medical things where people get uh <VOCNOISE> can <CUTOFF-g=get> be healed <VOCNOISE-from> things that they couldn't be healed <VOCNOISE-from> uh <VOCNOISE> so everybody today is living <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> basically as today as their <VOCNOISE-future> where back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean <VOCNOISE> i wasn't really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about <VOCNOISE> tomorrow <IVER>
<NOISE> getting married having kids you know and having a <VOCNOISE> nice place to live <IVER>
<NOISE> um hum <IVER>
yeah and then you know then <SIL> i'll show that son of a gun you know i'll <VOCNOISE> i'll shoot him you know <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> like you know the guys that were <VOCNOISE-supposedly> picking on him i don't even know whether they even shot him then but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but yeah i think they kind of just thought you know <CUTOFF-I=I'll> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'll <VOCNOISE> you know i'll <VOCNOISE> i'll <VOCNOISE-prove> to them that <NOISE> you know they can't push me around <IVER>
and <ERROR-unfortunanley=unfortunately> uh they didn't really <VOCNOISE-prove> anything except for that they that <VOCNOISE> death is <VOCNOISE-final> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
she graduated last year <VOCNOISE> so uh <NOISE> but <VOCNOISE> she went to <VOCNOISE> she went <CUTOFF-ho=home> she was on home study <NOISE> so <NOISE> <CUTOFF-sh=she> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE-hum_um> she had a uh <SIL> she <VOCNOISE-was> taught a <CUTOFF-tu=tutor> by a tutor <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> from <VOCNOISE> she <VOCNOISE-was> from kirkisville that's <VOCNOISE-before> she graduated <SIL> which is a suburb of saint louis <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um generally it's in the summertime uh <VOCNOISE> that's the way it was when she was going to school <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> now you know with her going to school at like at like at uh saint louis <VOCNOISE> um <NOISE> i guess it would be that way <IVER>
but we really ever <CUTOFF-ha=havn't> <VOCNOISE> really haven't talked about that but my ex wife's got family here <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> you know she comes in about two or three <VOCNOISE> weeks at least out of a summer <IVER>
and i tend to see her then <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> i uh <VOCNOISE> i think she really kind of knows that from conversations uh with me and <VOCNOISE-stuff> while she was growing <NOISE-up> <NOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> you know mine uh my values and stuff <VOCNOISE> basically are uh more religious oriented <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> than i would say <SIL> my wife's <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> so i think she kinda she knows <VOCNOISE> what i value as being important what i value as <VOCNOISE> being not important and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but <NOISE> on it the rest of the question <CUTOFF-ih=?> i'd <VOCNOISE> i'd love to have been able to have uh <VOCNOISE> uh been <CUTOFF-ykno=yknow?> <VOCNOISE> every other weekend sounds good you know as far as a <IVER>
um <IVER>

<VOCNOISE-see_I_was_the_second_generation_of_his> because he's like <VOCNOISE> he was like <VOCNOISE-fifty> some <VOCNOISE-years> old when i <VOCNOISE-was> born so <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-probably> the <VOCNOISE-last> thing <VOCNOISE-he_really> wanted <VOCNOISE-was> another kid <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yknow> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-some> of them are all the above <LAUGH> <SIL> um hum <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> some of them aren't <VOCNOISE-there's_a> quite a few of them that <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-have_adjusted_well_to_society> uh <VOCNOISE> when they came home <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-biggest_thing> i think when uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-what_what_happened_is> that <VOCNOISE> there <VOCNOISE-wasn't> any <EXT-joy> <VOCNOISE-about> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-us> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-like_world_war> <EXT-two> <EXT-and> <VOCNOISE-Korea> and <CUTOFF-ever=every> yknow <VOCNOISE-it's> like you came <VOCNOISE-off> got <VOCNOISE-off> the plane and <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE-nobody_really_cared> yknow <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> well i i got one <VOCNOISE-buddy_that's> that that <VOCNOISE-is> <VOCNOISE> meets all the criteria <VOCNOISE-there> and <VOCNOISE-everything> and uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-might_seem_quite_a_bit> on the <VOCNOISE-street_and_everything> yknow and uh <VOCNOISE> and he <VOCNOISE-just> <VOCNOISE> he <VOCNOISE-begs> me to take him and get him <VOCNOISE-help> and everything but yknow i keep saying <EXCLUDE-name> yknow you're the one who's got to <VOCNOISE-help_yourself> man <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> you got to <VOCNOISE-give_it> up the <VOCNOISE-war's_over> yknow <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> and he's like <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-fifty_three> <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-I_see> him down here every now and then <VOCNOISE-yknow_so> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-but> <VOCNOISE> yknow he <VOCNOISE-just> drinks all the time to try to <SIL> ease the <VOCNOISE-pain> and the <VOCNOISE-pain> really should have been <VOCNOISE> done gone by <VOCNOISE-as_much> as he <VOCNOISE-drank> in his <VOCNOISE-life> yknow <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i think there's a lot of <NOISE-people_that> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> can <VOCNOISE-use_that_as> an excuse yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<IVER>
um hum <IVER>
i don't really work with them all i basically do is i know a lot of people and everything and they <CUTOFF-c=come> tend to come in there for help and you know and i just kinda help out with the uh <IVER>
some of the work that <NOISE-needs> be done <IVER>
talk to them or whatever you know <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i tell <NOISE-people> they can go there <VOCNOISE> it's the v v a vietnam veteran's association some people don't even know about it you know <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> a lot of them they don't want any better they won't want anything different that's all they want <IVER>
i think that basically that's in a nut shell they've reached a point in their life where <VOCNOISE> you know that they're cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death or <SIL> um <SIL> smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh <CUTOFF-p=?> crack or whatever and uh <VOCNOISE> then just living <SIL> in a hell i mean <IVER>
basically because you know <SIL> the open shelter i don't know whether you ever been around there but it <SIL> it isn't a pretty sight you know <IVER>
i'd say of uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think they the the v v a in generally sees on the average <SIL> five seven ten something like that a day <VOCNOISE> and not all of them homeless <IVER>
and not all of them are <SIL> are vietnam vets either you know <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> but you know they tend to say i'd say of those there's about three <VOCNOISE> three to four of them that are vietnam veterans <VOCNOISE> uh a day <SIL> and they tend to <SIL> come back i mean i <CUTOFF-s=started> <VOCNOISE> originally started going in there just drinking coffee you know to kill time and everything you know <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now i kinda know everybody you know and <VOCNOISE> somebody'll walk in and i'll say hey how's it going you know <VOCNOISE> and they'll talk <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-th=then> then there's <SIL> i there's another thing to <CUTOFF-a=about> <CUTOFF-a=about> <SIL> about <VOCNOISE> a lot of the uh <SIL> people back uh vietnam <CUTOFF-ever=everything> and everything that the <SIL> they'll tend to talk to maybe you or talk to somebody else <SIL> and uh a like an authoritative figure and not believe a damn word they say <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <SIL> um hum <SIL> well they go to the clinic sometimes and uh <VOCNOISE> clinic's basically a pill popping place you know here <SIL> take these you'll feel better you know <VOCNOISE> then they they really don't get any <VOCNOISE> <SIL> satisfaction for what ails them you know that side of a <VOCNOISE> you know you tell you you tell them you can't drink but yet you give them a pill that'll give them the same effect you know <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> whose <IVER>
um hum um hum <IVER>

um <IVER>
pick up bodies <VOCNOISE> um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
well i know people that'll sleep outside and uh <VOCNOISE> not all of them are veterans and everything but they there again they don't want to be a part of the quote unquote <SIL> sheltered <SIL> system you know <SIL> uh <SIL> staying at an open shelter v o a or something like that <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> i think it's just <VOCNOISE> if they're vietnam vets i think it's <SIL> the authority thing you know well you lied to me once you lied to me <VOCNOISE> four hundred times since then you know you <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> probably going to lie to me again you know and uh <VOCNOISE> then a lot of them i don't think are capable <VOCNOISE> while in their present condition i know like <EXCLUDE-name> the friend of mine i'm talking about <VOCNOISE> there's no way in hell that he could hold down a job <IVER>
right now <VOCNOISE> but i knew him when he was eight ten months <SIL> sober <SIL> and he worked every day <IVER>
but just something happened why he got <SIL> him and his girlfriend broke up <IVER>
and that was like <VOCNOISE> around christmas time <VOCNOISE> and i ran into him like february or something like that <VOCNOISE> and ever since february its <SIL> he's been <SIL> sitting on a bench getting drunk everyday <IVER>
and i sit there and go you know <VOCNOISE> i tell people <UNKNOWN> the <VOCNOISE> v a clinic and everything and they got a homeless <SIL> thing uh over there i say you know <SIL> this guy friend i know you know he's a vietnam vet <VOCNOISE> you guys need to get out there and help him you know <VOCNOISE> i mean you're in more of a uh <VOCNOISE> situation than i am to be able to go out and and and sit there and <VOCNOISE> but he wants me to take him like mary haven or something like that <VOCNOISE> and he's been there before and all he does is stay till he sobers up and goes back out <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i'm not gonna get too much of an attitude from people <IVER>
okay <SIL> i'm thinking <VOCNOISE-people> who who back <VOCNOISE-pack> are pretty cool <SIL> yknow <IVER>
is that right <SIL> <LAUGH> especially if they're <CUTOFF-A=Americans> <SIL> americans <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> you have <CUTOFF-ah=?> <VOCNOISE> yknow like yknow <CUTOFF-th=the> the <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=the> <CUTOFF-th=the> <CUTOFF-th=the> uh <VOCNOISE> typical american <VOCNOISE> tourist <IVER>
really they they are the biggest assholes <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> the <CUTOFF-ma=majority> <VOCNOISE> they are <CUTOFF-th=the> they are <CUTOFF-th=the> the <CUTOFF-m=majority> <SIL> they are the the majority huh <IVER>

um no actually now i live in hilliard <IVER>
and i have a wife <VOCNOISE> been married thirteen years have two kids age five and seven <VOCNOISE> both of them ones in second grade and the other ones <SIL> still in daycare at ohio state university <IVER>
um-hum mobile <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> it is it's a lot of work it really is <VOCNOISE> she's a a nurse and she works at the <EXCLUDE-name> medical center <VOCNOISE> in the breast cancer department <SIL> she's a <SIL> o r nurse <SIL> she's worked here for twenty two years also got her degree at ohio state <SIL> she grew up in dayton and then moved here to go to college and <VOCNOISE> then stayed uh at ohio state after college <IVER>
we met at ohio state <VOCNOISE> um yeah everything revolves around ohio state huh <VOCNOISE> i worked when i first started working here i was working as an <VOCNOISE> orderly in the operating room for ten years and she worked in the intensive care unit so <VOCNOISE> only been in the maintenance area for maybe ten <VOCNOISE> years also <VOCNOISE> um i don't know it just <VOCNOISE> i don't know it didn't seem like it was heading anywhere and i wanted to start doing something that was more career oriented now i do <VOCNOISE> h a h v a c for <VOCNOISE> twenty two buildings in the northeast area <VOCNOISE> do a lot of <VOCNOISE> chillers and <VOCNOISE> laser labs and chill water for uh <SIL> different kinds of experiments they're doing in the chemistry departments and stuff like that so <SIL> went to school <VOCNOISE> through our <SIL> technical school <VOCNOISE> for it to get a degree in the <VOCNOISE> uh h v a c stuff <VOCNOISE> oh yeah i like it's everyday is different you have different problems everyday yknow and <VOCNOISE> i like <VOCNOISE> working with tools and fixing stuff so <VOCNOISE> that's uh come in handy but <IVER>
yeah from the <LAUGH-strike> yeah <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> um actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off so didn't make you feel as needed as you wanted to be maybe <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> yeah yknow <VOCNOISE> we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went <VOCNOISE> on strike and i think <VOCNOISE> the bosses <VOCNOISE> knew this was coming so <SIL> a lot of the air conditioning was already running by then <IVER>
right yeah the middle of may is when they usually start most of this stuff <VOCNOISE> heating cooling and ventilation <VOCNOISE> uh-hum <IVER>
um all of them the university is divided up in different areas <VOCNOISE> and there's a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas usually <VOCNOISE> there are about twenty buildings or so ours is <VOCNOISE> in the northeast area <VOCNOISE> from wexner down through the oval to <VOCNOISE> oh i don't know about <VOCNOISE> uh derby or so around in there and then on over to woodruff <IVER>
nope <VOCNOISE> not my <CUTOFF-ar=area> <VOCNOISE> not my area if it's hot in here <LAUGH> <IVER>
you better call the north shop <VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
because yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well that's probably the roof right there so <IVER>
there was snow or something <IVER>
i'll bet <VOCNOISE> yep <IVER>
hm <IVER>
control problems <VOCNOISE> of course there's always a leak somewhere <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> well it could be hot water they <VOCNOISE> send out heat and hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant <VOCNOISE> but about now they drain that <VOCNOISE> it's drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so <VOCNOISE> they might have drained it and that's why it quit <VOCNOISE> hm yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-then> run quick <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> put plastic up <VOCNOISE> oh i don't know it seemed like <VOCNOISE> it's a tough call because it's very unusual situation here at ohio state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions you think of autoworkers you think of pipefitters you think of you don't think of such a wide variety of people <VOCNOISE> and that's very hard to negotiate for anybody yknow when you're talking raises and lots of money like this which what they were going for <VOCNOISE> and the majority of the people in the skilled trades <VOCNOISE> aren't real big participaters in the union yknow we just ride along and from what i've seen over the twenty years i've been here <VOCNOISE> is it seemed that <VOCNOISE> a lot of the union <VOCNOISE> what they did was was keep <VOCNOISE> the trouble maker employees around longer yknow <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> so we've really never had a lot of use for the union but <VOCNOISE> recently we just figured out that you <LAUGH-know> <VOCNOISE> if they decide to strike we have no choice too and <VOCNOISE> you can't work because they will take all the money you make <VOCNOISE> crossing that lines so <VOCNOISE> you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they'll take them to court <VOCNOISE> and they'll <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> it's against <VOCNOISE> yeah it's against the union contracts so <VOCNOISE> you have just <IVER>
no no they take no they take the money whether you're in it or not you have no choice you have a choice as to whether you're a member or not but they still take the money <VOCNOISE> and if you cross the line they'll take that money back <VOCNOISE> so anybody that <VOCNOISE> yeah yknow you're better off getting another job if it lasts for a long time <VOCNOISE> i did some of that <LAUGH-interviewing> <VOCNOISE> it's tough to yknow columbus has a big <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> job market there's everywhere you look there's help wanted so but it's tough to get a job where you can just walk in and start today or yknow tell him hey yknow the minute strike is over i'm gone and <VOCNOISE> so that was kind of tough looking for that type of job so <VOCNOISE> oh yeah three weeks of pay it's cost yeah cost quite a bit of money but <VOCNOISE> if you got some <SIL> strike pay and this and that but it wasn't a lot yknow two hundred dollars a week isn't much at all so <VOCNOISE> and when you have a <LAUGH-family> and <VOCNOISE> i mean two hundred dollars a week don't pay my day care bill so <VOCNOISE> so it's gonna be tight for our family for <VOCNOISE> a few months yknow to get back on <IVER>
no <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> the money <VOCNOISE> yknow the money is great yknow fine it's the biggest raise they've ever given anybody here at the university <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went out on strike <VOCNOISE> was a better deal than what they've really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and <VOCNOISE> the big stipulation was the fact that these people didn't wanna be separated from the hospital <VOCNOISE> they don't think it's fair yknow that <VOCNOISE> you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and <VOCNOISE> then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so <VOCNOISE> that's kind of a sticky situation because they've always kept the university <VOCNOISE> and the hospital separate budget <VOCNOISE> they are definitely a separate budget and you know the u <VOCNOISE> hospital i can see where they're coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that <VOCNOISE> and they're <VOCNOISE> thirty five million in the hole because they bought o s u east and all this but <VOCNOISE> yknow it's not the unions fault that they <VOCNOISE> ran out the contract yknow and yknow so <VOCNOISE> and what we find in our area mainly is <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> people <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> entrance wage is so low that <VOCNOISE> it's hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that's yknow and they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever as far as but they're not willing to pay a lot of these people and <VOCNOISE> yknow they think contracting is the way but you're always gonna have to have people here to because <VOCNOISE> contractors just don't drop what they're doing and show up today <VOCNOISE> and a lot of times we have a job finished before they've written up the work order 
<VOCNOISE> yknow we're right there within moments if there's a flood or yknow something like that you call the <CUTOFF-contra=contract> i'll be in thursday yknow if your air condition so <VOCNOISE> they're always gonna have to have people here so i just feel <SIL> they're either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people <VOCNOISE> than have twenty people that half of them know what's going on half of them don't so but that's tough to do when you're starting <SIL> people at eight dollars an hour and stuff so <VOCNOISE> there's yknow wendy's <LAUGH-McDonald's> there's places that you can make that money so <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> my <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> to me the thing that hurt me the most out of it is <VOCNOISE> they wanna put caps <VOCNOISE> on our salaries <VOCNOISE> so i'm at the highest scale i can go <VOCNOISE> right now as far as job title <VOCNOISE> i there's no other job i can move to until unless i move in to <SIL> supervision or some up in the <VOCNOISE> and i'll be out of the union if i do that anyways so <VOCNOISE> but they're gonna put a cap on that <SIL> where you can only make so much money <SIL> at a point which i'm almost there right now i'm only like fifty cents away from that cap <VOCNOISE> and if that's the case <SIL> if i retire in six years <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'll be capped out right now so then in other words i'm wanna retire in six years if i don't change jobs <VOCNOISE> making exactly what i make now which that was my worst fear of it all but <VOCNOISE> that wasn't even on the <LAUGH-negotiating> table they were still worried about this two dollars and get this <CUTOFF-hosp=hospital> yeah <VOCNOISE> that's what they were fighting for was the low end and didn't <VOCNOISE> try to get the hospital and the uh <SIL> main campus the same <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um yeah there's <SIL> yknow our shop only has about five people out of twenty maybe that have been here over ten years probably <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lot of turnover <SIL> a lot of <VOCNOISE> people go on to management positions and <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> leave or <VOCNOISE> but once you've got <LAUGH-twenty_years> and it's like you <VOCNOISE> you can't leave now <VOCNOISE> yknow i'm like <IVER>
locked in now so <VOCNOISE> yknow i'll be forty eight when i retire from here and i'll be able to go out <SIL> in the workplace and <VOCNOISE> feel like i've gotten good education and work skills from working here for this long and <VOCNOISE> yknow they've definitely paid for classes for me so i don't know what they're big <VOCNOISE> gripe is for education when they're striking and all this because <VOCNOISE> i've never had a problem if you wanna take a class we get classes <SIL> we can take anything we want so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's available it's just whether they go and <SIL> put forth the effort so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
sure <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> you can take yeah i mean <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
people graduate get degrees from ohio state <VOCNOISE> working here <VOCNOISE> taking one course a <CUTOFF-qu=quarter> <SIL> one course a quarter <SIL> and get a degree in history or whatever it might take them <SIL> to <CUTOFF-f=unknown> ten years or something yknow but <VOCNOISE> it's like why not <SIL> it's free <IVER>
yeah why not take advantage of this <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> why not take advantage of that so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i don't know yknow <IVER>
i've <SIL> keep thinking about that all time but it <VOCNOISE> i'm like i want something where i can be off during the summer <VOCNOISE> so i can take my kids and we can go out west or yknow <SIL> have because my wife's in the same boat she'll retire two years after i do and our kids yknow will be young <VOCNOISE> i five year old and i only have six years to go so we're talking eleven years old <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> then they won't wanna go anywhere with you <LAUGH-anyways> so <VOCNOISE> it's <LAUGH-probably> a pipe <LAUGH-dream> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> now is when i need to be <LAUGH-off> with them yknow where we can <VOCNOISE> take them out and run <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
uh we've been very happy with the o s u daycare i don't know if you have any association with but oh it's <SIL> it's just unbelievable <VOCNOISE> our daughter went there her from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i mean when she got out of that daycare she could read she could write she could do computer yknow <SIL> yknow <SIL> it's an education it's not <VOCNOISE> yknow people you pay for it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> one of your highers but <VOCNOISE> yknow higher amount of money for <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that's what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good daycare because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so <VOCNOISE> that's how it first started before it you wasn't even on campus it was over on <VOCNOISE> like fourth or summit in a church when it first started <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> yknow <SIL> it's just not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow people are always saying i can't believe how much you pay for daycare <VOCNOISE> and i'm like but look what we're getting yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> people take their kids to <VOCNOISE> somebody's neighbor's house and <SIL> the lady can be sitting them in front of the tv and <IVER>
and nothing happens yknow <VOCNOISE> over here <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
over here you have students <SIL> that coming in and work as work studies and this and that and they're in <VOCNOISE> the education field or this they're gung ho they're ready to go a quarter changes and a whole group new pumped in yknow <VOCNOISE> and most of the teachers there are <VOCNOISE> mothers themselves and yknow they have computers in the room they've learning yknow <VOCNOISE> it's really yknow we've <SIL> sending both of them to kindergarten at o s u too <VOCNOISE> they offer a kindergarten program there mainly because it's all day <VOCNOISE> where in the hilliard school system and theirs is a half a day so we feel <VOCNOISE> we're better off leaving them there <IVER>
than <SIL> bussing them to a half a day kindergarten then bussing them to a daycare that's near their school so we might as well do all day plenty of time <VOCNOISE> they get a nap <VOCNOISE> they yknow they get fed and all that so <VOCNOISE> been really happy with the daycare there <SIL> <IVER>
mm-hmm <SIL> where from <IVER>
oh my <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> wow <IVER>
oh that's it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
there's not a lot around yknow <VOCNOISE> and we were on the list forever we were on the list five years before we had our <CUTOFF-f=first> <SIL> first kid <LAUGH-so> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> they called <VOCNOISE> well are you still wanna be on the list yeah we don't have any children but keep us on the <LAUGH-list> yknow <VOCNOISE> and it's like you said it's a and there's three or four hundred kids in that daycare it's a large daycare <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> there's <VOCNOISE> not a lot out there that's good quality yknow i mean you'll it's scary and then you see it in the news and <VOCNOISE> then <VOCNOISE-uh> they were <VOCNOISE> abusing the kids or you know and you don't wanna go to work feeling <SIL> that you're worrying about your kids and we've never really felt like that <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> we kind of work a little different shifts my wife and i so <VOCNOISE> our kids are only actually there about five hours a day because she doesn't start until nine thirty and i <SIL> pick them up at four so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets <VOCNOISE-them> the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then <VOCNOISE> then she can take the boy over to <SIL> the daycare and then they're only there five hours or so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
their daycare <VOCNOISE> oh i don't know it's tough i think <CUTOFF-f=for> <SIL> really i believe more in that <SIL> large corporations <VOCNOISE> need to <SIL> have some kind of daycare offered it's just there's not that many people anymore that can afford <VOCNOISE> to have a one income family i mean yknow we could do it yknow but <VOCNOISE> yknow we wouldn't live as nice as we do we wouldn't have as nice of cars as we do yknow we'd struggle a little more so <VOCNOISE> so it's a toss up it's a real <IVER>
yknow it's a real worried and you really have to think about it <SIL> when you start getting there because <VOCNOISE> it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you're going oh geezy are we doing the right thing yknow <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> yknow some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with we <SIL> sit down and talk about it and we're just like i don't think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff yknow <VOCNOISE> and you know <SIL> kept them entertained all day long by ourselves yknow <VOCNOISE> there's no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids yknow <VOCNOISE> they're all in daycare <LAUGH> they yknow <VOCNOISE> yknow they just aren't around anymore it's not the same anymore where <VOCNOISE> yknow every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so <VOCNOISE> yknow they've made a lot of friends through there and they still <VOCNOISE> the daughter is in a different school still associates with friends <VOCNOISE> that are in other school systems <VOCNOISE> that she met at the daycare so <SIL> <IVER>
and they don't know any different <SIL> <IVER>
yknow they don't understand the concept so <SIL> they don't know any different of <VOCNOISE> yknow why didn't we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but <SIL> yeah but i still think <SIL> yknow they benefited a lot from it now <IVER>
<SIL> the ultimate would probably be <VOCNOISE> a part time thing yknow if <SIL> but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time work <VOCNOISE> we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is <SIL> they get a little bit <SIL> of both the worlds so <SIL> <IVER>
mm-hmm you can do part time you can do three or two day a week <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
yeah oh yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> it's a job <SIL> it's a full time <LAUGH-job> <LAUGH-I> <LAUGH-mean> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> my wife and i are both like oh <VOCNOISE> i can't wait to get <LAUGH-back> <LAUGH-to> work <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-work's> <LAUGH-gotta> be easier than this <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
because now they're getting to the age where they're fighting more and yknow and you got a boy and a girl and yknow <VOCNOISE> it's <IVER>
yknow always something going on <IVER>
so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> 
<CUTOFF-th=that's> that's <SIL> one of the things we looked when we were <SIL> shopping for homes was we were shopping for schools systems just as much yknow so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and i don't want to buy a house and i don't want to have to move when my kids get older to move into a better school system so <VOCNOISE> because it seems like since we've bought our house the houses are just <SIL> doubling and tripling in value it's <CUTOFF-unbelieve=unbelievable> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> oh i don't know ours is increased quite a lot since we've been there but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we've been there i guess <VOCNOISE> about ten years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> we live rented in grandview <IVER>
<SIL> before we got <SIL> this was our first house <IVER>
grandview has it's own school system too <SIL> but <IVER>
yeah <SIL> oh no <LAUGH> that's one you stay away from <LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we did a lot of searching when we bought our house <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> it's hard to find what you want in a house <SIL> and get the school system too <VOCNOISE> you get in to arlington you get in to <VOCNOISE> grandview places like this or bexley <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the price range we were in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you were gonna have to dump fifty thousand in to the houses just to <SIL> get them up <SIL> yknow we had a list of what we wanted in a house and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> our house was only <SIL> seventeen years old when we bought it but it had everything we wanted <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fireplace full dry basement yknow two and a half car garage yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older houses <SIL> wet basements garage burned down or yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the lots were packed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so we live on a golf course and have a creek in the back yard and so it's really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah they don't yeah they play in the creek they don't play golf yet <LAUGH> <IVER>
the <CUTOFF-ol=oldest?> the daughters are already taking golf lessons <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
so i don't know <SIL> she likes it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> oh yeah it's so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and look in your house <SIL> the neighbors right behind you you're staring at them sitting on their deck <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we got all woods and a creek and then the golf course so <SIL> so that's hard to find <SIL> in the city limits because we're inside two seventy still so <IVER>
yep <IVER>
they put them so close these huge homes and then there's ten feet between them and everybody sits in their little backyard with their fence around it and looks at each other <VOCNOISE> yeah yeah yeah i was just there's nothing and i was we looked at some of those and my wife's like there's no way we're buying the yknow you feel like you're in florida or something <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
<HES-eh> yeah <SIL> where the trees were mature and they didn't really ruin our development and cut down a lot of the large trees <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> for columbus <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> living here all my life <SIL> i don't like it yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i like the old cow town <LAUGH-yknow they can call it what they want i don't <CUTOFF-ge=get> it was easy to get around you'd never had any traffic you don't <VOCNOISE> sit on the freeway like you do now now it's like you don't wanna go out at four o clock or yknow you just don't wanna get involved in it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i don't know growth is good but i guess i'm not into as much as they're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a lot of other people <VOCNOISE> it's good for the economy but <SIL> it's just amazing all the <SIL> every time you turn around they're plopping <VOCNOISE> two four hundred <SIL> home unit <SIL> yknow developments up here and i'm just thinking <VOCNOISE> <SIL> where are these people all coming from yknow you do <SIL> just can't imagine <VOCNOISE> <SIL> where'd these people all move from <LAUGH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> this is getting scary <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah what's the big draw yknow <VOCNOISE> and you know you still see yknow when they opened up a lone star steak near our house they couldn't even do lunch because they didn't have the people <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> right so you know that it's <SIL> the people are just dying for people to work out there <IVER>
yeah <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i not some of them just look like yknow cracker back <SIL> box houses that yknow they put up in a week or <CUTOFF-some=something> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> amazing how you can drive by and then in two weeks drive by and there's fifty homes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because there's a lot of growth in hilliard hilliards that's starting to scare us actually a little bit because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now they just built another whole high school so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> two whole high schools i think <SIL> they were up to two or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> three thousand senior graduates last year <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah that's the worst part there are a lot <SIL> they could really <SIL> double <SIL> they took <SIL> our neighbor is in the sixth grade and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they took a whole elementary school last year and turned it into sixth grade <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> just one school <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> that's how many of those there was <IVER>
um i don't know <SIL> i think they're enjoying and i don't know yknow <IVER>
but it's <SIL> mindboggling that it's because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you're talking two whole high schools two football teams yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just mindboggling all these people you know you graduate with <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know know of hand full of people and don't know anybody else <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's like <SIL> yknow a lot more of a tight knit group <SIL> <VOCNOISE> as a child so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it <IVER>
yeah oh yeah <SIL> yknow people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so <SIL> it's kind of like the small town <SIL> thing <VOCNOISE> which would have goods and bads but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <SIL> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah my parents still live there and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with it's still live in town and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple years ago and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a lot of participation in that <SIL> and so <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> oh i don't know just seemed easier yknow life was <LAUGH-yknow_I_don't_know> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it just wasn't the the drivings the main issue with <CUTOFF-mo=most?> me yknow the freeways we have here weren't built for the amount of people that travel on them now i remember when they built seventy one north <VOCNOISE> i remember when they built seventy east yknow there were <VOCNOISE> no freeways yknow and <SIL> yeah i remember going up three fifteen when they first opened it and it was like no body was on it <SIL> you could just drive on it and it was like an empty road <VOCNOISE> that no body knew about yet and now it's like a parking lot everyday so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ya it's just a lot of different stuff about it yknow that and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it seems like <SIL> yknow <SIL> activities to go do things everything's more crowded it's yknow my wife thinks this city's the eat out city <SIL> yknow everybody <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you go anywhere at six thirty <VOCNOISE> <SIL> everybody and their brother is eating <NOISE> out all the time it seems like constantly we live near a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> we live near mill run which is an area <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they've just built up in the last few years that just has <SIL> like twenty restaurants in it that <SIL> you drive by any of those at <SIL> five six o clock <VOCNOISE> <SIL> every lots full to the brim i don't care if it's tuesday thursday yknow <SIL> <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah or yeah or yknow <VOCNOISE> it's tough when you know you've got kids that <VOCNOISE> are doing softball soccer yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all these events and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow like on thursdays when the daughter plays softball my wife leaves the house at eight thirty and she usually <VOCNOISE> <SIL> drives from work to the softball and after that she <SIL> home by nine <SIL> so she's like i can see how you fall into this drive through window business <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no but luckily yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i pick the kids up so that helps a lot i can get them home we can find feed them and i can get them so that's how our life is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mister mom <IVER>
oh you have to nowadays yknow i don't understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife <VOCNOISE> <SIL> still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that just doesn't happen now now yknow if your wife didn't work you could expect these things but <VOCNOISE> she's doing forty hours a week too so <SIL> it is it's work and it's a full time job <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they start shoot the seven year old just brought here it is the end of the year <VOCNOISE> <SIL> second grade she brings home this project <VOCNOISE> <SIL> gonna have to have a book report use three books of reference yknow she's never done anything like this it was the battle all weekend long yknow getting this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> information out of her yknow she had to pick an animal and do a whole <SIL> report on it she gonna have to stand up in front of the class and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> make a box with a display in it and i was just like this is second grade this seems more like yknow <VOCNOISE> sixth there seems so much more advanced than when we were kids yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i can't believe in second grade we were already writing cursive already <SIL> that's all she writes in now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe might be learning some of it <SIL> <SIL> yeah <SIL> she's in fractions she's doing fractions she's doing percentages already in second grade <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i thought we were one plus one two <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> you know in second grade it just seems like they're three years ahead <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
i always wished somebody would redo a survey on that and say yknow back in sixty five or whatever <VOCNOISE> what's the difference between what they're teaching them then and what they teach them now <VOCNOISE> is it really that or is it just our imagination just don't remember enough yeah <VOCNOISE> it seems more to me and computers really have helped it <IVER>
because <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction <EXT-games> and letter games and <VOCNOISE> yknow at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff it's not game game it's <VOCNOISE> it has a game theme to it but <NOISE> 
<SIL> you're gonna have to do something to get to the <SIL> game play or whatever <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> you can't get them off <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH-it's> <LAUGH-like> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-we> don't have one at home because we're worried of <LAUGH-that> <IVER>
<LAUGH-they're> <LAUGH-like> <VOCNOISE> afraid we're gonna get them addicted to the internet or so yknow <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> the nintendo and those type of things are bad enough they're good baby sitter but you need to limit it <IVER>
um i <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it i think it depends on the child and i think it depends on <VOCNOISE> the adult as far as the supervision of it <SIL> yknow we're very strict as far as <SIL> what games they have <SIL> no yknow <VOCNOISE> it's so wild yknow when we were kids <VOCNOISE> cowboy and indians everybody had guns everybody yknow if you had the best death act you were the best yknow <CUTOFF-clipping=and> <VOCNOISE> and nowadays oh ho <VOCNOISE> don't let him have a <EXT-gun> yknow don't let him play with a yknow even a squirt gun yknow and so <VOCNOISE> you wonder <VOCNOISE> whether it's overexaggerated or <SIL> yknow none of us grew up <SIL> shooting people or this yknow we don't own a fire arm but we played with guns and played cow all these games and <VOCNOISE> so i just wonder <VOCNOISE> whether this is really <SIL> yknow but society's a lot different now <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
and we monitor what they watch <SIL> television wise <VOCNOISE> we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple days a week try to keep them interested in books and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and <IVER>
yeah we got actually we use the grandview library they have a really good library there and a <VOCNOISE> large selection of videos and they have <VOCNOISE> story time things where they read to the kids and get them interested in books and yknow <SIL> different type of things where you can <VOCNOISE> win things for reading amount of books <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah it's great you know and they like it they sing a song they yknow <VOCNOISE> interact with other kids and <SIL> learn to use the library yknow nowadays yknow <VOCNOISE> people don't go to the library as much either on they you get your information off the internet or <VOCNOISE> you buy a books or yknow <SIL> yeah <SIL> yknow so <VOCNOISE> i just we've felt that if we <SIL> <CUTOFF-clipping=introduce> <SIL> introduce them now that <VOCNOISE> hopefully this will lead on to later in <VOCNOISE> with this way you can monitor their television we let them <SIL> rent a couple movies here and there <VOCNOISE> but we see what they rent or yknow take out compared to yknow the cartoon network and all these crazy it's just <VOCNOISE> cartoons just seem so worthless nowadays but <VOCNOISE> actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched <VOCNOISE> and they seem more violent than some of the new ones <VOCNOISE> yknow daffy duck and the road runner and these type of things all it was was kill the fox yknow they have that a <VOCNOISE> so we're just like wow wait well i don't know if we wanna want let them watch that either so <VOCNOISE> yeah they <CUTOFF-clipping=really> and disney and disneys pretty strong i mean yknow you think of disney and you think of kids <VOCNOISE> but you still <VOCNOISE> a lot of the stuff they put out is pretty hardcore for a five year old or so i mean yknow a lot of the <SIL> dinosaurs and all kinds of stuff it's it's of violent nature <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> you gotta <SIL> if you balance it i think you'll be all right <VOCNOISE> oh yeah absolutely yeah <SIL> it's tough sometimes <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> to read the paper at the <LAUGH-same> <LAUGH-time> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> like this five year old's addicted to the tarzan he likes tarzan movie that was out so <VOCNOISE> yeah he wants to <LAUGH> we've <NOISE> kind of boycotted him <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> the daughter <LAUGH-wants> to throw it away <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> never <VOCNOISE> don't have to watch that again <IVER>
yeah because they go back in three days <IVER>
now this pokemon <VOCNOISE> now it's the pokemon yknow oh and they're both like <VOCNOISE> i heard somebody somewhere say <VOCNOISE> my five year old can name all hundred and fifty pokemon characters but couldn't tell ya his phone number <VOCNOISE> and and that's true with mine <IVER>

i don't know all the names of them <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and they collect the cards and <IVER>
it's a cartoon i believe it started out <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and the <IVER>
yep the cards with the characters and they all have different powers <VOCNOISE> the daughter has this thing called a pokedex <VOCNOISE> yknow i'm like what's a pokedex yknow she i want the pokedex so we get this thing <VOCNOISE> it's a little computer you open it up you print in the name of the person you want it puts up <VOCNOISE> his picture tells you all the information about him what kind of character is what its powers are what it yknow <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-it's> <LAUGH-just> like it's mind <CUTOFF-clipping=boggling> yeah it is that's what it is <VOCNOISE> of all the pokemon <VOCNOISE> and i'm just like i don't know where it leads yknow like is it any worse than baseball cards or you know <IVER>
probably not it's a fad they're gonna <SIL> move along and move out of it yknow <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
that's what you better hope <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> and you know they're like three fifty for a pack of cards you don't even get gum like we used to <LAUGH-with> the baseball cards yknow <VOCNOISE> yeah you get three you know out of five six cards for three fifty yknow and you're like geezy cow and every time you go the store they got them all on the check out lane <VOCNOISE> let's get the cards <VOCNOISE> now they've done the first hundred and fifty they're moving on to series two yknow and <VOCNOISE> never oh they are they're killing on it they really are <IVER>
yep <IVER>
that yep we went to a thing there they were talking about that that <VOCNOISE> you gotta figure out what the bainby baby boomers <VOCNOISE> are moving into and invest into those type of things yknow <IVER>
those are the mass people <VOCNOISE> you gotta find out and figure out what needs they're gonna roll into like when they get older yknow <VOCNOISE> you get into the wheel <LAUGH-chair_companies_or_something_yknow> <VOCNOISE> somewhere it's just gonna be massive <IVER>
because you know <IVER>
yeah <SIL> the crew they've gone to town <SIL> oh i'm not really no i was born in fifty eight so no i was past it my sister is more of a baby boomer than yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> so <SIL> i'm forty two <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i'm at the end of it all <IVER>
seventy seven <IVER>
yeah that was <LAUGH-it> that's hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again you're just like <VOCNOISE> wow wait what were those people thinking <SIL> um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um-hum yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
and it's it's wild it just seems like the music hasn't gone anywhere because they keep going back to the seventy miha <VOCNOISE> the rolling stones go touring or pink floyd or yknow these are groups from back then where are these people that are supposed to have taken over for these people they're not there yknow <VOCNOISE> and the quality of the music just must not be there i don't know my daughters into the brittany spears and the <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> backstreet boys n sync all this and now we're starting to get into some of that that's starting to get a little interesting too as far as <VOCNOISE> music choices and wanting to listen yeah <VOCNOISE> get them the sony walkman and <SIL> then you don't have to listen <LAUGH-to_it> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> it's <SIL> they <LAUGH-didn't> <LAUGH-have> that when we were kids probably <VOCNOISE> i remember our car had an a m radio in it and that was it yknow <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> on an album <SIL> yknow now the kids are like i want the c d put the c d in <SIL> yeah yeah <IVER>
yep i've heard that too <SIL> i just differ <SIL> it's different and yknow i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were this age or is this worse yknow <VOCNOISE> yknow now then you can talk to some other people that are oh you haven't seen anything yet wait until they just don't even want to be in sight with you and don't wait till they yknow <VOCNOISE> i'm not going on a vacation with you i couldn't spend a week there with you <SIL> so <SIL> you hope that doesn't happen but <SIL> i've heard friends say yknow their thirteen year olds just rolled over from one to the other yknow from the best kid in town to <SIL> yknow i'm running away i'm never going to school again so it's tough and you wonder what causes it <SIL> yeah yeah is it the family yknow where where'd you go wrong yknow <SIL> somebody needs to figure it out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's it that's what i worry about the larger school systems too <VOCNOISE> that's whats <SIL> concerns <SIL> me with hilliard you get such a large variety of people <SIL> compared to like where i was in this smaller group and you knew everybody and this and that it's <SIL> your parents knew their parent yeah your parents knew their parents their parents knew that yknow <SIL> now <SIL> yknow and i walked to my friends house and half her friends if she's going over to play they got to drive them almost because they're <VOCNOISE> they're all around so it's not the neighborhood thing as much <SIL> yeah and you can't let them run around as much as we did yknow we rode our bikes everywhere we rode to the pool we rode down to the store <SIL> and now you're scared to let them ride around anywhere because you're afraid they're not gonna come back yknow <SIL> and so yeah <SIL> it's <SIL> so many different things <SIL> um it wasn't bad <SIL> it was yknow i enjoyed a lot oh yeah <SIL> i watched the first open heart <SIL> transplant i saw <SIL> the first liver transplant <SIL> 
saw a lot of stuff like that and met a lot of <CUTOFF-people> <IVER>
yeah i met a lot of different people in there <VOCNOISE> lot of interesting people <IVER>
um <SIL> i helped them set up different things helped them <SIL> yknow clean them up afterwards prep patients <VOCNOISE> all kinds of different things <SIL> there was a lot of blood and stuff but <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> when you <SIL> when it's not you it seems a little <LAUGH> easier to <SIL> observe i <LAUGH-guess> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> when you see somebody you know it's a little <SIL> more concerning to you i don't know <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> you'd see a lot of different stuff and <VOCNOISE> you hope that the majority of it's <SIL> helping this person out now my wife yknow she works <VOCNOISE> she worked in intensive care open heart surgery different patients like that <VOCNOISE> <EXT-and> that's a lot different than where she is now <SIL> with the cancer because there's so many different factors there you're <VOCNOISE> you know <CUTOFF-wih=?> she says it's so hard to see somebody <SIL> thirty years old and <VOCNOISE> they come in and they have <SIL> uh <ERROR-s=breast> breast cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things she says yknow <VOCNOISE> two or three times a week yknow your <SIL> your heart just drops out because you see that they have their little kids and <VOCNOISE> now you're gonna be going for chemotherapy radiation all this stuff yknow <VOCNOISE> it's unbelievable how many <SIL> it's just hard to believe how many <SIL> people <SIL> go through there <VOCNOISE> they're talking fifty sixty patients a day <IVER>
where she works and this is just o s u's breast cancer place so <IVER>
it <CUTOFF-ju=just> i just <VOCNOISE> i can't believe there's that many people that <SIL> need the service all the time <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there's like five or six different doctors and <VOCNOISE> so she's learned a lot more <SIL> now than cancer because she's never been in oncology at all so <VOCNOISE> it was always just trauma patients or open heart <SIL> bypass patients things like that <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> it's been a whole new learning experience for her too <IVER>
oh no she has to do yeah it's chaos up there <VOCNOISE> it is chaos <SIL> it's i mean they had somebody come in to <VOCNOISE> oversee the whole <SIL> setup to <EXT-see> <VOCNOISE> yknow where they needed more help at whether they needed more nurses or <CUTOFF-the=that> and the guy <SIL> told her the person that was in charge the head nurse or whatever <VOCNOISE> there's no way that person can do that job <SIL> yknow <SIL> they still do it yknow <VOCNOISE> so when you're in charge it's just a nightmare you're supposed to know where every single patient is where their chart is what's going on what room they're in where yknow <VOCNOISE> you're just <SIL> walking around like you're a crazy person all day <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH-then> <VOCNOISE> then it's come home <LAUGH-yknow> <LAUGH-then> <LAUGH-it's> come home to that <VOCNOISE> and it's so different it's i don't know it's just <VOCNOISE> the motherly thing the <NOISE-kids> just <VOCNOISE> yknow they draw to their mothers <IVER>
it's just the way it is i guess but <VOCNOISE> it's like yknow she says if the mother's in the house the mother's on duty <IVER>
because yknow they <SIL> they bypass me straight mom mom mom <SIL> yknow <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah_and> she's just like <SIL> yeah the minute we walk in the door <VOCNOISE> it's like you guys <SIL> clock out <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow> <IVER>
yeah oh yeah the five year old just <VOCNOISE> after her the whole time the minute she walks in the door yknow <IVER>
go go go so <VOCNOISE> it's tough <IVER>
oh they i do <IVER>
i try to be as much as possible too i think it it's very important that <SIL> both parents <VOCNOISE> they see both <IVER>
i do <IVER>
most my friends <IVER>
most people i associate with in this and that are <VOCNOISE> a lot more involved in their with their kids than <SIL> say our parents were as kids yknow <IVER>
oh no <VOCNOISE> no <SIL> i don't feel that at all they <SIL> yknow <SIL> we don't hesitate <SIL> our <VOCNOISE> to get together with other friends and take our kids places i don't remember my dad doing that stuff yknow two or three dads get together and take six kids <VOCNOISE> to the park or something yknow <VOCNOISE> i don't remember things like that <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> he could've been there maybe but <IVER>
yknow we take them to wyandot lake or yknow the zoo or all types of things <VOCNOISE> oh yeah we got a <SIL> the best thing you gotta get a membership to everything that's what we figured out we got cosi we got the zoo and we got wyandot lake <VOCNOISE> and that way you can go whenever you want <VOCNOISE> if <SIL> an hour into the show <VOCNOISE> they're not participating properly <SIL> you can leave and you <CUTOFF-d=didn't> you're not out <LAUGH-anything> yknow yeah <VOCNOISE> yknow that cosi's great we really like that <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> really <IVER>
oh <IVER>
oh yeah we're members of there <IVER>
oh yeah we've probably been five six times already <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
it's huge <IVER>
you can't see it in a day <IVER>
you can't especially with kids <SIL> it's just too overwhelming <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
at cosi <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yep <VOCNOISE> yep there's a big water area it's something to do with the little mermaid or whatever <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> they really enjoy <SIL> all that <SIL> we try to <VOCNOISE> do as much as we can with them <SIL> outdoor type of thing we do a lot of <EXT-camping> <VOCNOISE> we do a lot of vacationing we try to go two times a year at least <VOCNOISE> uh her parents live in cape cod so they <IVER>
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have family in hawaii we have family in <VOCNOISE> virginia beach so <IVER>
everybody's <CUTOFF-co=coastal> <IVER>
everybody's coastal but us <IVER>
and my sister lives in the middle of <LAUGH-Nebraska> <LAUGH> nobody visits <LAUGH-her> <LAUGH> nobody wants <LAUGH-to_go> to nebraska <VOCNOISE> yeah what's out there <UNKNOWN> come watch the corn grow <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> she does <SIL> she comes back a lot <SIL> they <IVER>
yeah they really like it they have a huge house <SIL> in the <SIL> middle of nowhere out on a <EXT-farm> and <VOCNOISE> my brother in law bought <SIL> uh <SIL> his father's <SIL> wendy's businesses out <SIL> and so they own like six wendy's out there so <VOCNOISE> but it's out in the middle of nowhere that was the whole problem we tried to get him to move and tried to get him to do this years and years ago and <VOCNOISE> nobody wanted to move to nebraska he was doing them from ohio which is really duh <VOCNOISE> running five wendy's in nebraska and commuting <SIL> so he was <VOCNOISE> either driving or flying a lot <IVER>
no i think <SIL> <HES-I> think they fly to omaha <SIL> so it's not too bad that's pretty easy to get into <IVER>
they're about two hours west of omaha <SIL> so <SIL> it's different for them <IVER>
they're liking it yknow <VOCNOISE> small <EXT-town> <VOCNOISE> living out in the country raising the kids yknow their big house huge yard dog yknow <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> we keep looking and saying yknow now how's this different or better for the kids so <IVER>
they're uh five hours from <EXT-Colorado> so they still bad lands aren't too far <HES-away> <VOCNOISE> and i guess it's like <SIL> nine hundred miles from here so they can still drive back <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> they come <SIL> at least once twice a year <SIL> back to ohio <IVER>
okay <IVER>
no big deal <SIL> 
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes um <VOCNOISE> undergraduate <SIL> student <IVER>
first year <VOCNOISE> finishing it up <VOCNOISE> oh yeah <VOCNOISE> oh it's definitely the <VOCNOISE> the beginning <LAUGH> <IVER>
the beginning of the end <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yep <VOCNOISE> um grew up in upper arlington <VOCNOISE> not far <VOCNOISE> yeah really those five miles make such a difference though <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> because i yeah because i live on campus <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i live in uh siebert hall <SIL> oh yeah i got <VOCNOISE> i think there are a hundred and seventy of us here for just from my class alone <IVER>
uh four twenty five <IVER>
yeah it's been like that every year basically <IVER>
yeah it's usually like about a third or something <VOCNOISE> <EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> i think maybe two thirds of them live on campus <VOCNOISE> it's just basically getting out of the house <IVER>
<EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> just to get away from my parents for a while <VOCNOISE> yknow and it's kind of good for me just to be away <VOCNOISE> it's part of the experience <VOCNOISE> like learning do my own laundry and stuff i used <UNKNOWN> so bad about it and now all of a sudden <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> don't care really <IVER>
i i don't care about like having to do it <VOCNOISE> like my mom even wants me to do hers over summer i'm like okay <VOCNOISE> fine <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i think so <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> met quite a few people from cleveland <VOCNOISE> and then my roommate is from north canton <IVER>
no not really um all my good friends from <VOCNOISE> well i'd say like <VOCNOISE> out of all my good friends from high school one of them no two of them are still here <IVER>
um i do so much just <VOCNOISE> not uh one of them i see just got <VOCNOISE> back from lunch with i mean i see him <IVER>
every day the other one i don't see that much anymore <IVER>
um well <VOCNOISE> she's got a boyfriend so she's busy <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and she lives off campus too <SIL> so <SIL> she lives out in hilliard actually it's far <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah she had an apartment in arlington and so they wanted to get an actual house <IVER>
so they built one out in hilliard <IVER>
yeah she still lives with family <IVER>
um um <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um huh <IVER>
um <LAUGH> well the opinion kind of like the general consensus around upper arlington is that o s u is not a good enough school <IVER>
for everybody so you've you want to go to ivy league you don't even want to look here <IVER>
yknow so <VOCNOISE> they offered to accept me to med school here <IVER>
okay <IVER>
i'll stay <VOCNOISE> yeah i'm in a uh <VOCNOISE> in the guinea pig class of this program through the medical school where after three years of undergrad i go to med school here <VOCNOISE> like without m cats or anything <IVER>
um i get a <VOCNOISE> b s which they <VOCNOISE> mail to me after first year of <VOCNOISE> medical school <VOCNOISE> like they figure that uh gross anatomy and all that's enough <IVER>
biology experience <IVER>
actually i do wasn't even that sure that i wanted to do it until um <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> senior year and the opportunity came up and i said to her oh <VOCNOISE> this sounds cool <VOCNOISE> yknow i had thought of myself as a uh a chemist <VOCNOISE> for a long time <VOCNOISE> and that this opportunity came up <VOCNOISE> yeah i'd applied to <VOCNOISE> like other places and i got into university of chicago <VOCNOISE> and i wanted to go there and then <VOCNOISE> this came up here and also i mean <VOCNOISE> it's just ridiculously cheaper here i didn't want <VOCNOISE> debt after <LAUGH-undergrad> that's just pathetic <VOCNOISE> um my counselor just kind of found it and he'd posted it and he specially <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> tried to notify the national merit people about it <VOCNOISE> and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school <VOCNOISE> they all <VOCNOISE> one of them is at princeton right now <VOCNOISE> yknow and they're <VOCNOISE> all off at their ivy leagues <VOCNOISE> like basically working their butts off to <VOCNOISE> get in when <VOCNOISE> i'm already in <VOCNOISE> i don't totally understand it <IVER>
yeah ohio state is like a really good medical school i don't <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think they just mainly didn't want to go to o s u like their egos or something yknow <VOCNOISE> i'm thinking of one in particular yknow rich parents just <VOCNOISE> wanted to go somewhere else <IVER>
yeah he they could afford to go there so they did <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i think <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the people who have already graduated they're like the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation <VOCNOISE> like among adults it's just that the kids want to go <VOCNOISE> it it's just thought of as a somewhat party school <IVER>
i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> within the honors program i think there's some really really exceptional things going on <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> one of the requirements is we have to been in the honors college during undergraduate <VOCNOISE> and <UNKNOWN> fulfill all the requirements there <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um you get priority for scheduling <VOCNOISE> you have to apply for it like seperately and i think you have to have like certain <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> class standing and s a t scores <VOCNOISE> or you can write an essay and they'll let you in anyways <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> let's see <VOCNOISE> you get <VOCNOISE> priority <VOCNOISE> for scheduling the i think you go after <VOCNOISE> varsity athletes and disabilities and that's it <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i think they do <IVER>
yeah they do <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> let's see <VOCNOISE> you have to complete either a thesis <VOCNOISE> or a contract which just consists of taking lots of honors classes <IVER>
and they have honors classes which are separate and <VOCNOISE> they're supposed to be with like better faculty and um <VOCNOISE> smaller class size and a little more challenging <IVER>
my honor's class is challenging and organic <SIL> chemistry is very challenging but <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
no it's not <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> regular's enough for me in that <VOCNOISE> and i didn't have <VOCNOISE> i couldn't schedule the honors <IVER>
yes they do <IVER>
uh i almost think the honors would be better just because of smaller class size i have like four hundred in my class right now <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> it kind of helps actually because uh <VOCNOISE> you have all the people in there who are not honors and they don't know how to <CUTOFF-s=study> like the partiers they don't know how to study or anything so <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
it helps the curve <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i have to take organic i have to take um <VOCNOISE> biology chemistry physics <VOCNOISE> and then um i have to complete a major <VOCNOISE> if it's biology i get a break i don't uh i only have to take twenty nine hours of it <IVER>
but other ones you have take the full major <VOCNOISE> yknow some people are doing uh <VOCNOISE> gosh i think one's doing business and one's doing economics and <IVER>
i think they're doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided to take the easy road <IVER>
hm um early admission pathway <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
there <EXT-are> <VOCNOISE> fifteen <IVER>
yeah um the medical school has pretty much limited them to ten percent of the 
<SIL> of the medical school class which is two hundred twenty <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i'll be starting in two thousand <SIL> three <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the first year they made it <SIL> in state only <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um second <SIL> and the second class that they're gonna be starting they have some people from michigan i think <IVER>
yknow they're just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it'll be something <SIL> a little more nationwide <SIL> but they really just wanted to start off with something easy <VOCNOISE> and um they only take national merit scholars in there <IVER>
so <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> national merit scholars also get full in state tuition <SIL> <IVER>
the <SIL> that's why it's mainly appealing to in state people you they pay you to go to school <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah that is one of the uh <IVER>
one of the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> whether if it <SIL> it's a written goal or not that's what they're doing <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah it is <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it seems to me that they don't keep the very very best of the kids <SIL> in state but it gets a lot of the <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> just below the absolute best in <SIL> it keeps a lot of them here <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> where they could go somewhere else <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ju=just> <SIL> just having like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> such a low cost <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> really helps <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think having just <CUTOFF-tha=that> having the word <SIL> honors gives it <SIL> some kids enough prestige that they don't <SIL> totally freak out about not going ivy league <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah parents are very into this um my sister <SIL> <VOCNOISE> has no idea where she wants to go but uh <VOCNOISE> they took me around to all the different colleges to be sure what i wanted <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> they're just like <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> go to o s u <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah well she went with us last time and <VOCNOISE> she liked some stuff but <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> i think she'll end up coming here anyway <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i went to <SIL> me see i applied to emory <VOCNOISE> harvard <VOCNOISE> duke <VOCNOISE> university of chicago and washington university <SIL> so <SIL> i got into three of those <SIL> and <SIL> they they were <SIL> neat places but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> i know <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> oh <IVER>
definitely <IVER>
definitely i'm such a slacker here it's <LAUGH-great> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> from what i hear actually the like the emory and the <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> university of chicago you have to work really hard <VOCNOISE> because they get all the kids who wish they would have got into harvard and then start <SIL> yknow try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works <VOCNOISE> because they're like we already made it yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i mean like it just <SIL> it provides an a <SIL> a window of opportunity for those who really do work like <IVER>
i know the valedictorian of harvard <VOCNOISE> like in the junior class i'm <IVER>
<SIL> she went to my school she just barely works at all apparently <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> like <IVER>
<SIL> nobody <SIL> oh she is really <SIL> plain smart i <LAUGH-mean> <IVER>
<SIL> but you don't <SIL> really have to work as hard there apparently <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i yeah that's <SIL> another thing i hear about <LAUGH-I_don't_know> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i hear about suicide rates when you don't get in <LAUGH-in> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
i uh i think <IVER>
<SIL> yeah i think i got really good uh um <VOCNOISE> i've actually been sitting thinking about it like what departments in school were good and which ones weren't <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> the foreign language is really good they have immersion classes from like at second level <IVER>
so i got into an immersion class here everybody else was freaking out and i was just used to it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um no english <IVER>
totally <VOCNOISE> like the directions and the homework <SIL> and everything is all <VOCNOISE> one hundred percent in german <IVER>
so it and we had like tapes we listened to of native speakers so <SIL> you <SIL> got <SIL> really good really quick <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> my <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> it was like freshman or sophomore year <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah um i took one oh four <SIL> during <VOCNOISE> <SIL> winter quarter <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> so that's all that they required i'm thinking about taking some extra anyway just because i like it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's why i started it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> now i just like it anyway and <SIL> i like their culture a lot <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i've been there twice already <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> yep <SIL> <IVER>
um both times <SIL> i stayed around this little town uh <VOCNOISE> it's like northwest of munich <SIL> so it's southern <VOCNOISE> um mossberg <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> you know of those areas <IVER>
oh okay <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah it was little had a little gymnasium in it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um well the first time i went officially with the exchange program the second time <VOCNOISE> i just went <VOCNOISE> and the exchange program happened to be there at the same time but i didn't go like under their insurance or on the same flight as them <VOCNOISE> i just kind of met up with them <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was more fun without being with <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
without being with them <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i could skip any program i wanted to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow just show up at the parties basically <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <IVER>
i like how everybody's just a little more relaxed about stuff <IVER>
yknow like uh work hard <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when you have to <IVER>
yknow which <SIL> when you should is a <SIL> better way of putting it <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
<SIL> and then <SIL> when you don't take it easy <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during <SIL> lunch time because that's the big meal of day you go home and <SIL> eat with your family <SIL> that's <SIL> really important <IVER>
and then <SIL> um <SIL> like people who work go back <VOCNOISE> until like yknow maybe two to six <VOCNOISE> um the kids are done with school for the day at <SIL> like twelve one <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
oh yeah yeah you work really hard while you're at it <VOCNOISE> and then when you're done you're done <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they're less hyper about like <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> bad things for people to do yknow the the drinking the smoking there's not as <VOCNOISE> strict about it basically <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean you you kind of suffer your own consequences more <VOCNOISE> rather than having society like yell at you for it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no they don't actually <IVER>
um <SIL> it's kind of funny you're allowed to drink before you're allowed to drive <IVER>
so um <SIL> there's <VOCNOISE> from what i hear one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person and had quite an experience with it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean no crash or anything but <SIL> was <VOCNOISE> rather <SIL> scared <LAUGH> kind of shaken up by it but um <VOCNOISE> no they're <SIL> very very serious about designated drivers <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> apparently when you're a car <SIL> um they have a very very <SIL> <VOCNOISE> like zero tolerance <IVER>
for alcohol <SIL> like on your breath at all <IVER>
yeah they do <VOCNOISE> their trains are so cool i love those <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah they are <IVER>
yep <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yep <IVER>
yeah they're they're really good about that <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah they do <VOCNOISE> i thought it was really cool we went hiking in the alps and somebody told us that <SIL> um 
<SIL> if you are determined as having too much stress by your doctor then the government will pay for a vacation for you <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
just they're that into <SIL> being sure you're relaxed enough <IVER>
<SIL> you know and nobody does the sixty hour work weeks like <SIL> some people apparently are accustomed to around here <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
i mean forty is like the limit <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah they do um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think it's something like sixty percent <IVER>
um we pay like forty fifty here <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well there's like <VOCNOISE> and you take federal and state and all that and add it up <IVER>
yeah they have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well okay they do have sales tax but it's added in to the price before <VOCNOISE> so you're not just <NOISE> sitting there trying to figure out what it is <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i wish they could <IVER>
yeah oh my uh <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm in this uh venturing crew which is <SIL> through boy scouts our leader has this <SIL> like <SIL> society totally planned out <IVER>
<LAUGH> he's got this thing like <VOCNOISE> thirty percent sales tax and no other tax at all and then <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> it all <SIL> gets <SIL> i don't know it all works itself out he he <SIL> every other day you start him on taxes and he'll just start fuming <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's uh business man <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> he really doesn't like it <VOCNOISE> like how things work <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it's called <HES-uh> uh venturing crew <VOCNOISE> it's kind of this off <HES-uh> off shoot of uh boy scouts <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it's for ages teen twenty one <SIL> uh co ed <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we focus on computers but <SIL> we <SIL> do camping and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he teaches us a lot of uh business uh business ethic and <IVER>
um professionalism as well <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> it's <SIL> like um <SIL> i don't know they used to have something called exploring posts <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that were directly related and then <SIL> um <SIL> venturing kind of took over for that like <SIL> in still in boy scouts and then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> exploring went off on it's own <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> as a result they took religion out of the program and they put <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they <EXT-allow> like homosexuality with the leaders and all that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know we call it like hippy boy scouts <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> um one of my best friends from <SIL> high school and my boyfriend are both in it <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they bugged me about it for ever to come and like i don't know about computers <LAUGH> so they <SIL> took me finally like december something <IVER>
and and i have an office within the posi- within the um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> program now and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah and it's just incredible how much i've learned <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think i learn more in that program than i do in all my classes put together <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yes and no <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean we have high schoolers in there <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> there's no requirements for what school you go to um <VOCNOISE> but we get <SIL> our <VOCNOISE> <SIL> internet service partially through ohio state <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <UNKNOWN> the vast majority of college students go here <SIL> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um what happened was we know see one of the people on our committee <VOCNOISE> <SIL> teaches in the math department here <IVER>
so he the math server has tons of extra room on it <VOCNOISE> so he just kind of snuck in our account <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i it is legal but i'm not <SIL> sure how related to university is <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't think we take up huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through oar net as well <SIL> which is <SIL> i think it's just up lane avenue <SIL> uh they give us the domain name and all that <SIL> <IVER>
yeah i <VOCNOISE> oh gosh seems like incredible i mean <SIL> i i used to not understand what the right click on windows was <LAUGH> that was like when i moved in and now all of a sudden like <SIL> i can't i installed my own d v d player in my computer <VOCNOISE> like tore the case off and did it <IVER>
it's actually not that difficult but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-it's> it's um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and <SIL> there it is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> um <SIL> let's see what was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <SIL> decoder card was a little more difficult i had somebody else do it for me <SIL> <IVER>
um i have a decoder card it <SIL> what it does is it make <SIL> it decodes the d v d <VOCNOISE> right away rather than sending it through the processor <SIL> so it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a lot faster it doesn't depend on my processor time like it <SIL> the movie doesn't skip or anything <SIL> it it just goes straight through <SIL> um <SIL> let's see <VOCNOISE> no no nothing like that uh <SIL> twice a month we have <SIL> our technical modules which are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we hook up the tiny little yknow green screen computers and the little old keyboards from like nineteen eighty five <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow sit there and tinker on those <SIL> <IVER>
and then once month we'll have a leadership module which is uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the business ethics <SIL> part <SIL> and yknow set goal setting and that type thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then once month we'll just have like donatos pizza <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and like <SIL> just just discuss basic <SIL> and just general things <VOCNOISE> we'll like events coming up we had <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we planted the flowers at murfield <VOCNOISE> <SIL> last weekend and the weekend before <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was it two <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know i can't wait for it to start just because i want to watch it on tv and like i planted those <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> you see the the nick <SIL> jack nicholas golf statue <SIL> in front of the clubhouse i planted the flowers around that <LAUGH> <SIL> no i i don't want to watch it for the golf at all i just want turn it on and see it occasionally <IVER>
yep <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i probably will <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um yeah actually <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> they had just posted something on the <CUTOFF-in=internet> on the email today they have these old machines that used to be <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh they're called three b twos and <SIL> a t and t used to run on them <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and they're just really old and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean just ridiculously like seventies <LAUGH> just ridiculous and he's giving them out <SIL> but the only thing is if you take one you have to finish <SIL> like you have to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> install a disk drive <SIL> <IVER>
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm thinking i may get into that <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> for like summer project or something <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i like this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's more interesting it's a lot more practical <SIL> yknow it's little more problem solving less running around and shooting things <VOCNOISE> yknow um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's like problem solving type <SIL> yknow little puzzles it's <SIL> not as much <SIL> sit in front of a tv and be entertained it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you create your own <VOCNOISE> entertainment <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <SIL> no <IVER>
um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's an ego trip that's all <UNKNOWN> basically <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's like look i can do this <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
you know i was sitting down uh in my boyfriend's room and my roommate was sitting up in my room alone and i had my computer on <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> nobody was sitting at it <SIL> <IVER>
and um <SIL> from downstairs <SIL> we broke into my computer <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and started playing uh m p threes <IVER>
<SIL> like while she was studying or something i think we played this homer simpson stuff <LAUGH-she_got> <CUTOFF-s=so> <VOCNOISE> she got so mad it was so worth it <LAUGH> <IVER>
she's the type of person i love to annoy <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> my roommate <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> we have uh <VOCNOISE> yeah we have <IVER>
typical dorm room <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh we have <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> desks <SIL> and then lofted beds <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> you have the option take your bed down i had to take mine down because i broke my ankle fall quarter <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so it's <SIL> still just sitting down and my computer sits next to it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> the only thing is if you take it down you can only have half a desk <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's still enough for me <IVER>
<SIL> a place for <SIL> computer to sit and my plants sit in the corner and then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i have my little <SIL> paper stack <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> mm <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
you should uh <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> you should be organized i'm not <LAUGH> i have this stack of like groceries maybe about a foot high sitting <SIL> next to my bed <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just when we out and bought groceries and then the commons <SIL> open again <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
oh they it was nice <SIL> actually <SIL> i ate <SIL> a <SIL> lot more healthy <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> um it was cheaper i was getting money on my buck i d <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i actually got paid every day <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they gave us nine dollars a day it was like nine twenty five for what meal plan i was on <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so then <SIL> um we bought like pop tarts and that lasted for like a week of breakfast <IVER>
for two bucks yknow you can't beat that <IVER>
and then um 
<SIL> let's see <SIL> usually go out to <VOCNOISE> lunch at like <HES-some> <SIL> fast food place <VOCNOISE> and then we get together and cook dinner <IVER>
yeah we have a little kitchen <IVER>
uh i've learned a lot about cooking <SIL> lately <LAUGH> <IVER>
<HES-yeah> <VOCNOISE> i i thought <SIL> in the beginning i missed mirror lake cafe so bad because the good subs and all that <VOCNOISE> i don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know why i missed them i don't <VOCNOISE> i go back and now i just don't like it anymore <IVER>
yeah i've been thoroughly spoiled yknow like catfish biff subs those are <LAUGH-good> <IVER>
oh <CUTOFF-the=they're> <VOCNOISE> they're very good <SIL> like you call <VOCNOISE> i usually just call and then i walk down and by the time i get there <VOCNOISE> the subs are ready <IVER>
oh is it <VOCNOISE> it's a little farther <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
no not really <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i don't know what even is to eat down here <SIL> oxleys <LAUGH> <IVER>
oxleys is probably the <VOCNOISE> closest place <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and those little hot dog stands <SIL> those really don't count <IVER>
which one is that <IVER>
<EXT-oh> yeah <VOCNOISE> adriatico's <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> mondays and tuesdays <SIL> they have <HES-the> <SIL> cheap pizza <IVER>
yeah they have a deal <EXT-on> monday and tuesday i think it's like after five p m <IVER>
the <SIL> <CUTOFF-ch=cheap?> <SIL> pizzas really cheap <IVER>
<EXT-oh> <NOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah that wouldn't work <LAUGH> <IVER>
our dorms were cleaner <IVER>
our our janitor is worthless <LAUGH-um> <VOCNOISE> basically it <HES-um> we were complaining about it like earlier during the year <SIL> three complaints have uh formal complaints <SIL> have been filed against him and he still refuses to change the bleach water <SIL> like more than once a week <VOCNOISE> it's really <SIL> disgusting <VOCNOISE> so we had these temps come in one day and it was <SIL> we went in uh like we're in shock it was so clean <IVER>
they did they didn't come every <EXT-day> but yknow they came occasionally and it helped and <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> we mopped our own floor like on the hall a few times it we just basically need the <SIL> bathrooms done <IVER>
yknow and i wouldn't be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here <IVER>
you know <VOCNOISE> i don't <IVER>
<HES-and> <VOCNOISE> i don't know commons i don't i didn't miss bus service i kind of missed because <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> aaron's car is out <SIL> on west campus but <VOCNOISE> i went home and got my dad's a <LAUGH-pass> <LAUGH> he teaches in the dental school but he only teaches on fridays <SIL> so he has that a pass available all the time <LAUGH> so our car is parked <EXT-right> next to the building <IVER>
yeah we're gonna have to give it up by friday <VOCNOISE> because <SIL> the strike's over they won't let us keep it <SIL> anymore <IVER>
oh i wish yeah i do it during summer too i usually work down here <IVER>
just over summer and i use the a pass <VOCNOISE> and then i drive my dad down on fridays <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i <CUTOFF-thi=think> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> they're justified to go on strike anytime they want to however how they <SIL> behaved during the strike was just <EXT-disgusting> i mean <IVER>
like sitting out <HES-on> the street all the time like <SIL> uh <SIL> honking the horns ringing the bells doing the <EXT-whistles> the <VOCNOISE> really annoying chants um <VOCNOISE> i had classes in the b and z <SIL> building <VOCNOISE> that we just had to cancel because they were too loud <IVER>
um <SIL> yeah across streets the dental <SIL> and the hospital <VOCNOISE> so people were really loud down there <IVER>
and we couldn't have class <HES-and> <SIL> in addition they were like trying to tip over buses and throwing stones at them <IVER>
when they drove by i guess <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there's no need to attack students over it and <SIL> i read some article <VOCNOISE> in the lantern i don't know why i read that but um <VOCNOISE> i hate that paper but anyway <VOCNOISE> um i read some article that the guy said he's not trying to attack students he just wants them to get annoyed so they'll <EXT-go> whine to their parents about how the university does it <VOCNOISE> and then they can all fight the establishment and <SIL> <IVER>
it makes me <SIL> angry that people like that even get <SIL> money <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no it didn't as a matter of fact i told my parents yknow <NOISE> university is handling it <VOCNOISE> so well by <EXT-not> <VOCNOISE> giving them the money because they don't deserve it <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
yeah <HES-and> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was just <HES-really> <SIL> disgusting how they <EXT-behaved> <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> a lot of yelling at <EXT-students> <SIL> <HES-and> that was <EXT-really> unnecessary <SIL> i they <VOCNOISE> just totally approached it from the wrong <SIL> point and <VOCNOISE> i mean there were some students that actually <HES-were> <SIL> supporting them <IVER>
and they were being very vocal about it but the vast majority of people that i <SIL> talked to <VOCNOISE> were so against the strikers <IVER>
yeah they were <CUTOFF-f=for?> pro strike were getting money on buck i d's but yeah <IVER>
we wanted it to keep on going <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> <HES-it> <VOCNOISE> they just didn't need to <SIL> do like that and then i think once they noticed that the uh <VOCNOISE> commons were gonna open without them they realized that <SIL> university is functioning <SIL> or was functioning fine without them <IVER>
and decided to go back to their jobs <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=if> if you noticed the first time that they voted <VOCNOISE> they voted down this proposal the proposal that their voting on this week is the exact same one <IVER>
uh nobody really admits it but <VOCNOISE> oh i grabbed the paper because i wanted to see what the agreement was and it's pretty much the same thing <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> <EXT-they're> <SIL> voting positively for it this time <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i wouldn't <IVER>
i wouldn't doubt it <SIL> i hope they vote against it but i don't think they will <IVER>
just because it's been <SIL> three weeks now yknow and <VOCNOISE> not <SIL> only that there's uh something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and <EXT-the> union has to pay their full wages for the work that they miss <IVER>
<HES-and> <SIL> union's not gonna do that <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
hm <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i just think you can't <VOCNOISE> you can't call for across the board <VOCNOISE> raises there definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than what they're getting <IVER>
and there are some people that deserve to be fired <SIL> and there's no way that you can really <SIL> differentiate just because they're in a union they <IVER>
take that <EXT-away> <IVER>
<HES-and> <SIL> it's really unfortunate for the good workers in there because <VOCNOISE> i mean the people at mirror lake are so <EXT-great> <IVER>
yeah they're all <EXT-really> <HES-nice> <SIL> <IVER>
yknow and <HES-they> <VOCNOISE> work hard <VOCNOISE> yknow to make it <SIL> easier on the students <VOCNOISE> yknow totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year <IVER>
just to make it easier on everybody <IVER>
<NOISE> it's good place <VOCNOISE> they even stopped playing the ghetto music <LAUGH> they had this jukebox and it was <EXT-horrible> they played the same three songs with like horribly offensive lyrics and <HES-no> <VOCNOISE> melody whatsoever <IVER>
<HES-and> <SIL> they stopped doing that now <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah probably <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> i just think <SIL> <HES-it's> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> horribly biased paper they don't <SIL> really take their <HES-uh> <SIL> what is it <HES-uh> <SIL> <HES-the> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-journalistic> <SIL> like <SIL> <EXT-unbiased> <VOCNOISE> integrity they don't take that seriously <IVER>
oh it's most of it is liberal <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <HES-they've> <SIL> always find some way <HES-to> <SIL> misrepresent <SIL> like <SIL> <HES-uh> kirwan <IVER>
they always find some <VOCNOISE> silly way to slant his words and make him <EXT-look> bad and <VOCNOISE> it's really disgusting i <LAUGH-mean> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <HES-and> <SIL> since it's not <SIL> <HES-um> <SIL> sponsored officially by <EXT-the> <SIL> <HES-um> <SIL> university they can do whatever they want and they don't have any <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <EXT-possibility> <EXT-of> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i'm looking for a word here <LAUGH> uh repercussions <IVER>
no they're not it's printed at the top every <SIL> on every issue <SIL> that they are <SIL> financially <CUTOFF-s=seperate?> independent <IVER>
so therefore they can <SIL> they're not public they can put whatever they want <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i am during different points of the day <LAUGH-I_don't_know> <IVER>
<HES-um> <SIL> as far as affiliated with <VOCNOISE> a party <VOCNOISE> i <EXT-probably> <VOCNOISE> respond <EXT-to> <SIL> <HES-um> <SIL> republicans more than democrats <HES-but> <VOCNOISE> i think given any <SIL> um <SIL> given any choice of any <SIL> party <SIL> at all <VOCNOISE> i'm probably more libertarian than anything else <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> just <VOCNOISE> yknow it's <SIL> let people make their own mistakes and then <SIL> but don't make me pay for it yeah 
<IVER>
who am i going to vote for <IVER>
i have no idea it's kind of like picking the <VOCNOISE> the least of evils i mean <IVER>
i don't really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for elizabeth dole and then <VOCNOISE> she opened her mouth and things came out <LAUGH-and> <LAUGH> uh she had the best chance out of any uh <VOCNOISE> any woman that's ever run <VOCNOISE> for president and <VOCNOISE> she was <VOCNOISE> in a major party <VOCNOISE> which <VOCNOISE> hasn't happened before <VOCNOISE> and it would have been really funny to see what happened to bob dole over it <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yknow be the first <VOCNOISE> man after <HES-having> run for the office <IVER>
i don't know <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i kind of see al gore winning just because <VOCNOISE> he's the most like <IVER>
one of the <CUTOFF-mo=most> <VOCNOISE> he has the most experience <IVER>
in that <SIL> general <EXT-area> <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
i don't know i don't particularly like <SIL> anyone <IVER>
really <IVER>
although i haven't been paying a lot of attention to it <VOCNOISE> just because <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
yeah and because <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> back when i was in high school in my a p government class i was paying attention a lot yknow like <VOCNOISE> i read the <CUTOFF-g=?> <SIL> columbus dispatch everyday and i read u s news and world report <SIL> for my economics class and i was <VOCNOISE> totally caught up with everything <IVER>
and then i got here like <VOCNOISE> i don't <CUTOFF-wa=want> <VOCNOISE> i don't care <LAUGH> yknow <IVER>
yeah and <VOCNOISE> i i got to argue about stuff there here i'm just kind of sitting around <LAUGH> <IVER>
like trying to cram organic into my head and <IVER>
playing around with my linux <LAUGH-yknow> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah a lot more <VOCNOISE> just <IVER>
different <IVER>
things <VOCNOISE> yeah just <VOCNOISE> keeping my <VOCNOISE> g p a up enough and <IVER>
yeah i really really hate the fact <VOCNOISE> of a government telling me what to do <IVER>
i really hate that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and like affirmative action stuff totally burns me up the idea is wonderful but it's <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=so> <VOCNOISE> it's just <SIL> executed very poorly <VOCNOISE> i mean i saw like <VOCNOISE> during high school how easy it was for me to get in to places i mean the citadel was begging me to come <IVER>
yeah yeah they called me like a few times and just begging me to come i know how hard that is for <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> white males to get into <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> and i saw like one of my friends had to work so hard to get into m i t <IVER>
and then <VOCNOISE> there was another girl who <VOCNOISE> i really didn't think was <VOCNOISE> that smart she's kind of <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> inner blond <VOCNOISE> and she got in <LAUGH> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah it's just <IVER>
i see it working <SIL> <EXT-unfairly> <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> don't think that it <SIL> is just <VOCNOISE> executed properly <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i would almost rather have it <SIL> not at all <IVER>
than <VOCNOISE> have it executed <SIL> as it is now <IVER>
think in the case of a tie it should be used but <VOCNOISE> yknow like if there's <VOCNOISE> a black woman who is <VOCNOISE> very well qualified for a job <VOCNOISE> and a white male is <VOCNOISE> equally qualified for the job the black woman should get it <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> i'm like if test scores are identical and they have the exact same experience <VOCNOISE> yknow objective <SIL> ways <IVER>
they are identical <VOCNOISE> then the black woman should get the job <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> there is no <SIL> to me <VOCNOISE> the most qualified should <CUTOFF-per=person> person should get the job <VOCNOISE> end of story <VOCNOISE> and that's it <VOCNOISE> yknow it's <VOCNOISE> it's best for <VOCNOISE> society in general <IVER>
just employers need to be <VOCNOISE> employers just need to do that on their own <VOCNOISE> and it's tough to be able to trust <SIL> uh business like that but <VOCNOISE> it's a private business they need to be able to <IVER>
yknow they can do whatever they want <IVER>
um <IVER>
i do not like <LAUGH-bussing> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i just don't <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think it's <SIL> it's kind of like you get what you pay for <IVER>
anyway and <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i'm not saying in general but with the experiences that i've had <VOCNOISE> um certain families where they don't <SIL> uh socioeconomically just not as well off <IVER>
it doesn't matter how much money they're given for their education they've <CUTOFF-s=seen> <IVER>
they won't take <VOCNOISE> proper advantage of it <VOCNOISE> because <CUTOFF-the=they> <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> have their parents to look up to <VOCNOISE> who didn't take advantage of it <IVER>
yknow so if it's kind of the mentality if my parents did okay without it then i don't need it <IVER>
so the money's just kind of wasted <IVER>
oh yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
yes <IVER>
hum <IVER>
no i haven't <LAUGH> <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> no i haven't been following it really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it's not that the <VOCNOISE> property taxes are that much higher anyway it's that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> the homes are worth more because of the school system <IVER>
and the safety of the neighborhood and <VOCNOISE> yeah there there are a few things <VOCNOISE> really that go into it <IVER>
yeah it basically <VOCNOISE> feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes <SIL> <CUTOFF-e=exorbitantly> <VOCNOISE> exorbitantly high i mean they it is a little higher but yeah <SIL> it it's not ridiculously high <IVER>
yeah <SIL> it is <VOCNOISE> worth more <VOCNOISE> what i can't understand is some people live in upper arlington <VOCNOISE> and they send their kids to <LAUGH-private_school> <IVER>
i don't understand that <IVER>
yeah you spend the money to live there and then you go somewhere else <VOCNOISE> i really don't understand that <VOCNOISE> some people do it <IVER>
yeah it was pretty much upper middle class <IVER>
um <SIL> and like even the people the maybe their apartments didn't look as impressive but they were making money <IVER>
and like <VOCNOISE> uh one of my friends <SIL> who had the apartment <VOCNOISE> in arlington <IVER>
they had this little apartment <VOCNOISE> she's from <SIL> india <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
her house in india is like this mansion and they have servants there <VOCNOISE> i mean it's <VOCNOISE> really <SIL> impressive just <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> houses are just worth more so you can't get as much house here <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but yeah everybody is doing well <LAUGH> 
<IVER>
yeah <IVER>
it depends on what area you live in too <VOCNOISE> the area where i live in you get <VOCNOISE> little house <VOCNOISE> because you're close to everything <VOCNOISE> whereas you get kind of farther away from the center of <SIL> the area you can get a bigger house and <VOCNOISE> there's some really really pretty ones <IVER>
yeah and um the <CUTOFF-en=?> <VOCNOISE> the uh smaller house like <SIL> bigger squished in areas <VOCNOISE> are <NOISE> uh the older area <IVER>
and then as the <VOCNOISE> community fanned out then <VOCNOISE> they had bigger houses <VOCNOISE> i like living in the old area better <VOCNOISE> i like the houses in the new area better <VOCNOISE> there's one in particular that's just <VOCNOISE> gorgeous <IVER>
they have this <VOCNOISE> entrance and there are these trees on the inside of the house they're just growing down into everything and there are like crystals and they have this one room that looks like a sphinx and then they have <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> this backyard that looks all yknow cute <VOCNOISE> old england <VOCNOISE> it's really really cool house <IVER>
has this little bridge that goes up to the front door <VOCNOISE> and a creek i <LAULGH-mean_it's_cool> <IVER>
um yes some of the guys from venturing crew live there <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah we did <VOCNOISE> we had a um they called lan parties <VOCNOISE> they are parties where everybody takes their computer and you hook'em up to <CUTOFF-n=?> into a network and then you play games <IVER>
yknow we had one of the parties up there and <VOCNOISE> they had this <VOCNOISE> um big like pyramid shaped thing <VOCNOISE> i i forget what they call it <VOCNOISE> it's like a crystal something <VOCNOISE> i don't know but they have a speaker hook up to it <VOCNOISE> and the structure of it makes the sound resonate like crazy <VOCNOISE> they have subwoofers sitting under it and there's this bed in the middle so i ended up falling asleep there one night <VOCNOISE> somebody woke me up with the music ah <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh it's <VOCNOISE> yeah it's definitely weird <IVER>
it's really cool <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
very new age <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> got a few ideas <VOCNOISE> um i'm thinking i might be a o b g y n just <IVER>
they need a lot of women in that field <VOCNOISE> yknow they needs <VOCNOISE> good people there <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the money didn't hurt <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> just <IVER>
it's good money <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um one idea that i've just had recently is medical informatist <VOCNOISE> which <VOCNOISE> is a person who has an m d <VOCNOISE> and does computers <VOCNOISE> since those are my two main interests i thought <VOCNOISE> doing both would be really cool <IVER>
and i'm meeting with someone on thursday actually who's <VOCNOISE> in that field <VOCNOISE> it's really just an open field <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
uh it's <IVER>
it is where bioinformatics was about a year or two ago <IVER>
just really starting to get started and i mean <VOCNOISE> somebody <VOCNOISE> you have an m d that's enough yknow you want somebody who has computer skills as well <VOCNOISE> that's <IVER>
difficult to find <IVER>
yeah the other way around is probably even harder <LAUGH> <IVER>
it does <IVER>
yeah you just see like <VOCNOISE> all the different kinds <VOCNOISE> i think even if i don't want to go into it yknow <VOCNOISE> rotations in every single <VOCNOISE> area will be interesting like <VOCNOISE> i shadowed in the uh <VOCNOISE> psych ward last week <VOCNOISE> and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that was really interesting <VOCNOISE> and i have feeling i'm gonna love my rotation but i <VOCNOISE> don't want to be a psychiatrist <IVER>
no as for it was kind of disturbing actually <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah i saw the patients in the morning <IVER>
yep <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh um well i thought about being a medical scientist <VOCNOISE> with m d p h d they do um <VOCNOISE> research <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> with applications to medicine but more in the <VOCNOISE> biochemistry field <VOCNOISE> or genetics or something like that <IVER>
that <VOCNOISE> that would be seriously fun <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> uh it depends if you work industry you get money <IVER>
if you work at a college <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> a hospital you make <VOCNOISE> no money <VOCNOISE> yeah pretty much <VOCNOISE> it seems like it <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i wanted to for a long time now i'm just not so sure that i want the <VOCNOISE> two or three more years of school <VOCNOISE> they suggest two to three years for your p h d like <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna do that <IVER>
too much <IVER>
um yeah <VOCNOISE> that's <VOCNOISE> what they suggest doing is two years of med school <VOCNOISE> get your p h d <SIL> and then do your <SIL> last two years of med school <IVER>
and then you do <VOCNOISE> your residency <VOCNOISE> you don't have to do a residency but <SIL> if you ever wanna <VOCNOISE> go clinical <VOCNOISE> you have to do it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah just ridiculous amounts of stuff i'm like i don't wanna do that <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i would be at least thirty maybe looking uh towards forty before i have the experience really necessary <VOCNOISE> to get into good jobs like <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna be i mean like <VOCNOISE> my <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> venturing crew <VOCNOISE> advisor is thirty eight and retired i mean <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i i'm going more for there <LAUGH> <IVER>
um a lot of good investments a lot of saving <VOCNOISE> a lot of living well below means <VOCNOISE> and i wanna own six businesses <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah um his definition of <VOCNOISE> retired is basically um <SIL> he doesn't have to work <VOCNOISE> he does but he doesn't have to so <VOCNOISE> he just finished up a temp job up at uh qwest <VOCNOISE> yep i think he gets paid like three seventy five an hour now <IVER>
yeah that's how he gets so much money he says <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> will be paid this much <VOCNOISE> and i will be given this many um had this much minimum per day <VOCNOISE> or i'm not working for you and <VOCNOISE> they usually say no no no we won't do that yknow and then they'll call back a week later <VOCNOISE> okay we'll take you <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> he has some really good stories about that <VOCNOISE> oh yeah <VOCNOISE> he has qualifications businesses and also with uh unix <VOCNOISE> which is <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i don't know do you know anything about unix <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> yeah he does <IVER>
i think he specializes in like solaris and h p u x <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
yeah he says he knows <VOCNOISE> the v m s as well but <SIL> he doesn't like to do it so he doesn't do it <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah he's teaching us uh system five <VOCNOISE> it's <LAUGH-just_funny> <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> like two now <IVER>
okay <IVER>

<SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
alright <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> we'll i've <VOCNOISE> lived in columbus all my life <VOCNOISE> never <LAUGH> can't say i ever really leave too often <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i have a brother sister <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> obviously parents they're <VOCNOISE> divorced i live with my mom <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i live up around the beechwold area <SIL> uh <SIL> really as <VOCNOISE> far as ohio state goes i'm a freshman here <VOCNOISE> uh just started winter quarter <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i like it for the most part it's little bit <SIL> much <VOCNOISE> <SIL> much different actually than <VOCNOISE> <SIL> high school was and that kind of <VOCNOISE> surprised me just <SIL> all the sorts of changes and <CUTOFF-th=they> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> things like that going on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but other than that i mean i seem to like it i mean it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> definitely changes for the better it's a lot more <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just free i mean i get to do <VOCNOISE> whatever you want i mean there's no one <VOCNOISE> watching over you saying what you have to do all the time and <SIL> everything like that <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i am signed up for architecture right now <VOCNOISE> which <SIL> i like architecture but i think there's probably more time <VOCNOISE> into it than i'm ready to <SIL> actually commit into it <IVER>
and so i think i'll probably end up changing i don't know what to it'd probably be more towards the education line <IVER>
um just i mean i like everything about architecture i mean that's actually <VOCNOISE> what i do as a job right now i mean i'm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like building things i'm <VOCNOISE> like adding on a <SIL> bedroom and a bathroom <IVER>
onto a house <SIL> but <SIL> it's just <SIL> more time consuming than i think i'm ready <SIL> <IVER>
to put into it <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes and no i mean <SIL> in high school it was a bunch of little things here it's <SIL> not so much a lot of things <IVER>
it's <CUTOFF-s=it's> <SIL> major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming <IVER>
yeah exactly <SIL> <VOCNOISE> which is one of the things i ran into architecture where <VOCNOISE> i mean we only had yknow one or two papers we had to write <IVER>
but there were one or two <VOCNOISE> eight or nine page papers about a building that you had to go put <SIL> hours worth of research into and then sketch and <VOCNOISE> and it was just <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> exactly yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> actually <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i guess it's something that's always started <SIL> sort of been there <VOCNOISE> always been real big on just building things mean been <VOCNOISE> real big hands on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> last summer i helped my dad <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> put a garage onto his house <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> like i mean literally i mean we poured the foundation and everything like build everything up from there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it turned out really well and i mean it was <SIL> really fun to do i mean <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> i liked it a lot better than being stuck <SIL> inside all the time <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> just ya know sort of doing the same old same old everyday there it was always something different i have to be outside <SIL> and it was just a lot <SIL> easier to do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
um <LAUGH> actually it's more <SIL> it's almost actually turned into like a self business <SIL> um <SIL> like i said it started out with my dad and then people would ask me what i was doing i'd tell them <VOCNOISE> they'd be like oh i have some things around the house that need to be done and <VOCNOISE> so i'd go there and they'd tell people and <IVER>
i'd get more <SIL> people asking me for that and i mean it turns out pretty nice i'm making <VOCNOISE> about ten or eleven bucks an hour <IVER>
<SIL> and i mean it's basically any time i have free i mean it's not like i have a set schedule of when i have to work things like that it's just <VOCNOISE> whenever i feel like i have to do it <IVER>
i do it so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um <SIL> actually oddly enough that's what i'm putting in <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
one of the bathrooms right now is a jacuzzi <VOCNOISE> um that's <SIL> not really too hard but the hardest <SIL> thing to do is electrical work <VOCNOISE> like it's just because it's more intimidating <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> than it is <IVER>
difficult <SIL> exactly getting <IVER>
getting electrocuted or something yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that just doesn't appeal to me too much but i mean it's <SIL> really not too difficult i mean as long as you're <VOCNOISE> careful and <IVER>
think about things i mean it's pretty easy to do <IVER>
yeah we lived <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> we moved about <SIL> five or six years ago <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and the house we had before was some big like eighty ninety year old house <IVER>
<SIL> and <SIL> i mean obviously it needed a lot of repairs because it's pretty old and there were just things that he'd do and i guess just <VOCNOISE> picking up watching him seeing what he would do that's <IVER>
where it took me to <IVER>
<SIL> and it just sort of <VOCNOISE> sparked an interest in me i guess and <VOCNOISE> it just grew from there <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i've run into that a lot i think <SIL> part of it was the high school i went to i mean i've gone to <VOCNOISE> catholic schools all my life or whatever <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> obviously i've run into <VOCNOISE> a lot more of the wealthier type people who <VOCNOISE> either just don't have time or don't have the interest and just pay people to do it <IVER>
and as a result <SIL> <UNKNOWN> like there are <VOCNOISE> kids my age and stuff like that that i've talked to i mean they have no idea what's going on <IVER>
which <SIL> i mean isn't necessarily a bad thing but <SIL> i mean it's something that's definitely noticeable in there <IVER>
oh did you <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah it's <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah plus i mean you <LAUGH> save a lot of money too i mean <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> kind of i've seen a few of like infomercials on stuff like that <SIL> um but i can't say anything too <VOCNOISE> serious has come up from it <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i mean i'd that's definitely a possibility for career wise down the road but <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i don't know i'll have to see <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-sort_of_where_that> takes me <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i went <EXT-to> <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> for grade school <SIL> and <EXCLUDE-name> for high school <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> that is on <EXCLUDE-name> road <IVER>
like ninety nine east <EXCLUDE-name> road or something like that <IVER>
uh <NOISE> <SIL> it <CUTOFF-w=wasn't> <SIL> wasn't anything too huge i think it had about twelve hundred people in it or so <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> it i mean it was <SIL> pretty good place i mean looking <VOCNOISE> back on it <SIL> i remembered a lot better than when i was actually there <IVER>
obviously i mean it was just something that <SIL> just i mean you don't really appreciate it until <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you've gone through it <IVER>
and then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> remember back on it <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't really think there's <SIL> any huge difference <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i can say from what i've seen <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the people that went to the catholic schools <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the <VOCNOISE> public schools are <LAUGH> really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> and i definitely i mean <SIL> i've <VOCNOISE> think i went to like kindergarten in the public school so i don't really know <VOCNOISE> too much about like the kind of curriculums and things that they had to do <VOCNOISE> but i know i mean as far as going to <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> a lot of the stuff like in math and things like that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that i'm doing now <VOCNOISE> is stuff i already covered in high school so i already have a basis for it <IVER>
um so i think that <SIL> part definitely helps whereas most of my other friends you know they're kind of lost they don't know <VOCNOISE> exactly what they're doing <VOCNOISE> um where like said i've <VOCNOISE> already <VOCNOISE> done all the stuff that we're doing now and know <VOCNOISE> how to go about it and <IVER>
how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest differences just <SIL> really the amount of <SIL> education you get 
<IVER>
i would say for the most part that that <SIL> not <VOCNOISE> is not really true <IVER>
um <SIL> i would <CUTOFF-s=say> tend to say most people i know are <SIL> at least fairly ethical i mean <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-there's_no_more> <VOCNOISE> sinister group than the other that i know <IVER>
i mean obviously everyone has their dark side but i'd say <CUTOFF-nm=?> <VOCNOISE> in general people are <VOCNOISE> pretty good people <IVER>
i mean <VOCNOISE> there's nothing bad about them or anything that they <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah all the time <IVER>
yeah that part was no different i mean <IVER>
no <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> there were one or two <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i guess that would be a slightly different part i'm <ERROR-non=not> <VOCNOISE> not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools but <VOCNOISE> mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year <IVER>
um so i'm sure that <LAUGH-probably> increases the rate in public schools from <IVER>
the catholic schools <IVER>
expelling <IVER>
um <IVER>
what they do <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> they have like up to four or five months <VOCNOISE> the first four or five months pregnancy they're aloud to maintain <VOCNOISE> once they start to show <SIL> they don't let them go to the school anymore just for <VOCNOISE> their <VOCNOISE> uh health of the baby <IVER>
um <SIL> so they <VOCNOISE> sort of send them on their way or whatever <VOCNOISE> and she did have the opportunity to come back <IVER>
uh <ERROR-onshe=once> <CUTOFF-th=the> <VOCNOISE> she was through with her pregnancy but she did end up just going to a public school <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> kind of yeah <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-actually_with> this case i do know what happened to the father i think he ended up moving to colorado <LAUGH> um <IVER>
no nothing at all <VOCNOISE> it it was known that he was the father <VOCNOISE> like i said i mean <SIL> he <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> he was kind of <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> just <LAUGH-one_of_those> kids <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i mean he didn't listen to anyone or anything and <VOCNOISE> he ended up <VOCNOISE> like running away from home basically and like i said going out to colorado <VOCNOISE> and like on his drive down there his car broke down and his parents like wired him money <VOCNOISE> for him to get a plane ticket to come back and he ended up just taking the money fixing his car with it and <CUTOFF-kep=kept> <SIL> kept on going <IVER>
so i mean he was just <VOCNOISE> one of those people i guess i mean there was really no hope for <IVER>
um <SIL> i probably would <VOCNOISE> like i said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it <IVER>
um not necessarily the catholic beliefs <IVER>
or anything like that i mean <VOCNOISE> that's <VOCNOISE> something that <VOCNOISE> i don't know i'd sorta <VOCNOISE> make known to them <SIL> but not something that i'd <VOCNOISE> really push on them <IVER>
um sort of let them make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do <VOCNOISE> where they wanted to go with it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> well as far as my mom goes she's <VOCNOISE> real into the catholic faith and i mean she made me <VOCNOISE> always go to church and things like that <IVER>
and i think that's probably why i feel the way i do now <IVER>
why i wouldn't push it on them <VOCNOISE> cause that's almost made me be resentful towards being catholic just the fact that i had it forced on me <IVER>
for <VOCNOISE> about seventeen or eighteen years <VOCNOISE> and just reached the point where i'd <VOCNOISE> had enough of it and i mean i didn't want <VOCNOISE> anything about it <IVER>
and i mean that's not to say that <SIL> i don't <SIL> like being catholic or whatever <IVER>
it doesn't so much bother me it's just having it forced on me <VOCNOISE> like i said just sort of gives me a different opinion of it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <SIL> the real <VOCNOISE> meaning behind it so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> nope <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she does know that i don't go to church <IVER>
um <IVER>
she <VOCNOISE> doesn't so much mind anymore <VOCNOISE> i mean since i've <VOCNOISE> turned <SIL> eighteen <VOCNOISE> i mean ever since then it's been no <VOCNOISE> problem or anything i mean she's sort of let me have my own opinion <IVER>
but i mean i honestly do think i'd at least go to church on occasion if <VOCNOISE> it wasn't forced on me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean it just got sort of <CUTOFF-ri=ridiculous> <VOCNOISE> just <VOCNOISE> to the point of being <LAUGH-ridiculous> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-going> <VOCNOISE> seventeen eighteen years <VOCNOISE> every single week <IVER>
of the year i mean <VOCNOISE> it just got to the point where <VOCNOISE> i'd had enough and <VOCNOISE> i didn't wanna <LAUGH-go_anymore> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <EXT-my> both of them are older <VOCNOISE> my <EXT-sister's> like twenty seven twenty eight and my brother's twenty four <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> they have started again recently <VOCNOISE> uh they sort of hit the same point where <VOCNOISE> they'd just had enough of it too and stopped <IVER>
um but <SIL> recently they are <VOCNOISE> getting into going to church <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
um neither one of them's married or has kids <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> my <EXT-sister> <VOCNOISE> does <ERROR-hasv=have boyfriend for um <VOCNOISE> probably like three years or so <VOCNOISE> and there is talk about them <SIL> like marriage and kids and stuff like that with them <IVER>
um like they're living together things like that <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> as far as my brother goes <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_can't> say i <LAUGH-really> see my brother too often <VOCNOISE> um he does live in town <VOCNOISE> um but <SIL> usually he's <SIL> either at work because he works fulltime then he has <VOCNOISE> he's a part time student columbus state <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so i don't really see him during the day and then <VOCNOISE> at night he usually goes out does his thing i go out and do my thing <VOCNOISE> so i mean as far as what's going on with him <VOCNOISE> i really don't know but <CUTOFF-i=it> i know i mean there's nothing <VOCNOISE> real serious <LAUGH-going_on> with him or anything like that <SIL> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> not really <VOCNOISE> he <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> he <VOCNOISE> obviously <LAUGH-went> to church too <VOCNOISE> for <SIL> at least a few years <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> while they were <VOCNOISE> my parents were still together <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean since then i mean there's really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> nothing about him <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not really i mean <VOCNOISE> she <VOCNOISE> i don't <LAUGH-know> my mom's kind of weird like that she <VOCNOISE> she more believes in the religion aspects of it <SIL> not so much as what the catholics believe about it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> like their views on outside of religious matters <IVER>
um she just more <ERROR-agreeds=agrees> <CUTOFF-towar=towards> <VOCNOISE> with their <VOCNOISE> views of god or what not <IVER>
as opposed to what the catholic church actually thinks is correct and <IVER>
what should be done <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> probably would've been about six years ago <VOCNOISE> i'd been in <VOCNOISE> sixth or seventh grade <IVER>
yeah i lived with my mom since then <IVER>
uh my dad is remarried <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <EXT-he's> <SIL> probably been married for <VOCNOISE> four or five years <IVER>
she's pretty nice i mean <VOCNOISE> she's <VOCNOISE> definitely at least standable and <IVER>
acceptable so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> yes and no <VOCNOISE> like i said i think the average person <VOCNOISE> is pretty decent person i mean i don't think that <VOCNOISE> there's <VOCNOISE> anything violent or that <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-there's> anything wrong with them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but at the same time <VOCNOISE> it's just the media focuses on the one's that are out of control and makes a big deals of <VOCNOISE> the ones that are out of control <VOCNOISE> and i think that sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they don't <VOCNOISE> they don't show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high school's <VOCNOISE> like volunteering at <VOCNOISE> like the local senior citizens' home or something like that <IVER>
instead they pick up on oh so and so was arrested for drug dealing today he <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> so and so age and <VOCNOISE> they sort of give background on him and that's <SIL> what everyone bases their view on <VOCNOISE> it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what's going on <VOCNOISE> when the media's only showing one side of the story i mean there's definitely much more out there <VOCNOISE> that's going on than they're <VOCNOISE> telling you <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so i really don't see a big <SIL> problem with <VOCNOISE> the way <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> america's going or whatever the youth <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and like say i wouldn't say it's any <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-worse> than any past generations <VOCNOISE> i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that are being around <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> simply the reason being was because in past generations they weren't around for it <IVER>
um i mean <VOCNOISE> 
there were things out but there's nothing like what they have today you know the small little hand guns and things like that they're real easy <VOCNOISE> carryable and concealable i mean <SIL> like you know back in the sixties stuff like that i mean they had switchblades things <LAUGH-like_that> yeah i mean <VOCNOISE> i mean there's really nothing <VOCNOISE> too different <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> i sort of agree with the fact that <SIL> if someone wants a gun they'll get a gun <VOCNOISE> it doesn't matter what they do to try to make it <SIL> so people can't get their hands on guns <VOCNOISE> they're basically always gonna be around and people are always gonna get them if they want them <IVER>
i think more what they need to do is <SIL> in strict <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> because i mean for the most part <VOCNOISE> i mean people really don't get <VOCNOISE> too badly punished for things <VOCNOISE> i mean if you look in other countries i mean <VOCNOISE> like people <VOCNOISE> like the <VOCNOISE> asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws <VOCNOISE> i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism you're still serving jail time and you get <LAUGH> you get pretty badly punished for it <VOCNOISE> i mean some cases they'll even <SIL> chain you up and beat you in public for it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way <VOCNOISE> that there'd be a much less problem with it <VOCNOISE> um i think just the fact that the jails are so over crowded now that they know that they're gonna get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff <VOCNOISE> that if you shoot someone you're <VOCNOISE> you're not even gonna get thirty days in jail and <VOCNOISE> you're gonna be <VOCNOISE> let go i mean that's an awfully small price to pay for <IVER>
just carrying around a gun and shooting someone <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i don't really know honestly i mean <VOCNOISE> it's definitely careless nature and definitely something has to be done to 'em <IVER>
but at the same time it's not like they had the intent <SIL> to do it <VOCNOISE> so i can't say anything too incredibly severe <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but i mean i almost think it should be <NOISE> considered basically <SIL> child neglect things like that um <VOCNOISE> basically the same penalties that you'd run into for that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i mean <UNKNOWN> they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids <VOCNOISE> has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> i mean that's just <VOCNOISE> sort of the curious nature of kids i mean they <VOCNOISE> obviously they're gonna <VOCNOISE> get into stuff and things like that and i mean it's not always the <VOCNOISE> parent's fault i mean <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-kn=know> there are a lot of people i mean <VOCNOISE> i think just in the news a few weeks ago they <VOCNOISE> had a shooting that happened couple of years ago and they just came to a verdict on it <VOCNOISE> and the parent like left in a <CUTOFF-t=top> top drawer of a tool shed that was locked <VOCNOISE> and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked it and he ended up shooting himself with it <VOCNOISE> i mean as far as that goes i mean there's really nothing more he could do i mean <IVER>
yeah i mean <IVER>
it's just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that's <SIL> sort of kids for you i mean they just <VOCNOISE> obviously they're gonna be curious about things <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it <VOCNOISE> but i don't know <CUTOFF-w=what> to what degree <VOCNOISE> that they should go with it <IVER>
nothing serious no <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> not really i mean <VOCNOISE> i've been with a few people that have <SIL> just <NOISE> i mean just <VOCNOISE> randomly gotten kind of jumped i mean they didn't steal anything they just <VOCNOISE> beat them up for no reason or what not <IVER>
but i mean it's was nothing too serious or violent i mean <IVER>
they didn't like pull out any weapon or anything like that it was just a fistfight yeah <IVER>
happened sometime <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> probably would've been my <CUTOFF-ow=?> <SIL> my freshman year in high school <VOCNOISE> um we were just <VOCNOISE> walking down high street and <LAUGH> i guess we were <VOCNOISE> wrong place at the wrong time and <VOCNOISE> some people <VOCNOISE> were like yelling stuff <VOCNOISE> and we couldn't make out what they were saying <IVER>
and one of my friends was like what'd you say <VOCNOISE> and he took that as like a threat or something like walked over <IVER>
and just <LAUGH-started> picking a fight with him <IVER>
just <IVER>
to beat him up <VOCNOISE> but <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um <IVER>
they probably would've been <VOCNOISE> um about seniors in high school or so <IVER>
juniors or seniors in high school i mean it wasn't anything too <VOCNOISE> serious it was just more <VOCNOISE> i guess a testosterone trip or something <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh <UNKNOWN> definitely yeah like i said <UNKNOWN> parts no different <IVER>
uh <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> it's probably would be worse <VOCNOISE> i mean actually <VOCNOISE> just wait for my last experiments i heard couple people talking about it they were talking about it <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i can say <VOCNOISE> there are some drugs that <SIL> i don't really consider to be too threatening or <VOCNOISE> that i'm really too worried about people using <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> like i mean just the whole idea with marijuana things like that i mean <SIL> it doesn't really <VOCNOISE> bother me so much i mean <VOCNOISE> cigarettes and alcohol basically do the same thing it does <IVER>
and i mean those are legal <VOCNOISE> obviously <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> obviously things like once you start getting into cocaine p c p things like that those are a little bit more serious <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> obviously a lot more dangerous and <VOCNOISE> i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with <VOCNOISE> the bigger drugs <VOCNOISE> once you get it to like college or whatever <IVER>
as back into <CUTOFF-gr=grade?> into high school <IVER>
um <IVER>
i've been to parties and things like that where people were shooting up with like heroin and things like that <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> i mean that's <VOCNOISE> pretty <VOCNOISE> i don't know extreme yeah <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so i mean it's definitely i would say this more serious drugs are definitely <IVER>
much more widely used once you get into college <VOCNOISE> um but i mean as far as like the pot and just things like that i mean i can't say i see any difference between <IVER>
here and high school <VOCNOISE> ecstasy is the drug i've been hearing about <VOCNOISE> a <LAUGH> a lot the past <SIL> like year or two and it's definitely something that's grown <IVER>
just like almost out of control <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> it's pretty <VOCNOISE> dangerous drug i would say for the most part <VOCNOISE> um not so much <VOCNOISE> the getting high part of it but just what goes into it <IVER>
uh like i know one of the <VOCNOISE> poisons used in it is like rat poison or something like that <VOCNOISE> i mean just obviously the idea of putting rat poison into you when it's meant to kill a rat <VOCNOISE> obviously seems pretty dangerous <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <IVER>
ecstasy yes <VOCNOISE> there are a few people that i know that <VOCNOISE> use it <IVER>
like on a fairly regular basis even <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i mean nothing's happened to them and <VOCNOISE> i mean like i said <VOCNOISE> the high getting high part of it <VOCNOISE> isn't so much of the problem it's just what goes into it <IVER>
um so i mean basically <VOCNOISE> my opinion on that is just leave it up to them <VOCNOISE> i mean if they wanna take the risks obviously they know <LAUGH> <IVER>
the risks and what goes into it <VOCNOISE> and like i said i mean it doesn't really hurt anyone the high part of it <IVER>
um i mean basically all they do is sit on the couch and <LAUGH> and smile and laugh at basically anything that's said for four or five hours <IVER>
and i mean that's about it but 
<VOCNOISE> no i mean <VOCNOISE-it's_nothing_crazy> where they <VOCNOISE-think_they're> god and <IVER>
<HES-um> <IVER>
yeah one of <EXT-my> <SIL> uh <SIL> friends cousins went <VOCNOISE-to> that fraternity <SIL> <NOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <EXT-I> <SIL> don't remember what the cause was of his <VOCNOISE-death> <SIL> um <SIL> but i mean like said i mean that definitely <VOCNOISE-it's> a dangerous drug to be using <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i mean not <VOCNOISE-to_say> that they should <VOCNOISE-legalize> it or <VOCNOISE-anything> i mean obviously <SIL> that's pretty extreme to do <VOCNOISE> <HES-but> <SIL> like i <VOCNOISE-said> i mean it's something <EXT-more> to where <VOCNOISE-people> should know the risks of it <VOCNOISE> and know what goes <VOCNOISE-into> it <VOCNOISE> i mean it's sorta like if you saw <EXT-something> <SIL> laying on the street and you <VOCNOISE-decided_to> <SIL> eat it or whatever <IVER>
i <HES-mean> <SIL> you don't know <VOCNOISE-anything> behind it or what's going into it why would you do something like <VOCNOISE-that> <IVER>
um <SIL> if you're going to do something like <VOCNOISE-that> you better at least <LAUGH-know> <SIL> the <VOCNOISE-risks> involved <VOCNOISE-into> it and <EXT-what> <SIL> exactly you're doing <SIL> before you do <VOCNOISE-anything> like that <IVER>
not at all <IVER>
<EXT-no> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
<HES-I> <SIL> i don't think anyone really <VOCNOISE> affected anyone <CUTOFF-to=too> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-too> much <VOCNOISE> as far as that goes <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <HES-um> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> like i <VOCNOISE-said> i mean it's something <SIL> i <EXT-basically> <SIL> see it almost as being the <VOCNOISE-same> thing as like cigarettes or whatever <VOCNOISE> <EXT-where> <SIL> i mean yeah it's bad for you there's a lot of <VOCNOISE-tar> in it things like <VOCNOISE-that> <VOCNOISE> <HES-but> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-as> far as <SIL> what it <SIL> the effects it does to you it's no worse <VOCNOISE-than_anything> alcohol can do <VOCNOISE-to> you <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> so i <HES-mean> <SIL> i don't know i mean <SIL> i'm not sure if <VOCNOISE-they_should> actually go so far as to legalize it but i don't think it's <EXT-really> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-something> that they need to really spend that <VOCNOISE-much_time_trying> to control drug <EXT-problem> <EXT-wise> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-things> coming in i mean i <EXT-know> <SIL> i think it's like <VOCNOISE-Switzerland> or somewhere like <VOCNOISE-that> where they've legalized <EXT-drugs> <VOCNOISE> and they basically do it government <VOCNOISE-based> <VOCNOISE> where <VOCNOISE-the> government <SIL> actually gives them out <SIL> and the government gets the money for it <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i can almost see that as <EXT-being> <SIL> almost a good idea <EXT-here> <VOCNOISE> i mean obviously like i said <VOCNOISE-people> are gonna do it <SIL> no matter what i mean the same thing <VOCNOISE-with> <EXT-guns> <VOCNOISE> if <VOCNOISE-they> want it they'll get their hands on it doesn't matter what they have to do <VOCNOISE-to> it <SIL> <EXT-they'll> <SIL> they'll <LAUGH-come_by_it> <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> i mean actually i mean i could see that <SIL> they <EXT-could> <VOCNOISE> at <VOCNOISE-least_take> the money from and put it <EXT-to> <VOCNOISE> better <EXT-use> of some sorts if they did the <VOCNOISE-same_kinda_thing> <IVER>
not really no <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<HES-um> <VOCNOISE> it would a little bit <SIL> but at <VOCNOISE-the_same_time> <SIL> i mean it was <VOCNOISE-obviously> a long time ago i mean i don't know how <CUTOFF-mu=much> <SIL> how far in the <VOCNOISE-past> you have to <EXT-go> <VOCNOISE> for <VOCNOISE-things_to> be considered a problem of something coming up again <VOCNOISE> um i mean as long as he's not <SIL> didn't have any <VOCNOISE-history> of being like an addicted <EXT-user> <HES-or> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-anything> like <VOCNOISE-that> <SIL> i mean i <SIL> i can't <VOCNOISE-say> it really bothers me <VOCNOISE-too> much <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <HES-honestly> <SIL> it would <HES-be> <VOCNOISE> i'd probably base <VOCNOISE-the> decision <VOCNOISE-basically> <CUTOFF-pol=political> <SIL> political <VOCNOISE> um i can't <VOCNOISE-say> i'd really hold that <VOCNOISE-against> him or <VOCNOISE-anything> <VOCNOISE> obviously <VOCNOISE-it's> not <VOCNOISE-something> i'd be like oh good well <VOCNOISE-let's> vote for him <VOCNOISE-since_he> did that <IVER>
but <SIL> at <VOCNOISE-the_same> time i don't <VOCNOISE-think> i'd really hold it against him <IVER>
<HES-um> i mean <VOCNOISE-obviously> it's something that <SIL> happens <EXT-everyday> <HES-and> <SIL> things <VOCNOISE-like_that> <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <LAUGH> like <VOCNOISE-said> by no means am i <VOCNOISE-saying> yay go president clinton or anything <VOCNOISE-like_that> but <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> i mean i can't <VOCNOISE-say> i'd hold it <VOCNOISE-against> him for doing something like <VOCNOISE-that> i mean <VOCNOISE-it's_nothing> that threatened the <VOCNOISE-nation> or whatever <IVER>
i mean it's something he <VOCNOISE-has> to deal <VOCNOISE-with_he> has to deal with the problems with him <IVER>
<EXT-it's> up to him to resolve it <IVER>
i mean <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i <VOCNOISE-think> <EXT-more> <EXT-of> <VOCNOISE> along the <EXT-lines> <HES-of> <SIL> like physical abuses things like that <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> would <EXT-be> probably <VOCNOISE-crossing> the <EXT-line> <VOCNOISE> um like if <VOCNOISE-he> got <SIL> there were <EXT-alleges> <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-alleg=alleged> <SIL> uh excuse me <VOCNOISE> he was allegedly beating his wife or <VOCNOISE-something> like that <LAUGH-obviously> then yeah <HES-then> <SIL> that would cause a problem with <VOCNOISE-me> <HES-I'd> <SIL> i can't say that <SIL> i would vote for anyone like <VOCNOISE-that> <VOCNOISE> <HES-but> <SIL> i <HES-mean> just like small <VOCNOISE-things> like <VOCNOISE-that> <SIL> <EXT-where> it doesn't <EXT-really> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-threaten> the <VOCNOISE-nation> or <VOCNOISE-anything> and i mean it's <EXT-something> <SIL> that <EXT-happened> <IVER>
<SIL> i can't really see a problem <VOCNOISE-with> it <VOCNOISE> um but like i <VOCNOISE-said> i mean <EXT-if> he's <LAUGH-going_around> <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> picking fights things like <VOCNOISE-that> <VOCNOISE> <HES-then> <SIL> i <HES-mean> <SIL> i can't say i'd support anyone like <VOCNOISE-that> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i can't say that'd really bother me <VOCNOISE> like i said i mean <EXT-it's> something that's his choice his opinion what not <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> i mean it's up to him it doesn't <SIL> affect the <VOCNOISE-nation> <EXT-any> <HES-or> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-anything> like <VOCNOISE-that> i mean he's still <VOCNOISE> long he's making the right decisions or whatever <VOCNOISE> <HES-then> <IVER>
yeah i mean i can't say that they <SIL> be any difference with them <IVER>
<HES-um> <VOCNOISE> they did <EXT-briefly> like cover <VOCNOISE-things_like_that_with> like <VOCNOISE> religion and <VOCNOISE-health> classes things <VOCNOISE-like_that> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i mean they didn't really do <VOCNOISE-anything> too extensive on it they <NOISE-basically> as far as religion classes go they basically told what <VOCNOISE-the_Catholic> church believed about it <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> how they felt about it but i <NOISE-mean> they didn't <EXT-really> <EXT-condemn> <HES-or> <SIL> support it or <VOCNOISE-anything> like <VOCNOISE-that> i mean <EXT-they> <SIL> they <VOCNOISE-basically> did realize that it's <HES-more> <SIL> up to the person i mean <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-to> the most part yeah i mean <VOCNOISE-obviously> like <VOCNOISE-they_said> they <VOCNOISE-came> out and said <VOCNOISE-the_Catholic> <EXT-Church> <SIL> was <EXT-against> <SIL> it <SIL> but at the same <VOCNOISE-time> <VOCNOISE> like with the research things like that <EXT-where> <SIL> they're saying that it could be a mental disorder of some <VOCNOISE-sorts> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-where> i <EXT-mean> <SIL> they couldn't <VOCNOISE-can't_so> much really condemn it <SIL> <VOCNOISE-to> <SIL> to the point anymore <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE-they> used <VOCNOISE-to> <IVER>
um <IVER>
a few <VOCNOISE-times> that they did <CUTOFF-ex=?> <SIL> specifically <EXT-say> <VOCNOISE> um homosexuality <SIL> but <SIL> i mean there were other <VOCNOISE-things> that <VOCNOISE-they'd> cover <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE-it's> not like it was <VOCNOISE-just> an <VOCNOISE> all out <VOCNOISE-assault> on being gay or <VOCNOISE-anything_like_that> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<HES-um> <SIL> i really did not no <IVER>
<HES-um> <SIL> college wise i don't <HES-know> <NOISE> <SIL> anyone of college <VOCNOISE> age <VOCNOISE-that's> gay <IVER>
i do know a few <EXT-people> <SIL> that are <EXT-gay> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <EXT-they're> <VOCNOISE> in their thirties <IVER>
or so <IVER>
<HES-um> <SIL> they <EXT-were> people i met through friends <SIL> um <SIL> <EXT-actually> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> one of my <EXT-friend's> parents <SIL> had a friend that was <EXT-gay> <VOCNOISE> um and <SIL> just be over there whatever <SIL> i mean i can't say <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_see_any> big difference between <IVER>
gay people or <SIL> straight people so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> i would <VOCNOISE-say> <SIL> it doesn't <LAUGH-really_matter> either way honestly <VOCNOISE> i <EXT-mean> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-fact> of the matter is they <EXT-are> so deal <VOCNOISE-with> it i <EXT-mean> <SIL> get over it i mean 
<VOCNOISE> obviously it's not something new that's <SIL> been coming <LAUGH-around> i mean it's obviously been around for a long time <IVER>
and <SIL> i mean <SIL> yeah if they find the cause of it whatever you know that's good but <SIL> at the same time it <NOISE> the cause of it doesn't really matter <VOCNOISE> i mean the fact of matter is it's there they have to deal with it so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
if they <VOCNOISE> had a way to cure it then fine <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> leave that up to the people <IVER>
don't say oh well <VOCNOISE> your son's gonna be gay he's two right now let's <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> change this so it <VOCNOISE> so it doesn't come out to be a problem or whatever <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people <IVER>
i mean obviously <VOCNOISE> if <LAUGH-someone's> <VOCNOISE> like thirty and they're gay i don't <SIL> see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> honestly <SIL> i can't say it really bothers me too much <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i mean as far as <VOCNOISE> just dealing with <VOCNOISE> gay people or whatever <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> doesn't bother me at all <VOCNOISE> it's just something <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna <VOCNOISE> deal with or whatnot <VOCNOISE> um so i mean <VOCNOISE> the fact that <VOCNOISE> i mean two <VOCNOISE> people of the same sex are living together married or whatnot <VOCNOISE> that doesn't bother me <VOCNOISE> like i said it's just more something that <VOCNOISE> i don't know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> i think it's just more because it's so <CUTOFF-wei=weird> <VOCNOISE> different than <VOCNOISE> like what you <LAUGH-normally_see_or> things like that <IVER>
but at the same time i mean i don't <LAUGH> dislike them or anything for it i mean <NOISE-it's> <VOCNOISE> it's their choice i mean <SIL> fact of the matter is it doesn't have any <VOCNOISE> effect or <VOCNOISE> anything on my life so <IVER>
i don't know that's kind of a <VOCNOISE> tricky question really <VOCNOISE> because on one hand <SIL> obviously the kid <SIL> definitely <LAUGH-will> get <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> made fun of and teased and things like that <IVER>
during school <VOCNOISE> but at the same time <VOCNOISE> i mean as long as <VOCNOISE> the <LAUGH-parents> love the kids it doesn't really matter what sex they are and they treat them well <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so i mean that's kind of a tough question <VOCNOISE> to answer i mean it's almost <VOCNOISE> it's something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously <SIL> at the age that they'd be adopting um they <VOCNOISE> obviously wouldn't know <VOCNOISE> how to answer that question yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i can see where <VOCNOISE> the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into <VOCNOISE> gay people or whatever <VOCNOISE> um just because obviously <VOCNOISE> you basically mimic your parents as far as <NOISE> what you do when you're young and <VOCNOISE> things like that <SIL> and obviously <LAUGH-if_you_so> <VOCNOISE> had two <VOCNOISE> male parents or whatever <VOCNOISE> obviously you might be thinking <LAUGH> more towards <VOCNOISE> like dating guys and things like that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i don't know if that'd be really a problem though i mean i don't know if that would <VOCNOISE> honestly happen <IVER>
um <SIL> i mean <EXT-fact> of the matter is if being gay is <SIL> a genetic disorder <VOCNOISE> then that should have no effect <SIL> on the kids because <SIL> they should still be <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> normal i guess or <HES-whatever> <VOCNOISE> you want to say <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> as far as <VOCNOISE> being heterosexual <VOCNOISE> so i mean i really can't say that i'd see that affecting the kid's <IVER>
sexuality at all <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
that wouldn't bother me at all <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i can't say that'd <VOCNOISE> really bother me too much i mean it's <LAUGH-the_same> thing as <VOCNOISE> having <VOCNOISE> a woman gym teacher or whatever <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i mean fact of the matter is <SIL> a lot of people out there <VOCNOISE> i guess <VOCNOISE> could be child molesters or whatever i mean it <LAUGH-doesn't_matter> if they're straight or gay or <VOCNOISE> whatever <VOCNOISE> the fact of the matter is i mean they're <SIL> they're out there <IVER>
and anyone you come across could be <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> getting <VOCNOISE> i don't know i guess <VOCNOISE> weird ideas of your kids or whatever <IVER>
i was in the cub scouts <IVER>
so that was like <NOISE> through like sixth or seventh grade or something like that <NOISE-yeah> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i don't think that really matters honestly <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_mean_it's> <VOCNOISE> i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts you're usually <VOCNOISE> eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up <VOCNOISE> and i think by <LAUGH-that> time <SIL> most kids have at least a general idea of who they are <VOCNOISE> and what they <LAUGH-like> and don't like <VOCNOISE> um i can't see <SIL> i can't see them actually looking at like <VOCNOISE> uh their <VOCNOISE> leader or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore <VOCNOISE> um i mean obviously it should be someone that they <NOISE-respect> <VOCNOISE> but i can't say that they'd be like oh well he does it so <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna have to do it too or whatever <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
really <IVER>
i <CUTOFF-d=didn't> <IVER>
didn't hear about that <IVER>
um <SIL> i would agree that i <EXT-think> <VOCNOISE> regardless of your race you should be able to adopt <SIL> a child i mean <VOCNOISE> just <EXT-because> <VOCNOISE> you're a black kid living with like a white family doesn't mean <VOCNOISE> you can't still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of <VOCNOISE> i mean it's the same <LAUGH-thing> with like <SIL> irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it's no different <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can't see it being a problem of any sorts <VOCNOISE> um i mean just as long as they have someone that <SIL> cares for the kid and <VOCNOISE> does stuff for them i mean <SIL> i can't see it being any <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> there weren't a lot but uh there were definitely <SIL> some there at least i mean <IVER>
um <SIL> eh about the same number <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>

<SIL> i think <SIL> people are still fairly racist i don't think it's near as bad as it was but at the same time <SIL> i mean i can't say i blame the white community so much for it <SIL> i would say it's probably both <SIL> the white and <SIL> i guess <SIL> any other race relation's fault <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i mean as far as like if you look at the black communities things like that <VOCNOISE> you have like b e t <SIL> um <SIL> you have like the united negro college fund things like that <SIL> where <SIL> they're almost segregating themselves by having these organizations <SIL> because they're geared specifically towards black people <SIL> and <SIL> i think in a way that's almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community <SIL> because they're not giving out equal opportunity to the people that need em <SIL> um it's sort of like the same thing white people were doing <SIL> you know thirty forty years ago <SIL> where that they had they're <VOCNOISE> white organizations or what not <SIL> um and i think it's sort of going along the same lines where <SIL> there is still a problem of it but <SIL> i think it has gotten better at least <SIL> if nothing else <IVER>
um <IVER>
i think <IVER>
i think for the most part people could handle it <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> obviously i think probably more <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the <SIL> older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole <SIL> black rights movements and things like that <VOCNOISE> um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more <SIL> like <SIL> more the generations of today or whatever <SIL> like basically anyone under the age of about <SIL> forty or fifty or so <VOCNOISE> i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i don't think it caused any <SIL> huge problems or anything like that <IVER>
uh yeah <SIL> um <SIL> yes <SIL> and no they're kind of weird <SIL> like <SIL> that um <SIL> one set of grandparents <SIL> really i can't hear ever says anything <SIL> there's a set on the other side that <SIL> they are <SIL> a little bit more racist <SIL> um <SIL> but at the same <SIL> time <SIL> it i <SIL> don't know they almost set up like a double standard <SIL> for black <SIL> people <SIL> there are black people that they really like and i mean they're actually friends with some black people and there are black people that they don't like for whatever the reason may be <SIL> and <SIL> those are the people that they're racist towards <SIL> i mean it's the same thing that goes with <SIL> white people obviously there are white you can stand they're white people that are just <SIL> obnoxious and you don't wanna deal with <SIL> um i mean it's basically the same <SIL> thing <SIL> right <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah exactly <SIL> um <SIL> i really don't think we do for the most part <SIL> i can't say i <SIL> see any <SIL> real big problems or anything like that <SIL> that occur just <SIL> because of <SIL> the sex <SIL> you are or anything <SIL> i think that probably would've caused a bigger problem than the black <SIL> president <SIL> um honestly <SIL> um <SIL> although i don't really <SIL> see too <SIL> many sexist <SIL> problems i definitely do see <SIL> guys still be more <SIL> like the decision making <SIL> type <SIL> and as being like the final <SIL> say in things <VOCNOISE> rather than women <SIL> and i would see them <SIL> having an authority figure <SIL> that's being a woman <SIL> as causing problems to em <IVER>
i think they would a bigger problem with it yeah <IVER>
um <SIL> like i said it'd just be the old generations with the <SIL> black president <VOCNOISE> where now it'd be <SIL> part of all generations that would still have a problem with it and i think that'd be a bigger number <IVER>
then <SIL> would be with a black president <SIL> and i think it would cause problems <VOCNOISE> um i don't know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it <SIL> but <SIL> i definitely could see here <VOCNOISE> definitely <VOCNOISE> <SIL> would think that people would be <SIL> arguing about it yelling about it and <SIL> making a bigger deal about it <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> probably for the most part i mean <SIL> as long as they <LAUGH> have a <VOCNOISE> political background of some sort i can't say i see any <SIL> real difference <SIL> i mean for the most part they've proven to be able to do <SIL> anything else any <SIL> guy can do so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> not really <LAUGH> i mean <VOCNOISE> i don't think they'd come <SIL> to any more difficult conclusions than guys had <SIL> coming up to <IVER>
uh yeah <SIL> no not <SIL> at all <SIL> no <SIL> um honestly no <SIL> i'm <SIL> pretty shy for <VOCNOISE> the most <SIL> part so <SIL> those <SIL> more types of women i can't say <SIL> i <SIL> really <SIL> ever had a relation with or whatever <SIL> unfortunately although i don't like it <SIL> yeah <SIL> i don't know i just <SIL> i'm a pretty indecisive person i don't like making decisions <SIL> and she's kind of the same way <SIL> so when it comes to what we're going to do or whatever it <SIL> takes <SIL> us hours to decide <SIL> what we're going to do and i mean it just gets us <SIL> nowhere <SIL> i mean even some place <SIL> as simple as you know where to go out to eat or whatever we'll spend a good half hour forty <SIL> five minutes just driving around till we actually decide a place or someone <SIL> says something or <SIL> whatever <SIL> so <IVER>
what's that <IVER>
um i met her in high school <SIL> she's still in high school and i'm in college <SIL> so <IVER>
um <SIL> yes and no <SIL> i mean <SIL> as far as <SIL> the experience goes i mean i don't live on campus <SIL> so i don't get the entire <SIL> college experience you know <SIL> the whole dorms and events going place on campus <SIL> it's more things about pick and choose that i wanna do on campus i come down for <SIL> um so i can't really say it's anything too drastic <SIL> i mean obviously it's kind of weird when <SIL> people are asking what you're doing and you're like oh i'm going to <SIL> you know high school prom <LAUGH-or> something <VOCNOISE> i have parts a little <SIL> little awkward but i mean i can't say it <SIL> it's really any different or anything um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
i <SIL> honestly don't think that that really has much to do with it <SIL> obviously it does <SIL> put the idea in the kids' heads <SIL> but <SIL> it's been there for a long <SIL> time <IVER>
um <NOISE> i mean obviously i mean that's how little boys are or whatever <IVER>
i mean obviously <SIL> being <VOCNOISE> uh being a little boy i remember <SIL> i mean just <SIL> seeing even things like football or whatever i mean <SIL> it's you'd see something you thought it was neat so you'd do it or whatever <IVER>
i mean it goes back <SIL> more towards the curious nature of <SIL> kids <SIL> where i mean i can't say there's anything really different  
whether <VOCNOISE> they're play a video game where <VOCNOISE> they're shooting people <SIL> i can't say they <SIL> see that as being something that affects them <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
once they turn into adulthood and <SIL> they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i don't think that <SIL> has anything to do with it <IVER>
no i mean <SIL> like said i think little kids are <CUTOFF-r=really?> gonna be little kids if that stuff wasn't on tv they're still gonna act the same way <VOCNOISE> they're still gonna be <SIL> walk around with toy guns things like that <VOCNOISE> playing war or whatever <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i think it's probably <VOCNOISE> some of both <VOCNOISE> i think it's probably more <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean <EXT-obviously> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they are gonna have different views on how things work <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i mean for the most part <SIL> i can't see that as <SIL> being too big of a problem <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that then there are women <VOCNOISE> but at the same time <SIL> i wouldn't say there's anything too <SIL> over powerful as far's the <SIL> the number of guys being out there <VOCNOISE> are violent i mean it's something <SIL> that <SIL> unfortunately does happen but i mean <EXT-it's> <SIL> more how you're brought up whether you can control it or not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
all right
